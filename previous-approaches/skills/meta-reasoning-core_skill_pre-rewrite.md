# Meta-Reasoning Core

## Overview
A unified meta-cognitive loop for deciding what to do next. Combines the
highest-validated patterns from book extraction with GOSM's core insight:
all reasoning should trace backward from goals to methods.

The fundamental question is not "what should I do?" but "what am I trying
to achieve, and is this the best method for that?"

## Steps

### Step 1: Goal-Structure Reconstruction
Trace backward from the request to foundational goals

**Output**: A "story" from foundational goals to this request:
Ch1: Intrinsic goal (wellbeing, knowledge, etc.)
Ch2: What that requires...
...
Final: This specific request


### Step 2: Failure Pattern Check
Check if the goal might actually be serving a failure pattern

### Step 3: Best Method Check
Evaluate whether the proposed approach is the best method for the goal

### Step 4: Intention Check
Verify alignment between stated request and underlying goal

### Step 5: Information Elicitation
Recover missing, vague, or assumed information

### Step 6: Evidence Evaluation
Assess reliability before acting on information

### Step 7: Hypothesis Generation
Generate multiple possibilities before committing

### Step 8: Process Check
Focus on HOW you're working, not just WHAT

### Step 9: Story Coherence Check
Verify the plan serves the foundational goals

**Output**: The plan should tell a coherent story from goals to actions.
If the story doesn't cohere, either the plan is wrong or
the goal-structure was misidentified.


### Step 10: Iteration Decision
Decide whether to proceed, adjust, or loop back


## When to Use
- Starting any non-trivial task
- Feeling stuck or uncertain about next steps
- Before committing significant resources
- When a plan isn't working
- During periodic check-ins on long-running work
- When receiving vague or ambiguous requests

## Verification
{'success_indicators': ['Goal-structure traced to intrinsic goals', '"Is this the best method?" question asked and answered', 'Intention articulated differently than original request', 'Multiple hypotheses generated and compared gradationally', 'Story coherence checked', 'Clear criteria for what would change the approach'], 'failure_indicators': ['Jumped straight to execution without goal-structure reconstruction', 'Accepted stated method without checking alternatives', 'Binary pass/fail on methods instead of comparative evaluation', 'Only one approach considered', 'No story coherence check', 'Process identical to previous similar task']}
