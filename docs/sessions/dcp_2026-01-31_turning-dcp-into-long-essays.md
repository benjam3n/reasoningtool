**Input**: turning dcp procedures into long essays

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

What factors determine how to turn a structured decision procedure into a compelling long-form essay?

| # | Dimension | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Audience Expertise** | How much does the reader already know about the domain? (novice, practitioner, expert) | Determines how much you explain vs. assume, and whether jargon needs unpacking |
| 2 | **Essay Purpose** | Are you trying to teach, persuade, entertain, or document? | Completely changes structure, tone, evidence density, and what you include/omit |
| 3 | **Source Procedure Quality** | How complete, validated, and well-structured is the DCP output? | A thin procedure needs heavy supplementation; a rich one needs editorial selection |
| 4 | **Target Length** | 1,000 words? 5,000? 15,000? Book chapter? | Determines compression ratio and how many procedure elements get full treatment |
| 5 | **Publication Context** | Blog post, academic paper, magazine feature, book chapter, internal memo, newsletter | Each format has different conventions for structure, evidence, voice, and reader expectations |
| 6 | **Narrative Strategy** | How will you make the procedural content readable? (story-first, argument-first, problem-first, example-first) | Procedures are inherently dry; the narrative wrapper is what makes people read them |
| 7 | **Evidence Appetite** | Does the audience want citations, data, case studies, or is authority/logic sufficient? | Academic audiences need sources; practitioner audiences want examples; general audiences want stories |
| 8 | **Procedure Complexity** | How many sections, branches, and decision points does the source procedure have? | More complex procedures require more editorial decisions about what to foreground |
| 9 | **Reader's Entry State** | What problem is the reader experiencing when they pick up this essay? | The opening must connect to felt need, not to the procedure's internal logic |
| 10 | **Competing Narratives** | What does the reader currently believe about this topic? What conventional wisdom must you displace? | If the procedure contradicts common belief, the essay must address resistance explicitly |
| 11 | **Visual/Structural Aids** | Will the essay include diagrams, tables, flowcharts, or is it pure prose? | Some procedure elements convert better to visuals than to prose |
| 12 | **Voice & Register** | Formal academic? Conversational? Authoritative expert? First-person narrative? | Must match publication context and audience expectation |

---

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

### Narrative Strategy Options

| Strategy | How It Works | Best When |
|---|---|---|
| **Story-first** | Open with a vivid case of someone making this decision badly, then reveal the procedure as the solution | General audience, blog, magazine |
| **Problem-first** | State the problem directly ("Most people get X wrong because..."), then walk through the procedure as the fix | Practitioner audience, how-to content |
| **Argument-first** | Make a controversial claim derived from the procedure's assumptions section, then prove it using the procedure's logic | Persuasion essays, opinion pieces |
| **Example-first** | Start with a worked example from the procedure, generalize outward | Technical audience, tutorials |
| **Contrast-first** | Show the naive approach vs. the procedure's approach side by side | When displacing conventional wisdom |

### Structure Templates by Length

| Length | Structure |
|---|---|
| **1,000-2,000 words** | Hook → Core insight → 3-5 key steps (collapsed) → One example → Takeaway |
| **3,000-5,000 words** | Hook → Problem framing → The procedure (abridged, prose form) → 2 examples → Failure modes as "common mistakes" → Conclusion |
| **5,000-10,000 words** | Hook → Problem framing → Dimensions as "what most people miss" → Full procedure as narrative → Multiple examples → Failure modes as cautionary tales → When it doesn't apply → Conclusion |
| **10,000+ words** | All of the above + historical context + competing approaches + deep case studies + original analysis of the assumptions |

### Conversion Patterns: Procedure Element → Essay Element

| Procedure Element | Essay Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Step 0 classification table | "The first thing to figure out is what kind of X you're dealing with..." |
| Binary decision point | "Here's where the path forks. If [condition], then [consequence]. Otherwise..." |
| Budget tiers / option lists | "Your options depend on what you have to work with..." or a comparison section |
| Go/no-go criteria | "The hard part isn't doing the work — it's knowing when to stop" |
| Failure modes | "Where this goes wrong" section, or woven in as warnings throughout |
| Quick reference cards | Sidebar boxes, summary sections, or a "cheat sheet" appendix |
| "When to override" | "The limits of any system" or "When to ignore this advice" closing section |
| Worked examples | The backbone of the essay — expand these significantly |
| Hidden assumptions (Step 3) | Often the most interesting part of the essay — these become the argumentative core |

### Key Interactions

- If **Audience = novice** AND **Procedure = complex**, then you MUST simplify; convert decision trees into sequential advice ("do this first, then this")
- If **Purpose = persuade** AND **Competing narratives are strong**, then the assumptions section (Step 3) should become 40%+ of the essay
- If **Publication = academic**, then every claim from the procedure needs a citation or must be flagged as the author's framework
- If **Length < 3,000** AND **Procedure has >4 sections**, then you must choose 1-2 sections only; you cannot cover everything

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It's Dangerous | What To Do Instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "The procedure's structure is the essay's structure" | Procedures are organized by logic; essays are organized by reader psychology. Following the procedure's order produces unreadable text | Reorganize around what the reader cares about, not what the procedure does first |
| 2 | "Every step deserves equal space" | Some steps are obvious, some are profound. Equal treatment bores the reader on simple steps and rushes past insights | Allocate space by insight density, not by procedural order |
| 3 | "The procedure speaks for itself" | Procedures are tools; essays are arguments. A procedure without interpretation is a manual, not an essay | Every procedure element needs a "so what" — why this matters, what it reveals |
| 4 | "Tables and bullet points are bad in essays" | Some information is genuinely better as a table. Forcing tabular data into prose creates bloated, hard-to-parse paragraphs | Use structured elements where they serve the reader; use prose where narrative matters |
| 5 | "You need to include everything" | The procedure is comprehensive by design; the essay should be selective by design. Completeness kills readability | Decide what to cut BEFORE writing. The cutting is the editorial act |
| 6 | "The reader will follow conditional logic" | "If X, go to section Y" works in procedures but fails in linear reading. Readers don't branch | Convert branching logic into separate sections or sequential "consider whether..." framing |
| 7 | "Accuracy = quality" | A perfectly accurate essay that nobody finishes reading has zero impact. Readability is not optional | Prioritize clarity and engagement alongside accuracy. Simplify where the loss is small |
| 8 | "One pass is enough" | First drafts of procedure-to-essay conversions are always too procedural. The essay voice emerges in revision | Budget for at least two full revision passes: one for structure, one for voice |
| 9 | "The worked examples are supplementary" | In most essays, the examples ARE the essay. The procedure is the skeleton; examples are the body | Write the examples first, then wrap the procedure around them |
| 10 | "The procedure's scope = the essay's scope" | An essay may need historical context, competing viewpoints, or personal experience that the procedure never considered | Add context the procedure doesn't provide — this is where the essay adds value beyond the procedure |

## Step 4: The Procedure

```
TURNING A DCP PROCEDURE INTO A LONG ESSAY
==========================================

STEP 0: What kind of essay are you writing?

  Answer these four questions:

  Q1: Who is reading this?
      → General public (no domain knowledge): "General"
      → Practitioners (know the domain, want better methods): "Practitioner"
      → Experts (deep knowledge, skeptical): "Expert"

  Q2: What is the essay's job?
      → Teach: the reader should be able to DO something after reading
      → Persuade: the reader should BELIEVE something after reading
      → Explore: the reader should UNDERSTAND something after reading

  Q3: How long?
      → Short (1,000-2,000 words): "Compressed"
      → Medium (3,000-5,000 words): "Standard"
      → Long (5,000-10,000 words): "Extended"
      → Very long (10,000+ words): "Comprehensive"

  Q4: Where will this be published?
      → Blog / newsletter: "Informal"
      → Magazine / edited publication: "Polished"
      → Academic journal / book: "Formal"
      → Internal document / report: "Functional"

  Record your four answers. You'll use them throughout.

================================================================

SECTION A: EXTRACT THE ESSAY'S CORE
------------------------------------

Step A1: FIND THE SINGLE MOST INTERESTING THING
  Action: Read through the entire DCP output. Ask yourself:
    "If I could only tell the reader ONE thing from this
     procedure, what would surprise or help them most?"

  This is usually found in one of three places:
    - The hidden assumptions (Step 3 of the DCP)
    - A non-obvious decision point in the procedure
    - A failure mode that contradicts common belief

  Write it down in one sentence. This is your THESIS.

  Test: Does your sentence make someone want to read more?
    YES → Continue to A2
    NO  → It's too obvious. Go deeper. What's the
          assumption BEHIND the obvious thing?

Step A2: SELECT YOUR NARRATIVE STRATEGY
  Action: Based on your answers from Step 0:

  If PURPOSE = Teach:
    → If AUDIENCE = General: Use STORY-FIRST
    → If AUDIENCE = Practitioner: Use PROBLEM-FIRST
    → If AUDIENCE = Expert: Use EXAMPLE-FIRST

  If PURPOSE = Persuade:
    → Use ARGUMENT-FIRST (lead with your thesis)

  If PURPOSE = Explore:
    → If the topic has strong conventional wisdom:
      Use CONTRAST-FIRST
    → If the topic is unfamiliar:
      Use PROBLEM-FIRST

Step A3: CHOOSE WHAT TO INCLUDE AND WHAT TO CUT
  Action: List every major element from the DCP output:
    - Each dimension from Step 1
    - Each assumption from Step 3
    - Each section of the procedure (Step 4)
    - Each failure mode from Step 5
    - Each worked example

  Now score each element (1-3):
    3 = Directly supports thesis, surprising, or essential
    2 = Useful context but not critical
    1 = Expected, obvious, or tangential

  Cutting rules by length:
    Compressed: Include only 3s. Maximum 3-5 elements.
    Standard: Include all 3s, select 2s. ~8-12 elements.
    Extended: Include all 3s and 2s. ~15-20 elements.
    Comprehensive: Include everything. Add context beyond
                   the procedure.

  What you should see: A shortlist of procedure elements
  that will appear in the essay, ordered by importance.

================================================================

SECTION B: BUILD THE ESSAY STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------

Step B1: WRITE THE OPENING (before anything else)
  Action: Your opening must do exactly two things:
    1. Connect to a problem the reader FEELS
    2. Promise that this essay will help

  Format by narrative strategy:

  STORY-FIRST opening:
    "[Person] was facing [specific version of the
     decision]. They did [common approach]. Here's
     what happened..." (2-4 paragraphs of scene-setting)

  PROBLEM-FIRST opening:
    "Most people approach [decision] by [common method].
     This fails because [reason]. There's a better way."
     (1-2 paragraphs)

  ARGUMENT-FIRST opening:
    "[Controversial claim from your thesis]." Then 1-2
    sentences of support. Then: "Here's why." (1 paragraph)

  EXAMPLE-FIRST opening:
    "Consider two approaches to [decision]..." Then show
    the naive approach and the procedure's approach
    side by side. (2-3 paragraphs)

  CONTRAST-FIRST opening:
    "The standard advice about [topic] is [conventional
     wisdom]. The problem is, it's wrong about [specific
     thing]." (1-2 paragraphs)

  Test: Read your opening aloud. Would you keep reading?
    YES → Continue to B2
    NO  → Rewrite. The opening is 50% of whether anyone
          reads the essay.

Step B2: MAP THE BODY STRUCTURE
  Action: Take your shortlisted elements from A3 and
  arrange them into sections.

  Use this template based on length:

  COMPRESSED (3-5 sections):
    1. Opening (from B1)
    2. The core insight (your thesis, expanded)
    3. The key steps (collapsed into principles)
    4. One vivid example
    5. Takeaway + "when this doesn't apply"

  STANDARD (5-8 sections):
    1. Opening (from B1)
    2. Why this matters / the problem
    3. What most people miss (hidden assumptions)
    4. The approach (procedure converted to prose)
    5. Example 1 (showing the approach working)
    6. Where it goes wrong (select failure modes)
    7. Example 2 (showing a failure mode)
    8. Conclusion + limits

  EXTENDED (8-12 sections):
    1. Opening
    2. The landscape (dimensions as context-setting)
    3. Why current approaches fail (assumptions)
    4-7. The approach (one section per major procedure
         branch, each with embedded examples)
    8. Where it breaks down (failure modes)
    9. What this means for [reader's domain]
    10. Limits and open questions
    11. Conclusion

  COMPREHENSIVE (12+ sections):
    All of EXTENDED plus:
    - Historical context
    - Competing approaches analyzed
    - Deep case studies (3+)
    - Original analysis
    - Appendix with the raw procedure

  For each section, write a ONE-SENTENCE summary of
  what that section accomplishes for the reader.

Step B3: CONVERT PROCEDURE ELEMENTS TO PROSE
  Action: For each procedure element in your outline,
  apply the appropriate conversion pattern:

  DECISION POINTS become narrative forks:
    Procedure: "Is X true? If yes, go to A. If no, go to B."
    Essay: "This is where [topic] splits into two very
    different problems. If you're dealing with [X], the
    approach is [A summary]. But if [not X], everything
    changes — you need [B summary]."

  STEP SEQUENCES become explanatory flow:
    Procedure: "Step 1: Do X. Step 2: Do Y. Step 3: Do Z."
    Essay: "Start with X — this establishes [why X matters].
    Once you have that, Y becomes possible because [logic].
    The final piece is Z, which [what Z accomplishes]."

  OPTION LISTS become comparisons:
    Procedure: "Option A / Option B / Option C"
    Essay: "You have three paths here. [A] works best when
    [condition]... [B] is the right choice if [condition]...
    Most people default to [C], but it's actually only
    appropriate when [narrow condition]."

  FAILURE MODES become warnings or stories:
    Procedure: "Failure: X happens when Y"
    Essay: "The most common way this goes wrong is [X].
    You'll recognize it when [symptoms]. The fix is
    [recovery action], but it's better to prevent it
    by [prevention]."

  ASSUMPTIONS become arguments:
    Procedure: "Hidden assumption: X"
    Essay: "There's an assumption buried in how most
    people approach this: [X]. It seems reasonable until
    you realize [why it's wrong]. The consequence is
    [what goes wrong]. Instead, [alternative]."

  WARNING: This is where most procedure-to-essay
  conversions fail. If you just put prose wrappers around
  procedure steps, you get a bad essay. Each element must
  EARN its place by telling the reader something they
  didn't know or connecting to something they care about.

================================================================

SECTION C: WRITE AND REVISE
-----------------------------

Step C1: WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT
  Action: Write the full draft following your outline
  from B2, using conversion patterns from B3.

  Rules:
  - Write the EXAMPLES first, then wrap the procedural
    content around them. Examples are the skeleton.
  - Do NOT look at the original procedure while writing
    prose sections. Write from understanding, not from
    copying.
  - Every paragraph must pass the "so what" test:
    if a reader asks "so what?" after reading it, the
    next sentence must answer that question.
  - If you get stuck on a section, skip it and write
    the next one. Fill gaps in revision.

  What you should see: A complete draft that reads
  more like an essay than a procedure, but probably
  still feels too mechanical in places.

Step C2: FIRST REVISION — STRUCTURE
  Action: Read the entire draft. For each section, ask:

  □ Does this section NEED to come before the next one?
    (If not, consider reordering)
  □ Can I cut this section without losing the argument?
    (If yes, cut it)
  □ Does the reader have enough context to understand
    this section when they reach it?
    (If not, add a bridge or move context earlier)
  □ Is there a transition between this section and
    the next? (If not, add one)
  □ Does this section end with forward momentum?
    (The reader should want to continue)

Step C3: SECOND REVISION — VOICE
  Action: Read the entire draft aloud. Mark every place
  where you:
  - Sound like a manual ("Step 1: First, ensure that...")
  - Use passive voice without reason ("It should be noted")
  - Hedge unnecessarily ("It might perhaps be useful to
    consider...")
  - State the obvious ("This is an important consideration")
  - Use filler ("In today's world...", "It goes without
    saying...")

  For each marked passage, rewrite in active, direct voice.

  Check by audience type:
  - General → Would you say this to a friend?
  - Practitioner → Would you say this to a colleague?
  - Expert → Would you say this to a peer reviewer?

  If FORMAT = Formal:
    → Check citation needs. Every factual claim needs
      a source or an explicit "in my analysis" framing.
  If FORMAT = Informal:
    → Check that the voice is consistent. Don't alternate
      between casual and academic.

Step C4: FINAL CHECK
  Action: Answer these questions about the finished essay:

  □ Does the opening make someone want to keep reading?
  □ Can I state the essay's main point in one sentence?
  □ Does every section contribute to that main point?
  □ Are the examples vivid and specific (not generic)?
  □ Does the ending give the reader something to DO
    or THINK about?
  □ Is there a "when this doesn't apply" section?
  □ Would I want to read this essay?

  If any answer is NO → fix that specific problem.

  → COMPLETE
```

## Step 5: Failure Modes

| # | Failure Mode | How to Recognize It | What to Do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The "decorated manual"** | The essay reads like a procedure with adjectives added. Every section starts with "The next step is..." or "It's important to..." | Go back to B3. You're converting syntax, not meaning. Rewrite from understanding without looking at the procedure |
| 2 | **The "everything bagel"** | The essay is exhaustive but exhausting. You included every dimension, every option, every failure mode | Go back to A3. You didn't cut enough. The essay should contain 30-60% of the procedure's content, not 100% |
| 3 | **The "missing examples"** | The essay explains the procedure abstractly but never shows it working on a real case | Write 2-3 detailed examples FIRST, then rebuild the essay around them. Examples aren't decoration — they're the primary vehicle for understanding |
| 4 | **The "buried lede"** | The most interesting insight is on page 4. The first two pages are throat-clearing context | Move your thesis to paragraph 1-2. Everything before the interesting part is a barrier to reading |
| 5 | **The "voice mismatch"** | Sections alternate between conversational and academic, or between first-person and third-person, or between confident and hedging | Pick one voice and enforce it in revision C3. Read the whole thing aloud — inconsistency is immediately audible |
| 6 | **The "false completeness"** | The essay covers the procedure completely but doesn't add anything the procedure didn't already say | The essay must add value: context, narrative, examples, connections, implications. If the procedure said it all, you need new material |
| 7 | **The "jargon leak"** | Domain terms from the procedure appear in the essay without explanation, alienating the target audience | Search for every technical term. If AUDIENCE = General, define or replace every one. If Practitioner, define the unusual ones. If Expert, define only novel terms |
| 8 | **The "no stakes"** | The essay explains what to do but never says why it matters, what goes wrong if you don't, or what's at stake | Add consequence framing: "If you skip this... / Without this... / The cost of getting this wrong is..." |

---

## Step 6: Validation Check

Reviewing every step for executability:

- **All steps are concrete actions**: "Write one sentence," "Score each element 1-3," "Read aloud and mark passages" — no "consider" or "reflect on"
- **All decision points are explicit**: Audience × Purpose → narrative strategy is a lookup table, not a judgment call
- **Conversion patterns are mechanical**: Each procedure element type maps to a specific prose pattern with templates
- **Every path terminates**: All branches lead to "COMPLETE" or redirect to a specific fix step
- **No expertise required**: Someone who has never written an essay from a procedure can follow this. The quality of the OUTPUT depends on writing skill, but the PROCESS is followable by anyone

**One gap**: Step C1 says "write from understanding" — this requires that the writer actually understands the procedure's domain. If they don't, the essay will be shallow. Mitigation: the procedure doesn't claim to make you a domain expert, only to structure the conversion process.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Following the procedure's order instead of the reader's needs.** The procedure starts with dimensions; the essay should start with whatever is most compelling
2. **Equal-weight treatment.** Giving 500 words to an obvious step and 500 words to a profound insight. Allocate space by insight density
3. **Skipping the cutting step.** The hardest part of this conversion is deciding what to leave out. If you include everything, you get a textbook, not an essay
4. **Writing prose that's really just bullets with conjunctions.** "First, you should X. Then, you should Y. Additionally, you should Z" is not an essay — it's a list with filler words
5. **No examples, or only generic examples.** "For instance, a company might..." is not a real example. Use specific, detailed, named cases
6. **Forgetting to add what the procedure doesn't contain.** The procedure has no stories, no history, no personal experience, no competing viewpoints. The essay needs these

## When to Override This Procedure

- **You're a skilled essayist** who can feel structure intuitively — use the procedure's content as raw material and write freely
- **The procedure is so simple** (3-4 steps, no branching) that a direct blog post format works without all this scaffolding
- **The essay's purpose is documentation**, not persuasion or teaching — in which case, keep the procedural format and just add context
- **You're converting to a different medium** (video script, presentation, podcast) — the prose conversion patterns don't apply; you need medium-specific patterns

---

*Validation status: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts. It synthesizes principles from nonfiction writing craft and editorial practice but should be tested on actual procedure-to-essay conversions before relying on it.*
