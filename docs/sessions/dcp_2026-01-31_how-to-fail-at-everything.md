# DCP — How to Fail at Everything (And How to Stop)

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: how to fail at everything

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

What dimensions determine whether someone is on a trajectory of universal failure?

| # | Dimension | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Feedback Responsiveness** | Do you notice and act on signals that something isn't working? | Failure persists when feedback is ignored, misread, or never sought. |
| 2 | **Locus of Attribution** | Do you attribute results to things you control or things you don't? | Blaming externals blocks learning. Over-blaming self blocks action. |
| 3 | **System vs. Goal Orientation** | Do you rely on motivation/goals, or on repeatable daily systems? | Goals without systems produce bursts then collapse. Systems compound. |
| 4 | **Energy Management** | Sleep, nutrition, exercise, substance use, recovery. | Low energy makes every domain fail simultaneously — it's the common cause. |
| 5 | **Selection Strategy** | How do you choose what to work on? | Working hard on the wrong things guarantees failure. Selection > effort. |
| 6 | **Iteration Speed** | How quickly do you try something, get feedback, and adjust? | Slow iterations mean slow learning. Fast iterations compound advantage. |
| 7 | **Skill Stacking** | Are you building complementary skills or scattered unrelated ones? | Two mediocre skills that combine are rarer and more valuable than one expert skill. |
| 8 | **Social Environment** | Who are you around? What norms do they set? | Environment determines default behavior more than willpower. |
| 9 | **Relationship with Risk** | Do you avoid all risk, take reckless risk, or take calculated asymmetric risk? | Universal failure often comes from either extreme — paralysis or ruin. |
| 10 | **Recovery Pattern** | What happens after a setback? Quit, spiral, or extract lesson and restart? | Failure at everything = failure to recover from individual failures. |
| 11 | **Time Horizon** | Are you optimizing for this week or this decade? | Short time horizons create choices that look good now but compound badly. |
| 12 | **Identity Flexibility** | Can you update who you think you are, or are you locked into a self-concept? | "I'm just not a [X] person" prevents entry into domains where you'd succeed. |

---

## Step 2: Option Space per Dimension (`/se`)

| Dimension | Failing State | Mediocre State | Succeeding State |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Feedback Responsiveness** | No feedback sought; signals actively avoided or explained away | Feedback received but not acted on; over-analyzing | Feedback sought, absorbed in days not months, drives next action |
| **Locus of Attribution** | "The world is against me" / "It's all my fault" (both extremes) | Vague sense of responsibility but no specifics | Specific: "I did X, it caused Y, next time I'll do Z" |
| **System vs. Goal** | "I want to be rich/fit/happy" with no daily actions | Has routines but they're not connected to outcomes | Daily systems that produce measurable progress without motivation |
| **Energy Management** | Chronic sleep debt, poor diet, no movement, substance reliance | Inconsistent; good weeks and bad weeks | Baseline habits protected: sleep 7+hrs, move daily, limit depressants |
| **Selection Strategy** | Works on whatever is in front of them; or chases every shiny object | Picks reasonable things but doesn't evaluate fit | Deliberately chooses domains with good personal fit + asymmetric upside |
| **Iteration Speed** | Spends months planning, never ships; or ships once and waits | Ships occasionally, reviews rarely | Weekly or faster cycles of try → measure → adjust |
| **Skill Stacking** | One narrow skill, or many scattered hobbies | Building skills but not combining them | 2-3 complementary skills that create rare combinations |
| **Social Environment** | Surrounded by people who normalize failure or punish ambition | Mixed; some supportive, some draining | Deliberately constructed; people who are where you want to be |
| **Risk Relationship** | Never bets (paralysis) OR bets everything on one shot (ruin) | Takes reasonable risks but doesn't size them | Asymmetric bets: limited downside, large upside; many small bets |
| **Recovery Pattern** | Quits after first failure; or spirals into extended inaction | Recovers eventually but loses months | Treats failure as data; restarts within days with adjustments |
| **Time Horizon** | Optimizing for today/this week | Thinks in months | Thinks in years/decades; accepts short-term costs for long-term gains |
| **Identity Flexibility** | "I am [fixed label]" — cannot imagine being different | Aware of possibility but uncomfortable changing | Treats identity as experiment: "I'm testing being someone who [X]" |

**Key interactions:**
- Low Energy → drags down ALL other dimensions simultaneously
- External Attribution + No Feedback = unbreakable failure loop
- Short Time Horizon + Goal-Only Orientation = chronic quitting

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

The conventional advice about "stop failing" assumes:

| # | Hidden Assumption | Why It's Dangerous |
|---|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **"You need more motivation"** | Motivation is an output of progress, not an input. Waiting for motivation guarantees inaction. |
| 2 | **"Find your passion first"** | Passion follows competence. You can't know what you love until you're good enough to experience the rewarding parts. |
| 3 | **"Work harder"** | Hard work on the wrong thing is the most common form of productive-feeling failure. Selection matters more than effort. |
| 4 | **"You need a better plan"** | Over-planning is procrastination wearing a suit. Most plans don't survive contact with reality. You need faster iterations, not better plans. |
| 5 | **"Failure is always a learning opportunity"** | Only if you extract the lesson. Unexamined failure just teaches learned helplessness. |
| 6 | **"Success requires sacrifice"** | Some sacrifice is real, but "sacrifice" often means neglecting energy management, which causes universal failure. |
| 7 | **"You should focus on one thing"** | True for execution windows. False for skill building — diversified skill stacks create more opportunities than single-track expertise. |
| 8 | **"Your environment doesn't matter that much"** | Environment is the strongest predictor of behavior. Willpower cannot sustainably override a hostile environment. |

## Step 4: The Procedure (`/stg`)

```
================================================================
FAILING AT EVERYTHING: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC & CORRECTION PROCEDURE
================================================================

STEP 0: TRIAGE — What kind of failure pattern are you in?

  Answer these three questions with YES or NO:

  Q1: Are you TIRED most of the time? (low energy, poor sleep,
      relying on caffeine/substances to function)
  Q2: Are you BUSY but not making PROGRESS? (lots of activity,
      nothing to show for it after 3 months)
  Q3: Are you NOT DOING MUCH AT ALL? (stuck, avoiding, withdrawn)

  If Q1 = YES → Go to SECTION A (Energy Crisis) FIRST.
                 Nothing else works until this is fixed.
  If Q1 = NO and Q2 = YES → Go to SECTION B (Selection Problem)
  If Q1 = NO and Q3 = YES → Go to SECTION C (Action Problem)
  If all NO → Go to SECTION D (Optimization)

================================================================
SECTION A: ENERGY CRISIS
================================================================

You cannot think clearly, decide well, or persist at anything
when your body is failing. This section comes first ALWAYS.

Step A1: SLEEP AUDIT
  Write down what time you went to bed and woke up for the last
  7 days (estimate from memory if needed).
  → Are you getting 7+ hours at least 5 of 7 nights?
    YES → Go to Step A2
    NO  → Your #1 priority is sleep. Do this:
          - Set a phone alarm for 1 hour before target bedtime
          - When it goes off, screens go away (non-negotiable)
          - Do this for 14 days before changing anything else
          - After 14 days, return to STEP 0 and re-triage
          STOP HERE until the 14 days pass.

Step A2: SUBSTANCE CHECK
  List every substance you use weekly: alcohol, cannabis,
  nicotine, caffeine after noon, anything else.
  → Are you using any depressant (alcohol, cannabis) more than
    2x per week?
    YES → Cut to max 1x/week for 30 days. This alone often
          fixes the "failing at everything" feeling.
          After 30 days, return to STEP 0.
    NO  → Go to Step A3

Step A3: MOVEMENT CHECK
  → Did you move your body (walk 20+ min, exercise, sport)
    at least 4 of the last 7 days?
    YES → Go to STEP 0, re-triage (energy likely not your
          main issue — recheck Q2 and Q3)
    NO  → Add a daily 20-minute walk. Not a gym routine.
          Not a program. A walk. Do this for 14 days.
          After 14 days, return to STEP 0.

================================================================
SECTION B: SELECTION PROBLEM
(You're busy but not progressing)
================================================================

Step B1: LIST YOUR ACTIVE PROJECTS
  Write down everything you're currently spending time on
  that you consider "productive" or "working toward something."
  Include jobs, side projects, learning, networking, etc.
  → How many items are on this list?
    1-2  → Go to Step B3 (right amount, wrong things)
    3-5  → Go to Step B2 (possibly too many)
    6+   → You have too many. Go to Step B2.

Step B2: FORCE-RANK AND CUT
  For each item, answer: "If I could only do ONE of these
  for the next 90 days, which would I choose?"
  Pick that one. Now pick a second.
  → Drop or pause everything else for 90 days.
  → You should now have 1-2 items. Go to Step B3.

Step B3: VALIDATE EACH REMAINING ITEM
  For each of your 1-2 items, answer ALL of these:
  a) Can you name a SPECIFIC person who has succeeded at this
     in the last 5 years starting from a similar position?
     NO → This might not be viable. Research for 2 hours
          (not 2 weeks). If you can't find one, switch domains.
  b) Have you received ANY positive signal in the last 90 days?
     (Someone paid you, someone praised specific work, metrics
     improved, you got a callback, etc.)
     NO → Go to Step B4
     YES → Go to Step B5
  c) Do you enjoy the DAILY WORK (not the imagined outcome)?
     NO → This is a fantasy, not a pursuit. Go to Step B4.
     YES → Go to Step B5

Step B4: PIVOT
  You're working on the wrong thing. This is the #1 cause of
  "failing at everything" — it feels like YOU are failing, but
  actually your SELECTION is failing.
  → List 5 domains where you have unusual interest, existing
    skill, or a connection to someone who's succeeding.
  → Pick the one with the fastest feedback loop (where you can
    try something and know within 1-2 weeks if it's working).
  → Do a 30-day test. Return to Step B3 after 30 days.

Step B5: INSTALL A SYSTEM
  You have the right thing. Now you need a system, not a goal.
  → Define the SMALLEST daily action that moves this forward.
    (Examples: write 200 words, make 1 sales call, code for
    30 minutes, practice 1 technique)
  → Do that action at the SAME TIME every day for 30 days.
  → Track with a physical calendar: X each day you do it.
  → After 30 days, assess: is the direction right? Adjust
    the daily action if needed. Never adjust before 30 days.
  → Go to SECTION D after 30 days.

================================================================
SECTION C: ACTION PROBLEM
(You're not doing much at all)
================================================================

Step C1: DEPRESSION SCREEN
  Answer honestly:
  → Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?
  → Do you feel hopeless about the future most days?
  → Has this lasted more than 2 weeks?
  If YES to all three:
  → This procedure cannot help you yet. See a doctor or
    therapist first. This is not weakness — it's a medical
    condition blocking your ability to act. STOP HERE.
    Come back when treatment has started.
  If NO to any → Go to Step C2

Step C2: FEAR IDENTIFICATION
  Complete this sentence 5 times with different endings:
  "I'm not doing [thing] because I'm afraid that ___________"
  → Read your 5 answers. What is the WORST REALISTIC outcome
    of actually trying?
    - Losing money you can't afford → Valid. Reduce the bet
      size until failure is affordable. Go to Step C3.
    - Embarrassment/judgment → Not valid as a reason to stop.
      Embarrassment is temporary. Go to Step C3.
    - Wasting time → You're wasting time NOW by not acting.
      Go to Step C3.
    - Something else → Write it down. Ask: "Will this matter
      in 5 years?" If no → Go to Step C3. If yes → reduce
      the bet size until it won't matter.

Step C3: THE 2-MINUTE START
  Pick ONE thing you've been avoiding.
  → Set a timer for 2 minutes.
  → Work on it for only 2 minutes. You have permission to
    stop after 2 minutes.
  → Did you stop at 2 minutes, or keep going?
    STOPPED → Do 2 minutes again tomorrow. And the next day.
              After 7 days of 2-minute sessions, increase to
              5 minutes. After another 7 days, 15 minutes.
              The goal is not output — it's rebuilding the
              action habit.
    KEPT GOING → The barrier was starting, not doing.
                 Install a daily "2-minute start" ritual at a
                 fixed time. Go to SECTION B Step B5.

================================================================
SECTION D: OPTIMIZATION
(Basics are handled — now improve trajectory)
================================================================

Step D1: FEEDBACK AUDIT
  → In the last 30 days, how many times has someone with
    MORE experience than you given you specific feedback on
    your work?
    0 times → This is your bottleneck. You're flying blind.
              Find one person ahead of you. Show them your
              work. Ask: "What's the biggest thing I'm getting
              wrong?" Do this within 7 days.
    1+ times → Go to Step D2

Step D2: ITERATION SPEED CHECK
  → How long is your cycle from "try something" to "know if
    it worked"?
    More than 1 month → Too slow. Find a way to get signal
                        within 1-2 weeks. Smaller experiments,
                        faster feedback. Redesign your approach
                        to shorten this cycle.
    1-4 weeks → Acceptable. Go to Step D3.
    Less than 1 week → Good. Go to Step D3.

Step D3: SKILL STACK ASSESSMENT
  → List your top 3 skills (things you're better at than
    75% of people you know).
  → Do any two of these COMBINE in a way that's unusual?
    (e.g., coding + writing, sales + technical knowledge,
    design + data analysis)
    YES → Double down on the combination. Your advantage is
          the intersection, not either skill alone.
    NO  → Pick one of your skills and ask: "What second
          skill would make this 10x more valuable?" Learn
          that skill to 70th percentile (not mastery — just
          competence). This typically takes 3-6 months of
          deliberate practice.

Step D4: ENVIRONMENT CHECK
  → Of the 5 people you spend the most time with, how many
    are actively building something or improving at something?
    0-1 → Your environment is holding you back. Find ONE
          community (online or local) of people doing what
          you want to do. Attend/participate weekly.
    2+  → Environment is adequate. Return to STEP 0 every
          90 days for re-triage.

================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
================================================================

THE FAILURE STACK (most common → least common cause):
  1. Energy crisis (sleep/substances/movement)
  2. Working on the wrong thing (selection)
  3. No system (relying on motivation)
  4. No feedback (flying blind)
  5. Slow iterations (can't learn fast enough)
  6. Wrong environment (norms pulling you down)
  7. Fear paralysis (not starting)
  8. Identity lock ("I'm not a ___ person")

THE FIX ORDER:
  Energy → Selection → System → Feedback → Speed → Environment

ONE-LINE VERSION:
  Sleep properly, pick one thing, do it daily, get feedback
  weekly, adjust monthly, surround yourself with builders.

================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES
================================================================

1. SKIPPING THE ENERGY SECTION. "That's not my problem."
   It almost always is. If you're failing at EVERYTHING
   (not just one thing), the common cause is physical.

2. TRYING TO FIX EVERYTHING AT ONCE. This procedure is
   sequential for a reason. Fix one layer, then the next.

3. CHANGING THE DAILY SYSTEM BEFORE 30 DAYS. The urge to
   tweak is procrastination in disguise. Stick with it.

4. SEEKING MORE INFORMATION INSTEAD OF ACTING. If you've
   been in "research mode" for more than 2 weeks on any
   decision, you're avoiding, not preparing.

5. COMPARING YOUR PROGRESS TO OTHERS' OUTCOMES. Compare
   your system adherence (did I do the daily thing?) not
   your results (am I where they are?).

6. BELIEVING "FAILING AT EVERYTHING" IS A PERMANENT TRAIT.
   It's a state, not an identity. States change when inputs
   change.

================================================================
WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE
================================================================

- If you have a diagnosed medical or psychiatric condition
  affecting function → Medical treatment first, always.
- If you're in an abusive relationship or unsafe living
  situation → Safety first. This procedure assumes baseline
  physical safety and autonomy.
- If you're in acute financial crisis (can't make rent) →
  Get any income source first, then optimize. Survival
  overrides optimization.
- If a qualified professional (therapist, doctor, financial
  advisor) gives you advice that contradicts this procedure →
  Follow the professional. This is a general-purpose tool,
  not expert advice.

================================================================
WORKED EXAMPLES
================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: "I keep starting businesses and they all fail"
  → STEP 0: Q1=NO, Q2=YES → SECTION B
  → B1: Lists 4 active "projects" → B2: Force-ranks, keeps 1
  → B3a: Can name someone similar who succeeded? YES
  → B3b: Any positive signal in 90 days? NO → B4: PIVOT
  → Lists 5 domains, picks freelance consulting (fast feedback)
  → 30-day test → returns to B3 with signal → B5: installs
    daily system of "reach out to 2 potential clients/day"

EXAMPLE 2: "I can't get myself to do anything"
  → STEP 0: Q1=YES → SECTION A
  → A1: Sleeping 5-6 hours → fixes sleep for 14 days
  → Re-triage: Q1=NO, Q3=YES → SECTION C
  → C1: Depression screen negative → C2: Fear = "wasting time"
  → C3: 2-minute start → kept going → installs daily ritual
  → Moves to SECTION B

EXAMPLE 3: "I work hard but nothing comes together"
  → STEP 0: Q1=NO, Q2=YES → SECTION B
  → B1: 2 projects → B3: Both have positive signal
  → B5: Installs daily system → 30 days pass → SECTION D
  → D1: 0 feedback in 30 days → finds mentor, gets feedback
  → D3: Skills don't combine → identifies complementary skill
  → D4: 0/5 people building → joins online community
```

Validation status: This procedure has not been validated by
domain experts. It synthesizes principles from Scott Adams
(systems vs goals, skill stacking), James Clear (habit
systems), and standard behavioral psychology (energy
management, feedback loops, iteration speed).
