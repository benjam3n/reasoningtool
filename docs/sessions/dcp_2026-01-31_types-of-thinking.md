# Decision Procedure — Types of Thinking and When to Use

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: different types of thinking and when to use

---

## Step 1: Dimension Discovery

### Seed Examples

1. Analytical thinking — breaking a problem into parts (debugging code)
2. Creative thinking — generating novel combinations (brainstorming product names)
3. Critical thinking — evaluating claims for truth (reading a news article)
4. Strategic thinking — choosing actions to reach goals (career planning)
5. Systems thinking — understanding interconnections (diagnosing why a team is slow)
6. Lateral thinking — approaching from unexpected angles (solving a stuck problem by reframing)
7. Metacognitive thinking — thinking about your own thinking (noticing you're biased)
8. Intuitive thinking — pattern-matching from experience (a doctor's "gut feeling")
9. Formal/logical thinking — following deductive rules (mathematical proof)
10. Empathic thinking — modeling another person's perspective (negotiation prep)

### Dimensions Discovered

| # | Dimension | Values | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | **Direction** | Convergent (narrowing to answer), Divergent (expanding possibilities), Integrative (combining both) | Determines whether you're opening up or closing down |
| 2 | **Speed** | Fast/automatic (System 1), Slow/deliberate (System 2), Oscillating (switching between) | Determines cognitive load and when to trust output |
| 3 | **Purpose** | Understand, Evaluate, Decide, Create, Communicate, Monitor | What you need at the end |
| 4 | **Domain** | Things/systems, People/minds, Abstract/formal, Self/meta | What you're thinking about |
| 5 | **Constraint relationship** | Works within rules, Works around rules, Creates new rules | How thinking relates to existing structure |
| 6 | **Input type** | Data/evidence, Patterns/experience, Models/theory, Feelings/values | What the thinking runs on |
| 7 | **Failure mode** | False precision, False novelty, False confidence, Analysis paralysis, Groupthink | What goes wrong when this type of thinking is misapplied |
| 8 | **Skill requirement** | Domain expertise needed, Trainable technique, Innate/developmental | Who can do this and how they learn it |

**Space size**: 3 × 3 × 6 × 4 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 3 = 19,440 combinations — but most are empty. The populated space is ~15-20 distinct thinking types.

---

## Step 2: Space Enumeration

### The Thinking Types

| # | Thinking Type | Direction | Speed | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|--------------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Analytical** | Convergent | Slow | Understand | You have something complex and need to know how it works |
| 2 | **Creative/Generative** | Divergent | Both | Create | You need options, ideas, or novel combinations |
| 3 | **Critical** | Convergent | Slow | Evaluate | Someone is claiming something and you need to know if it's true |
| 4 | **Strategic** | Convergent | Slow | Decide | You have a goal and limited resources |
| 5 | **Systems** | Integrative | Slow | Understand | Effects are surprising, things are interconnected, interventions backfire |
| 6 | **Lateral** | Divergent | Both | Create | You're stuck; conventional approaches aren't working |
| 7 | **Metacognitive** | Integrative | Slow | Monitor | You suspect your own thinking is flawed or you're going in circles |
| 8 | **Intuitive** | Convergent | Fast | Decide | High expertise + time pressure; pattern is familiar |
| 9 | **Formal/Logical** | Convergent | Slow | Evaluate | Precision matters; errors are costly; proof is needed |
| 10 | **Empathic** | Divergent | Both | Understand | You need to predict or influence human behavior |
| 11 | **Probabilistic** | Convergent | Slow | Evaluate | Uncertainty is high; you need to reason about likelihoods |
| 12 | **Counterfactual** | Divergent | Slow | Understand | You need to learn from what happened by imagining alternatives |
| 13 | **Adversarial** | Convergent | Slow | Evaluate | You need to find weaknesses before someone else does |
| 14 | **Analogical** | Divergent | Both | Create | You need to transfer solutions from one domain to another |
| 15 | **First-principles** | Convergent | Slow | Understand | Conventional wisdom may be wrong; you need to reason from base truths |

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It's Dangerous |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Pick one type and apply it" | Most real problems need 2-3 types in sequence. Picking only one is the most common mistake. |
| 2 | "Critical thinking is always appropriate" | Critical thinking applied too early kills creative ideas. Timing matters more than type. |
| 3 | "Intuition is unreliable" | In domains of high experience with regular feedback, intuition outperforms deliberate analysis. The question is whether YOUR domain qualifies. |
| 4 | "More rigorous = better" | Formal/logical thinking on a people problem is a category error. Rigor in the wrong dimension wastes effort. |
| 5 | "Thinking types are personality traits" | They're skills and modes, not identities. "I'm not a creative thinker" is almost always false — you haven't practiced creative thinking protocols. |
| 6 | "Metacognition is optional" | Without metacognition, you can't detect when you're using the wrong type. It's the only type that governs all others. |
| 7 | "The problem tells you which type to use" | Problems don't announce their type. The same situation might need analytical OR systems thinking depending on what's actually going on. You often need to try one and switch. |

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION A: I NEED TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step A1: Is the thing you're trying to understand a
         SINGLE THING or a SYSTEM of interacting parts?

  SINGLE THING (a function, a concept, a failure)
  → Use ANALYTICAL thinking.
     How: Break it into parts. Examine each part.
     Reassemble your understanding.
     Done when: You can explain it to someone else
     and predict what it will do in new situations.

  SYSTEM (a team, a market, an ecosystem, a codebase)
  → Use SYSTEMS thinking.
     How: Map the parts AND their connections.
     Look for feedback loops (A causes B causes more A).
     Look for delays (A causes B, but not until later).
     Look for unintended consequences.
     Done when: You can explain why interventions
     have historically failed or produced surprises.

Step A2: Is the conventional explanation possibly wrong?

  YES or UNSURE
  → Add FIRST-PRINCIPLES thinking.
     How: List every assumption in the current explanation.
     For each: "Is this actually true, or is it inherited
     wisdom?" Rebuild understanding from only the
     assumptions that survive.

  NO (conventional explanation is solid)
  → Stay with analytical or systems thinking from A1.

Step A3: Would understanding WHY something DIDN'T happen
         help you understand why it DID?

  YES → Add COUNTERFACTUAL thinking.
     How: "If X had been different, what would have
     changed?" Work through 2-3 alternative scenarios.
     The differences reveal what actually mattered.

  NO → You're done. Apply the thinking type(s) from above.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION B: I NEED TO EVALUATE SOMETHING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step B1: What kind of claim are you evaluating?

  FACTUAL ("Is X true?")
  → Use CRITICAL thinking.
     How: What's the evidence? What's the source?
     What would make this false? Is there counter-evidence?
     Done when: You have a verdict with stated confidence.

  LOGICAL ("Does X follow from Y?")
  → Use FORMAL/LOGICAL thinking.
     How: State the premises explicitly. Check each
     inference step. Look for hidden premises.
     Does the conclusion actually follow?
     Done when: You've identified valid or invalid
     and can point to the specific step.

  PROBABILISTIC ("How likely is X?")
  → Use PROBABILISTIC thinking.
     How: What's the base rate? What evidence updates it?
     Are you confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)?
     What's the range of outcomes, not just the expected one?
     Done when: You have a probability range, not a point
     estimate, and you've checked for base rate neglect.

Step B2: Do you need to find weaknesses specifically?

  YES → Add ADVERSARIAL thinking.
     How: "If I were trying to break/exploit/defeat this,
     what would I do?" Steelman the opposition.
     Test every load-bearing assumption.

  NO → Apply the thinking type from B1.

Step B3: CHECK — Are you evaluating something you created?

  YES → WARNING: Switch to adversarial thinking.
     You are biased toward your own work. You cannot
     critically evaluate your own output without
     deliberately trying to break it.

  NO → Proceed normally.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION C: I NEED TO DECIDE SOMETHING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step C1: How much time do you have?

  SECONDS TO MINUTES (and you have deep domain experience)
  → Use INTUITIVE thinking.
     How: Go with your trained gut. Don't override it
     with analysis unless something feels specifically wrong.
     WARNING: Only valid if you have 10,000+ hours in
     this exact type of decision with regular feedback.
     If not, go to "hours or more."

  HOURS OR MORE
  → Use STRATEGIC thinking.
     How: Define the goal. List options. For each option:
     What's the expected outcome? What's the downside?
     What's irreversible? Choose the option with the best
     ratio of upside to irreversible downside.

Step C2: Is uncertainty the main problem?

  YES (you don't know what will happen)
  → Add PROBABILISTIC thinking.
     How: For each option, estimate the range of outcomes
     (not just the best case). Weight by likelihood.
     Consider: what happens if you're wrong?

  NO (you know what will happen, you just can't choose)
  → The problem is probably VALUES, not thinking.
     Ask: "What matters more to me?" That's a different
     question than "What will happen?"

Step C3: Is this decision reversible?

  YES → Decide faster. Use 70% confidence threshold.
     You can correct course later. The cost of delay
     exceeds the cost of being wrong.

  NO → Decide slower. Use adversarial thinking (Section B,
     Step B2) on your leading option before committing.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION D: I NEED TO CREATE SOMETHING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step D1: Do you have ideas already?

  NO (blank slate)
  → Use CREATIVE/GENERATIVE thinking FIRST.
     How: Quantity over quality. Generate 20+ ideas
     without filtering. No criticism allowed yet.
     Use random inputs, constraints, or prompts to
     force novelty.
     THEN → Go to D2.

  YES (but they feel stale or obvious)
  → Use LATERAL thinking.
     How: Deliberately break your assumptions.
     "What if the opposite were true?"
     "What would [person from different field] do?"
     "What if the constraint didn't exist?"
     THEN → Go to D2.

  YES (and they feel promising)
  → Go to D2 directly.

Step D2: Do you need to combine ideas from different fields?

  YES → Use ANALOGICAL thinking.
     How: "What problem in [other domain] is structurally
     similar to mine? How did they solve it?"
     Map the solution back to your domain.
     Check: does the analogy hold, or did you force it?

  NO → Go to D3.

Step D3: Time to switch modes.

  STOP generating. START evaluating.
  → Go to SECTION B to evaluate your best ideas.

  WARNING: The #1 creative failure is never switching
  from divergent to convergent. Ideas without evaluation
  are just lists.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION E: I'M STUCK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step E1: Do you know WHY you're stuck?

  NO → Use METACOGNITIVE thinking FIRST.
     How: Stop working on the problem. Work on your
     thinking instead.
     Ask: "What type of thinking have I been using?"
     Ask: "What assumption am I making that I haven't
     questioned?"
     Ask: "Am I stuck on the PROBLEM or on my APPROACH
     to the problem?"
     Once you know why → continue to E2.

  YES → Go to E2.

Step E2: What kind of stuck?

  "I've tried everything and nothing works"
  → Use LATERAL thinking.
     How: You haven't tried everything. You've tried
     everything WITHIN YOUR CURRENT FRAME.
     Change the frame:
     - Redefine the problem
     - Remove a constraint you assumed was fixed
     - Solve a DIFFERENT problem that makes this one
       irrelevant

  "I have too many options and can't choose"
  → Use ANALYTICAL thinking to reduce options, then
     STRATEGIC thinking to choose. (Sections A then C.)

  "I keep going in circles"
  → Use FIRST-PRINCIPLES thinking.
     You're looping because you're reasoning from
     the same assumptions. Go deeper. Find the
     assumptions and question them.

  "I don't even know what I'm trying to do"
  → Step away from thinking types entirely.
     Your problem is GOAL CLARITY, not thinking method.
     Define what success looks like first.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION F: I NEED TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step F1: What do you need?

  UNDERSTAND what someone is thinking/feeling
  → Use EMPATHIC thinking.
     How: "If I were them, with their history, their
     constraints, their incentives — what would I
     think/feel/do?" NOT "what would I do in their
     situation" (that's still YOUR perspective).

  PREDICT what someone will do
  → Use EMPATHIC thinking + STRATEGIC thinking.
     How: Model their goals, constraints, and information.
     Then: "Given those, what's their best move?"

  PERSUADE or INFLUENCE
  → Use EMPATHIC thinking FIRST (understand their frame)
     Then STRATEGIC thinking (what argument or action
     would shift them, given their frame?)
     WARNING: If you skip empathic thinking, your
     persuasion will be based on YOUR values, not theirs,
     and will fail.

  RESOLVE CONFLICT
  → Use SYSTEMS thinking.
     How: Map the system that's creating the conflict.
     Who has what incentives? What feedback loops maintain
     the conflict? Where is the leverage point?
     Often: the conflict is structural, not personal.
```

## Step 5: Failure Modes

| # | Failure Mode | How to Recognize | What to Do |
|---|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Hammer syndrome** — using your favorite thinking type for everything | Every problem gets the same approach. A programmer analyzes feelings. A therapist empathizes with code. | Step 0 exists to prevent this. If you catch yourself skipping Step 0, stop and restart. |
| 2 | **Never switching** — starting with one type and never transitioning | You've been analyzing for hours and haven't generated a single option. Or you've been brainstorming for hours and haven't evaluated anything. | Set a timer. After 30 minutes, ask: "Should I be in a different mode now?" |
| 3 | **Critical too early** — evaluating ideas before you have enough | You shot down the first 3 ideas and stopped generating. | Rule: Generate 10+ before evaluating ANY. Section D enforces this. |
| 4 | **Intuition without expertise** — trusting your gut in an unfamiliar domain | You're making fast decisions in a new field. Your "intuition" is actually just your first guess. | Step C1 has the 10,000-hour gate. If you don't meet it, slow down. |
| 5 | **Skipping metacognition** — never checking if you're using the right type | You spent 4 hours on the wrong approach and only realized at the end. | Section E, Step E1. Make metacognitive check-ins a habit, not a last resort. |
| 6 | **Analysis paralysis** — using analytical/critical thinking to avoid deciding | You keep finding more things to analyze. The analysis is a delay tactic. | Step C3: Is the decision reversible? If yes, use 70% threshold and go. |
| 7 | **Empathy without strategy** — understanding everyone's perspective but never acting | You understand why everyone feels the way they do, but nothing changes. | Section F requires pairing empathic with strategic. Understanding alone doesn't solve. |
| 8 | **Systems thinking as avoidance** — "it's all connected" as excuse for inaction | Your systems map is beautiful. You haven't done anything with it. | Systems thinking must produce leverage points. If your map doesn't identify where to intervene, it's not done. |

---

## Step 6: Validation

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| Can someone with no background in cognitive science follow this? | Yes — no jargon unexplained; every type defined by what you DO, not what it IS |
| Are all decision points clear? | Yes — Step 0 is 6-way with observable criteria; all sub-steps are binary or small multiple-choice |
| Does every path terminate? | Yes — every section ends with a concrete thinking type to apply |
| Are there loops? | One intentional one: Section D sends you to Section B for evaluation. This is correct behavior, not a bug. Section E may send you back to other sections after diagnosis — also correct. |
| Does the procedure handle transitions? | Yes — multiple sections explicitly say "THEN switch to..." |
| Are failure modes actionable? | Yes — each has a recognition pattern and a concrete response |

## Quick Reference Card

```
Need to...        → Start with         → Then switch to
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Understand         Analytical/Systems    First-principles if stuck
Evaluate truth     Critical              Adversarial to stress-test
Evaluate risk      Probabilistic         Adversarial for worst case
Decide (fast)      Intuitive             (only if expert)
Decide (slow)      Strategic             Probabilistic if uncertain
Generate ideas     Creative/Lateral      Analytical to filter
Solve novel prob   First-principles      Creative for solutions
Deal with people   Empathic              Strategic to act
Debug thinking     Metacognitive         (then whatever it says)
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Treating thinking types as identities** ("I'm an analytical thinker"). They're tools. Use the right one for the job, not the one that feels like you.
2. **Only using one type per problem**. Most real problems need a sequence: understand → generate → evaluate → decide. That's 3-4 types minimum.
3. **Evaluating too early**. Critical thinking applied to raw ideas kills them. Generate first, evaluate second.
4. **Never evaluating**. Divergent thinking without convergent thinking produces lists, not solutions.
5. **Trusting intuition in new domains**. Intuitive thinking is pattern matching. In new domains, you don't have patterns. Slow down.

## When to Override This Procedure

- **Life-threatening emergency**: Act on intuition and training. This procedure is for non-emergency situations.
- **You have deep domain expertise AND this is a familiar decision type**: Your trained intuition may outperform a procedure. The procedure is most valuable when you're outside your expertise.
- **The problem is emotional, not cognitive**: If the real issue is fear, grief, anger, or motivation — thinking types won't fix it. Address the emotion first.

**Validation status**: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts.
