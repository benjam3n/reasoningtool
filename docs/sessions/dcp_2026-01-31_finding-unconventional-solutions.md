# FINDING UNCONVENTIONAL SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS — Decision Procedure

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

What factors determine whether you need an unconventional solution and which type to pursue?

**Dimension 1: Problem Maturity**
Has this problem been worked on before? A well-studied problem with known solutions that don't work requires different unconventional thinking than a novel problem nobody has framed yet.

**Dimension 2: Constraint Type**
What's actually blocking the obvious solutions? Resource constraints (not enough money/time)? Physical constraints (laws of nature)? Social constraints (people won't cooperate)? Knowledge constraints (don't know how)? The constraint type determines which unconventional moves are available.

**Dimension 3: Solution Space Explored**
How much of the conventional solution space has been tried? If you've tried one thing and it failed, you probably don't need unconventional thinking yet. If you've tried everything experts recommend, you do.

**Dimension 4: Reframe-ability**
Is the problem statement itself questionable? Sometimes the unconventional move is solving a different problem entirely. "How do I make this meeting productive?" vs. "Do we need this meeting?"

**Dimension 5: Stakeholder Flexibility**
How open are the people involved to unusual approaches? A team that punishes failure needs different unconventional strategies than one that rewards experimentation.

**Dimension 6: Reversibility Tolerance**
Can you try something and undo it if it fails? High reversibility = try weird things fast. Low reversibility = need unconventional thinking in the analysis phase, not the action phase.

**Dimension 7: Domain Transfer Potential**
Has this type of problem been solved in a different field? Most "unconventional" solutions are conventional solutions from somewhere else applied in a new context.

**Dimension 8: Assumption Density**
How many unstated assumptions constrain the current approach? More hidden assumptions = more opportunity for unconventional breakthroughs by violating them.

**Dimension 9: Time Pressure**
How urgently is a solution needed? High urgency favors borrowing unconventional solutions that worked elsewhere. Low urgency allows generating genuinely novel approaches.

**Dimension 10: Success Criteria Flexibility**
Can you redefine what "solved" means? Sometimes unconventional means accepting a partial solution, a different form of the outcome, or solving 80% of the problem by redefining the other 20% as acceptable.

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

| Dimension | Options |
|---|---|
| **Problem Maturity** | (A) Novel — nobody's framed this before, (B) Known but unsolved — active research/attempts, (C) Known with failed solutions — experts have tried and failed, (D) "Solved" but solution doesn't work for you |
| **Constraint Type** | (A) Resources (money, time, people), (B) Physics/nature, (C) Social/political (people won't cooperate), (D) Knowledge (don't know how), (E) Regulatory/legal, (F) Multiple interacting constraints |
| **Solution Space Explored** | (A) Barely tried anything yet, (B) Tried obvious approaches, (C) Tried expert-recommended approaches, (D) Exhausted known approaches |
| **Reframe-ability** | (A) Problem statement is given/fixed, (B) Problem statement is negotiable, (C) Problem statement is likely wrong |
| **Stakeholder Flexibility** | (A) Very conservative — failure is punished, (B) Moderate — open to ideas with evidence, (C) High — actively seeking novel approaches |
| **Reversibility** | (A) Fully reversible — can try and undo, (B) Partially reversible — some cost to undo, (C) Irreversible — one shot |
| **Domain Transfer** | (A) Problem is domain-specific, (B) Problem has analogues in other fields, (C) Problem is universal (every field faces it) |
| **Assumption Density** | (A) Few assumptions — problem is well-characterized, (B) Moderate — some hidden assumptions likely, (C) High — "everyone knows" things that may be wrong |
| **Time Pressure** | (A) Urgent — need something this week, (B) Moderate — weeks to months, (C) Low — can take time to explore |
| **Success Criteria** | (A) Fixed — must achieve exact outcome, (B) Flexible — outcome is negotiable, (C) Undefined — "I'll know it when I see it" |

**Key Interactions:**
- If Solution Space = "barely tried anything" → you probably don't need unconventional solutions yet. Try conventional first.
- If Reversibility = high + Stakeholder Flexibility = high → just try weird things rapidly. The procedure below is overkill.
- If Constraint Type = physics/nature → domain transfer and assumption-challenging are your best bets. Social strategies won't help.
- If Reframe-ability = "likely wrong" → skip solution generation entirely and go straight to reframing.

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions in Standard Problem-Solving

1. **"The problem is correctly stated."** Most people spend 95% of effort on solutions and 5% on problem definition. Unconventional solutions often come from restating the problem.

2. **"Solutions must be novel to be unconventional."** Most unconventional solutions are well-known in another context. Borrowing is underrated; inventing is overrated.

3. **"Expertise helps."** Domain experts are often the WORST at finding unconventional solutions because they've internalized the field's assumptions. Outsiders and beginners see options experts have learned to ignore.

4. **"More information leads to better solutions."** Sometimes less information forces creative constraint. The person who doesn't know it's "impossible" tries it and succeeds.

5. **"The solution should be proportional to the problem."** Big problems can have small solutions. A one-line code change can fix a system-wide bug. A single conversation can resolve a years-long conflict.

6. **"Unconventional = risky."** Many unconventional solutions are actually lower risk because they sidestep the problem rather than confronting it head-on.

7. **"You need to understand the problem fully before solving it."** Sometimes acting reveals information that analysis cannot. Prototype first, understand later.

8. **"The solution must address the root cause."** Sometimes treating symptoms is smarter. If the root cause is expensive or impossible to fix, a robust workaround IS the unconventional solution.

## Step 4: The Procedure

```
FINDING UNCONVENTIONAL SOLUTIONS — PROCEDURE
==============================================

STEP 0: Do you actually need an unconventional solution?

  Answer these two questions:

  Q1: Have you tried at least 3 different conventional
      approaches?
      - No → STOP. Try conventional approaches first.
        You're skipping ahead.
      - Yes → Continue.

  Q2: Can you clearly state why each conventional approach
      failed?
      - No → STOP. Go back and figure out WHY they failed.
        The failure pattern is your best clue.
      - Yes → Go to STEP 1.


STEP 1: Classify your situation.

  Look at your failed conventional approaches. What pattern
  do the failures share?

  (a) "We can't afford/don't have enough resources for any
       solution" → SECTION A (Constraint Inversion)
  (b) "Every solution we try creates a new problem"
       → SECTION B (Problem Reframe)
  (c) "We know what would work but can't get people to do it"
       → SECTION C (Path of Least Resistance)
  (d) "Nothing we try makes any difference at all"
       → SECTION D (Assumption Audit)
  (e) "We can't figure out what would even work"
       → SECTION E (Domain Transfer)
  (f) Multiple patterns / not sure
       → Start with SECTION D, then try others.


SECTION A: Constraint Inversion
---------------------------------
Use when: The obvious solutions exist but you can't afford
them or don't have the resources.

Step A1: Write down the constraint that blocks you.
  Be specific: "We have $5,000 but need $50,000" not
  "we don't have enough money."
  → What you should see: A specific gap between what you
    have and what you need.

Step A2: Ask — "What if this constraint were actually an
  advantage?"

  Write down at least 3 ways the constraint could be
  beneficial:

  Examples:
  - "We only have 2 people" → "We can make decisions in
     5 minutes instead of 5 meetings"
  - "We have no budget" → "We can't waste money on the
     wrong solution; forced to validate before spending"
  - "We have no brand recognition" → "We have no
     reputation to protect; can take risks others can't"

  → What you should see: 3 statements that are genuinely
    true (not forced optimism), where the constraint
    enables something.

Step A3: For each advantage from A2, ask: "What solution
  becomes possible ONLY because of this constraint?"

  → What you should see: Solutions that a well-resourced
    competitor literally cannot do.

Step A4: Pick the most promising solution from A3.
  Test: "Would I still choose this approach even if the
  constraint were removed?"
  - Yes → You've found something genuinely good, not just
    a workaround. Pursue it.
  - No → It's a workaround. That's fine — pursue it, but
    keep looking for something better.

Step A5: If none of the A3 solutions work, try SUBTRACTION.
  List everything currently part of the problem/project.
  Remove items one at a time and ask: "Does the core
  problem still exist without this element?"
  - If removing an element eliminates the problem → that
    element IS the problem. Solve by removal.
  - If removing an element doesn't matter → you were
    wasting resources on it. Cut it, redirect resources.

  → What you should see: A simpler version of the problem
    that fits your actual constraints.


SECTION B: Problem Reframe
----------------------------
Use when: Every solution creates a new problem. You're
playing whack-a-mole.

Step B1: Write the problem as you currently understand it.
  One sentence only.

Step B2: Identify WHO defined this problem.
  (a) You defined it yourself → Go to B3
  (b) A boss/client/stakeholder defined it → Go to B3
  (c) "Everyone knows" this is the problem → Go to B3
  (d) The problem "just is" / it's obvious → WARNING.
      "Obvious" problems are the most likely to be
      misframed. Go to B3 with extra suspicion.

Step B3: Rewrite the problem 5 different ways.

  Use these templates:

  1. REVERSE IT: Instead of "How do I get X?" ask
     "How do I make X unnecessary?"

  2. WIDEN IT: Instead of the specific problem, what's the
     BROADER goal? "Fix this bug" → "Make the system
     reliable" → maybe reliability comes from redundancy,
     not bug-fixing.

  3. NARROW IT: Instead of the general problem, what's the
     SPECIFIC painful moment? "Team communication is bad" →
     "On Mondays, nobody knows what happened Friday" →
     maybe you just need a Friday summary.

  4. FLIP THE SUBJECT: Instead of "How do I change X?" ask
     "How do I change my relationship to X?"
     "How do I reduce noise?" → "How do I make noise
     irrelevant?" (noise-canceling headphones don't reduce
     noise, they make it irrelevant.)

  5. QUESTION THE GOAL: "Why do I want X solved?" Follow
     the chain 3 levels deep. The real goal is usually 2-3
     levels up.

  → What you should see: 5 different problem statements,
    at least 2 of which feel uncomfortable or surprising.

Step B4: For each reframe, ask: "Is there an obvious
  solution to THIS version of the problem?"
  - Yes → You've found your unconventional solution. It
    was conventional all along, just applied to the wrong
    problem statement.
  - No for all 5 → Go to SECTION D.


SECTION C: Path of Least Resistance
--------------------------------------
Use when: You know what would work but can't get people
to do it.

Step C1: Write down the solution that would work if
  people cooperated.

Step C2: List every person/group who needs to act
  differently for this solution to work.

Step C3: For each person/group, answer: "What are they
  currently doing instead, and why does it make sense
  FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE?"

  → What you should see: Rational reasons for their
    current behavior. If you can't see rational reasons,
    you don't understand the situation well enough.
    Go talk to them before continuing.

Step C4: For each person/group, find the PATH OF LEAST
  RESISTANCE:
  "What is the smallest change to their environment that
  would make the desired behavior EASIER than the current
  behavior?"

  Not: convince them, incentivize them, punish them.
  Instead: make the new way the lazy way.

  Examples:
  - People don't file reports → make the tool auto-generate
    reports from existing data
  - People eat unhealthy food → put healthy food at eye
    level, unhealthy food requires a step stool
  - People don't exercise → put the gym between the
    parking lot and the office door

  → What you should see: Environmental changes, not
    motivational changes.

Step C5: For each environmental change from C4, check:
  "Can I make this change without anyone's permission?"
  - Yes → Do it. Don't ask. Don't announce. Just change
    the environment and see what happens.
  - No → Who has permission? What do THEY want? Find a
    version of the change that gives the permission-holder
    something they want.

Step C6: If no environmental change works, try ROUTING
  AROUND.
  "Can I achieve the same goal without needing these
  people to change at all?"
  - Different people who would cooperate?
  - A technical solution that replaces the human process?
  - A way to make the problem irrelevant to them?

  → What you should see: A path that avoids the
    cooperation problem entirely.


SECTION D: Assumption Audit
-----------------------------
Use when: Nothing you try makes any difference. You're
stuck and don't know why.

Step D1: Write down everything you "know" about this
  problem. Every fact, every constraint, every rule.
  Target: 10-20 statements.
  → What you should see: A list of declarative statements
    like "Users won't pay more than $10" or "The database
    can't handle more than 1000 requests/sec."

Step D2: For EACH statement, classify it:
  [M] = Measured. You have data proving this.
  [T] = Told. Someone told you this, but you haven't
        verified it.
  [A] = Assumed. You believe this but have no evidence.
  [O] = Obvious. "Everyone knows" this.

  → What you should see: At least 30% of your statements
    are [T], [A], or [O]. If everything is [M], you're
    being dishonest with yourself — go back and look harder.

Step D3: Take every [T], [A], and [O] statement. For
  each one, write: "What would I do differently if this
  were FALSE?"

  - If the answer is "nothing changes" → not a leverage
    point. Skip it.
  - If the answer is "everything changes" → this is a
    HIGH-LEVERAGE ASSUMPTION. Star it.

Step D4: For each starred assumption, determine the
  cheapest way to TEST it.

  Not prove — test. What's the fastest, cheapest
  experiment that would give evidence for or against?

  - "Users won't pay more than $10" → raise the price
    for 100 users and measure.
  - "The database can't handle 1000 req/sec" → actually
    benchmark it.
  - "Management will never approve this" → ask one
    manager informally.

  → What you should see: A test for each starred
    assumption that costs less than 1% of your total
    budget/time.

Step D5: Run the tests. Start with the assumption you're
  MOST certain about — that's the one most likely to
  surprise you.

Step D6: For each assumption that turns out to be FALSE:
  The unconventional solution is whatever becomes possible
  now that the assumption is removed.

  → If all assumptions hold up: Go to SECTION E.


SECTION E: Domain Transfer
-----------------------------
Use when: You can't figure out what would even work.
You've never seen this type of problem solved.

Step E1: Describe your problem in ABSTRACT terms.
  Strip away all domain-specific language.

  "Our SaaS product has high churn after the trial period"
  → "People try something free, like it enough to start,
     but don't value it enough to pay."

  "Our bridge keeps cracking under load"
  → "A structure fails when stress exceeds its capacity
     at specific points."

  → What you should see: A description that someone from
    ANY field could understand.

Step E2: List 5 DIFFERENT fields where this abstract
  problem exists. Force diversity — don't list 5 types
  of engineering.

  Use this category list to force breadth:
  - Nature/biology
  - Military/strategy
  - Psychology/behavior
  - Art/music/design
  - Economics/markets
  - Medicine/health
  - Sports/games
  - Education/learning
  - Construction/architecture
  - Cooking/chemistry

  → What you should see: 5 fields, each from a different
    category above.

Step E3: For each field, search (web, books, experts,
  AI) for: "How does [field] handle [abstract problem]?"

  Write down the approach, even if it seems irrelevant
  to your domain.

Step E4: For each approach found, TRANSLATE it back to
  your domain:
  "If I applied [field's approach] to my problem, it
  would mean [specific concrete action]."

  Examples:
  - Biology handles "structure fails under stress" with
    redundancy and self-repair → "Build 3 smaller bridges
    instead of 1 big one, with sensors that trigger repair"
  - Cooking handles "people try but don't pay" with
    samples that create craving → "Make the trial give
    a taste of the premium feature, not full access"

  → What you should see: 5 concrete approaches, at least
    2 of which feel novel in your domain.

Step E5: Pick the most promising translated approach.
  "Most promising" = the one where you can test it
  cheapest and fastest, NOT the one that sounds best.

Step E6: If none of the translations work, try the
  OPPOSITE search. Instead of "how do other fields
  solve this," search for:
  "What fields have ELIMINATED this problem entirely —
  where does this problem not exist, and why?"

  → The absence of the problem is often more informative
    than solutions to it.

CARD 3: RED FLAGS YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG
  - "We need to think outside the box" but haven't
    mapped what's inside the box → Do Step 0 first
  - Brainstorming sessions → these produce quantity,
    not unconventionality
  - "What would X do?" without understanding X's
    constraints → Section E done wrong
  - Excitement about a solution before testing
    assumptions → Section D skipped
```

---

## Step 5: Failure Modes

**FAILURE 1: "Unconventional for its own sake."**
Symptom: You pursue novel solutions when conventional ones would work fine.
Recognition: You skipped Step 0. You haven't actually tried 3 conventional approaches.
Fix: Go back to Step 0. Unconventional solutions are a last resort, not a first instinct. Conventional solutions are conventional because they often work.

**FAILURE 2: "The brainstorm trap."**
Symptom: You generate 50 wild ideas, none of them actionable.
Recognition: Your ideas are verbs without nouns — "leverage synergies," "disrupt the space," "think differently."
Fix: Every idea must be a specific, testable action. "Call 10 customers and ask why they left" not "understand customer needs better."

**FAILURE 3: "Analogies without translation."**
Symptom: You found a great analogy from another field but can't make it concrete.
Recognition: You're stuck at Section E Step E3 — you have the analogy but E4 (translation) produces gibberish.
Fix: The analogy is too abstract. Go back to E1 and make your abstract description more specific. "Structure fails under stress" is too vague — "rigid structure fails when dynamic load exceeds static design tolerance" translates much better.

**FAILURE 4: "Challenging the wrong assumptions."**
Symptom: You tested assumptions but nothing changed.
Recognition: All your starred assumptions in D3 turned out to be true.
Fix: You classified too many things as [M] (measured) in D2. Go back and be more honest — when was the data collected? Has anything changed? Is the measurement actually measuring what you think?

**FAILURE 5: "The permission trap."**
Symptom: Every unconventional solution requires someone's approval, and you can't get it.
Recognition: Step C5 produces "No" for everything.
Fix: You're solving the wrong problem. The real problem is your authority/autonomy, not the original problem. Either solve THAT first, or find solutions that don't require permission — which often means doing something smaller.

**FAILURE 6: "Reframing into a harder problem."**
Symptom: Your reframes in Section B make the problem bigger, not more solvable.
Recognition: All 5 reframes in B3 feel even more overwhelming than the original.
Fix: Use only template #3 (NARROW IT) repeatedly. Keep narrowing until you find the smallest version of the problem. Solve that. Then expand.

## Step 6: Validation Check

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Can someone with no problem-solving training follow this? | Yes — all steps are write/list/answer/test actions |
| Are all decision points explicit? | Yes — Step 0 is Yes/No, Step 1 is (a)-(f), all sections have concrete routing |
| Does every path lead to an output? | Yes — each section ends with a testable solution or redirects to another section |
| Are there dead ends? | No — D6 routes to E, E6 is a final fallback, B4 routes to D |
| Is "use your judgment" avoided? | Yes — closest is "most promising" in E5, which is defined as "cheapest to test" |
| Loops? | Section routing can cycle (D→E, B→D) but never the same section twice without new information |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Constraint Inversion (Section A)

**Problem**: "We need to hire 5 engineers but can only afford 1."

Step A1: Constraint = "budget for 1 engineer, work requiring 5."

Step A2: Advantages of having only 1 engineer:
1. One person makes all architecture decisions — no design-by-committee
2. Forced to build only what's essential — no feature bloat
3. Can hire the best single person instead of 5 mediocre ones

Step A3: Solutions enabled by constraint:
1. Hire one senior architect who designs a system simple enough for 1 person to maintain
2. Build only the 20% of features that drive 80% of value
3. Use no-code/low-code for everything except the core differentiator

Step A4: "Would I still choose #2 even with 5 engineers?" — Actually, yes. The constraint forced clarity about what matters.

**Output**: Build only the core 20%. The "hiring problem" was actually a "scope problem."

### Example 2: Domain Transfer (Section E)

**Problem**: "Meeting attendance is mandatory but most people zone out after 15 minutes."

Step E1: Abstract: "Participants in a group activity lose engagement over time despite being physically present."

Step E2: Fields:
- Education (students zone out in lectures)
- Theater (audiences must stay engaged for 2 hours)
- Fitness (group workout classes maintain energy)
- Gaming (players stay engaged for hours)
- Religion (congregations sit through services)

Step E3: Approaches:
- Education → active recall every 10 minutes
- Theater → tension/release cycles, scene changes
- Fitness → rotate exercises every 3-5 minutes, music
- Gaming → variable rewards, player agency, progress bars
- Religion → call-and-response, singing, standing/sitting

Step E4: Translations:
- Active recall → every 10 min, someone gets asked to summarize what was just said
- Scene changes → physically move to a different room/board/screen every 15 min
- Exercise rotation → change the activity type (present→discuss→write→present)
- Player agency → attendees choose which topics to cover next
- Call-and-response → regular polls or hand-raise questions

Step E5: Cheapest to test = regular polls (no setup cost, try next meeting).

**Output**: Insert a 30-second live poll every 10 minutes. Borrowed from education's active recall + gaming's variable engagement.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping conventional solutions.** Unconventional should be a last resort. Most problems yield to straightforward effort applied consistently. Check Step 0 honestly.
2. **Confusing "I haven't heard of it" with "unconventional."** Google your problem first. Someone has probably solved it; you just haven't found their solution yet.
3. **Group brainstorming as the method.** Research consistently shows individuals generating ideas alone, then combining, outperforms group brainstorming. Do this procedure alone first.
4. **Treating the procedure as linear.** If Section A doesn't work, try B. If B doesn't work, try D. The sections are independent tools, not sequential steps.
5. **Not testing.** The most common failure: finding an unconventional solution, getting excited, and implementing it fully without a cheap test first.

## When to Override This Procedure

- **Life-or-death urgency**: Skip everything and copy whatever worked for someone in a similar situation. Unconventional creativity is a luxury of time.
- **You're an expert in the domain**: You've already internalized Sections A-C. Jump straight to D (Assumption Audit) — that's where experts get stuck.
- **The problem is interpersonal**: This procedure is designed for structural/technical/strategic problems. For relationship problems, direct honest conversation outperforms all clever strategies.
- **The problem is emotional, not practical**: If "finding a solution" is really "processing a situation," this procedure won't help. The solution is acceptance, not cleverness.
