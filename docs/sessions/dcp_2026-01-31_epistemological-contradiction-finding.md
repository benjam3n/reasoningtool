# DCP — Sophisticated Epistemological and Philosophical Question-Finding That Identifies Contradictions

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: sophisticated epistemological and philosophical question finding that identifies contradictions

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

**Core decision**: Given any body of claims, beliefs, arguments, or frameworks — how do you systematically find the *questions* that expose contradictions, unexamined assumptions, and structural weaknesses?

This is not "find answers." This is "find the questions that, once asked, make the contradictions visible to anyone."

| # | Dimension | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Source Type** | What kind of material are you interrogating? (A person's beliefs, a written argument, a formal system, a cultural assumption, your own thinking) | Different sources hide contradictions differently. Formal systems have logical contradictions. Belief systems have pragmatic contradictions. Cultural assumptions have invisible contradictions. |
| 2 | **Contradiction Type** | What kind of contradiction are you looking for? (Logical: P and ¬P. Pragmatic: saying X while doing ¬X. Structural: two commitments that can't both be satisfied. Temporal: past position contradicts present.) | Each type requires different question strategies. A logical contradiction is found by formalization. A pragmatic contradiction is found by comparing claims to behavior. |
| 3 | **Depth of Burial** | How deep is the contradiction hidden? (Surface: visible on first read. Shallow: visible after one inference step. Deep: requires multiple inference steps or cross-referencing. Foundational: baked into the axioms.) | Surface contradictions are easy. Foundational contradictions are invisible to people inside the system. The deeper it is, the more sophisticated the question must be. |
| 4 | **Stakeholder Defensiveness** | Will the person/system holding the beliefs resist contradiction-finding? (Welcomes it, tolerates it, resists it, attacks the questioner) | Defensive stakeholders require indirect questioning. Direct "isn't this contradictory?" gets dismissed. You need questions that let them discover the contradiction themselves. |
| 5 | **Scope of Coherence Expected** | How much consistency should the target material exhibit? (Perfect logical consistency, practical consistency, approximate coherence, acknowledged tensions) | A mathematical proof should have zero contradictions. A person's life philosophy can tolerate some tensions. The threshold determines what counts as a "finding." |
| 6 | **Epistemic Status of Claims** | Are the claims presented as certain, probable, speculative, or foundational? | Claims presented as certain are more interesting to contradict than acknowledged speculations. A contradiction between two "definitely true" claims is more significant than between two "maybe" claims. |
| 7 | **Domain** | What field or context do the claims live in? (Ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, science, everyday reasoning, mixed) | Each domain has characteristic contradiction patterns. Ethics: universalizability failures. Epistemology: self-reference problems. Politics: means-ends inconsistencies. |
| 8 | **Formalizability** | Can the claims be translated into formal logic, or are they inherently informal/vague? | Formalizable claims can be checked mechanically for logical contradictions. Informal claims require interpretive questioning — which is harder but often more revealing. |
| 9 | **Question Purpose** | Why are you finding these contradictions? (To improve the system, to refute it, to understand it, to teach critical thinking, to explore the space) | Purpose shapes question style. Improvement questions are constructive. Refutation questions are adversarial. Exploration questions are neutral. |
| 10 | **Self-Reference Risk** | Does the material make claims about its own validity, completeness, or methodology? | Self-referential claims are contradiction goldmines. "This system is complete" + Gödel. "All claims should be questioned" + "including this one?" The questions almost write themselves. |
| 11 | **Temporal Dimension** | Is the material a snapshot or an evolving system? Has it changed its positions over time? | Evolving systems accumulate contradictions as old positions aren't fully updated. Temporal questions ("You said X in 2020 and Y in 2024 — what changed?") expose these. |
| 12 | **Interlocutor Sophistication** | How philosophically trained is the target audience? | Sophisticated interlocutors have pre-built defenses against common contradiction-finding moves. You need to go deeper or more indirect. Naive interlocutors may not understand the question. |

---

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

**1. Source Type**: Individual's beliefs | Written argument | Formal system | Cultural assumption | Institutional policy | Your own thinking

**2. Contradiction Type**: Logical (P ∧ ¬P) | Pragmatic (say X, do ¬X) | Structural (two commitments can't coexist) | Temporal (past ≠ present) | Performative (the act of stating contradicts the content) | Value-conflict (two held values produce opposite prescriptions)

**3. Depth of Burial**: Surface | One step | Multi-step | Foundational/axiomatic

**4. Stakeholder Defensiveness**: Welcomes scrutiny | Tolerates | Resists | Hostile

**5. Scope of Coherence Expected**: Perfect | High | Moderate | Acknowledged tensions

**6. Epistemic Status**: Presented as certain | Presented as probable | Presented as speculative | Presented as axiomatic/definitional

**7. Domain**: Ethics | Metaphysics | Epistemology | Political | Scientific | Practical reasoning | Cross-domain

**8. Formalizability**: Fully formalizable | Partially | Inherently informal | Deliberately ambiguous

**9. Question Purpose**: Improve | Refute | Understand | Teach | Explore

**10. Self-Reference**: Heavy (makes metaclaims) | Some | None | Deliberately avoids it

**11. Temporal**: Static snapshot | Slowly evolving | Rapidly evolving | Contains explicit revision history

**12. Interlocutor Sophistication**: Philosophically trained | Generally educated | Untrained | Mixed audience

**Key Interactions**:
- If Self-Reference = Heavy AND Formalizability = High → Gödelian and self-reference questions are almost guaranteed to find contradictions
- If Depth = Foundational AND Defensiveness = Hostile → indirect questioning is essential; direct contradiction-naming will be rejected
- If Contradiction Type = Pragmatic AND Source = Individual → behavioral observation trumps logical analysis
- If Domain = Cross-domain → the richest contradictions live at the boundaries between domains

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Reality | Danger |
|---|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Contradictions are defects** | Some contradictions are generative. Dialectical thinking holds contradictions intentionally. Zen koans are deliberate contradictions. Calling all contradictions "problems" misses this. | You might "expose" a contradiction that the holder already knows about and values. The question sounds clever but misses the point. |
| 2 | **Finding contradictions requires philosophical sophistication** | Many powerful contradictions are found by asking simple questions persistently. "But what do you mean by X?" repeated 5 times often finds more than a sophisticated epistemological framework. | Over-sophistication produces impressive-sounding questions that miss obvious contradictions. The most devastating philosophical questions are often simple. |
| 3 | **The questioner is neutral** | Every question presupposes a framework. "Isn't that inconsistent?" presupposes that consistency is required. The questioner's own assumptions are invisible to them. | The procedure might find contradictions in the target while being oblivious to contradictions in its own framework for what counts as "contradiction." |
| 4 | **Logical contradictions are the most important kind** | Pragmatic contradictions (saying one thing, doing another) are more common and more consequential than logical ones. Most real-world belief systems don't have P ∧ ¬P; they have "I value X" + "my behavior optimizes for ¬X." | A procedure focused on logical contradictions misses the most impactful findings. |
| 5 | **The material has a fixed interpretation** | Most philosophical claims are ambiguous enough to support multiple interpretations. What looks like a contradiction under interpretation A disappears under interpretation B. The "contradiction" may be an artifact of how you're reading it. | Charitable interpretation (steelmanning) should precede contradiction-finding. Otherwise you're refuting strawmen. |
| 6 | **Questions are better than statements for exposing contradictions** | Sometimes a direct statement of the contradiction ("You claim X on page 3 and ¬X on page 47") is more effective than a question. Questions can be evasive. | The skill frames everything as "question-finding," but the output sometimes should be a direct identification, not a question. |
| 7 | **Comprehensiveness is possible** | Any non-trivial belief system has more potential contradictions than you can enumerate. Completeness is a mirage. | The procedure should target *the most significant* contradictions, not *all* contradictions. Prioritization > exhaustiveness. |
| 8 | **The person holding the beliefs can access them accurately** | People are poor reporters of their own beliefs. What someone says they believe and what their behavior reveals they believe are often different. Asking them about their beliefs only accesses the stated version. | The best contradiction-finding questions don't ask "what do you believe?" but rather construct scenarios where the beliefs are forced to collide. |

## Step 4: The Procedure

```
EPISTEMOLOGICAL CONTRADICTION-FINDING PROCEDURE
================================================

PURPOSE: Given any body of claims, beliefs, or arguments,
systematically generate the questions that expose hidden
contradictions, incoherences, and structural weaknesses.

PRODUCES: A ranked list of questions, each targeting a
specific potential contradiction, with an explanation of
what each question is probing.


STEP 0: WHAT ARE YOU INTERROGATING?
====================================

Q1: What form is the material in?
    → Written text (article, book, argument): Go to SECTION A
    → A person's stated beliefs: Go to SECTION B
    → A system or institution's practices: Go to SECTION C
    → Your own thinking: Go to SECTION D
    → A formal or semi-formal theory: Go to SECTION E


SECTION A: INTERROGATING A WRITTEN ARGUMENT
============================================

Step A1: Steelman first.
  ACTION: Read the material. Before looking for
  contradictions, write a 3-sentence summary of the
  STRONGEST VERSION of the argument.
  WHY: If you skip this, you'll find contradictions
  in strawmen. Wasted effort.
  WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: A summary the author would
  recognize as fair (or even generous).

Step A2: Extract all commitments.
  ACTION: Go through the text and list every claim
  the author is committed to. Write each as a single
  declarative sentence.
  FORMAT: "The author claims that ___."
  INCLUDE:
    - Explicit claims (stated directly)
    - Implicit claims (presupposed but not stated)
    - Methodological claims (how they say reasoning
      should work)
  TARGET: 10-30 commitments for a typical argument.
  WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: A numbered list of commitments.

Step A3: Run pairwise collision test.
  ACTION: For each pair of commitments, ask:
  "Can both of these be true simultaneously?"

  Three possible answers:
  (a) YES, obviously: Skip. No contradiction.
  (b) NO, they conflict: Write the contradiction down.
      Go to Step A6.
  (c) IT DEPENDS on interpretation: This is interesting.
      Go to Step A4.

  SHORTCUT: You don't need to test every pair (that's
  n²). Group commitments by topic. Test pairs WITHIN
  each topic group first. Then test pairs ACROSS groups
  (cross-domain contradictions are often the richest).

Step A4: Probe ambiguity.
  ACTION: For the "it depends" pairs from A3, identify
  the ambiguous term or concept.
  QUESTION TEMPLATE: "When you say [TERM] in claim #N,
  do you mean [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?
  Because if [A], it contradicts claim #M. And if [B],
  it contradicts claim #K."
  This is a FORK QUESTION — both interpretations lead
  to a contradiction. These are the strongest finds.
  WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: Questions that force a choice
  where every choice has a cost.

Step A5: Run the self-application test.
  ACTION: Does the text make any claim about how
  reasoning, knowledge, or truth works?
  → Yes: Apply that claim to itself.
    QUESTION: "Does this text's own methodology
    satisfy its own standards?"
    EXAMPLES:
    - "All claims require evidence" → What evidence
      supports THIS claim?
    - "We should question all assumptions" → Including
      this one?
    - "Rational argument is the only path to truth" →
      Is that itself a rationally argued conclusion, or
      an assumption?
  → No metaclaims: Skip to A6.

Step A6: Generate the question list.
  ACTION: For each contradiction found, write a question
  that would make the contradiction visible to a reader
  who hasn't noticed it.

  QUESTION QUALITY TEST: A good contradiction-exposing
  question has these properties:
  (a) It's answerable (not rhetorical)
  (b) Every possible answer reveals a problem
  (c) It uses the author's own terms, not external
      frameworks
  (d) It's short (under 30 words)

  BAD: "Don't you think there's some tension between
       your commitment to individual freedom and your
       support for regulation?" (rhetorical, vague)

  GOOD: "Your framework requires X. Your proposal does Y.
        How can X and Y both hold?" (specific, uses their
        terms, genuinely answerable)

Step A7: Rank by significance.
  ACTION: For each question, rate:
  (a) CENTRALITY: If this contradiction is real, does it
      damage the core argument or just a peripheral point?
      [core / supporting / peripheral]
  (b) ESCAPABILITY: Can the author resolve this easily, or
      would resolving it require abandoning a major
      commitment?
      [easy fix / difficult / devastating]
  RANK: Sort by centrality × difficulty of escape.
  Top-ranked = core contradictions with no easy resolution.

→ SECTION A COMPLETE.


SECTION B: INTERROGATING A PERSON'S BELIEFS
============================================

Step B1: Listen before questioning.
  ACTION: Let the person explain their position fully.
  Do not interrupt with questions yet.
  WHILE LISTENING, silently note:
  (a) Claims that seem to be in tension with each other
  (b) Values they invoke that might conflict in edge cases
  (c) Claims about themselves that might not match behavior
  WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: A mental (or written) list of
  potential tension points.

Step B2: Identify stated values and commitments.
  ACTION: After they finish, summarize back:
  "So you believe ___, ___, and ___. Is that right?"
  Get confirmation.
  PURPOSE: This locks them into specific claims you can
  test. Without confirmation, they can retroactively
  reinterpret.

Step B3: Construct collision scenarios.
  ACTION: For each pair of values/commitments that might
  conflict, construct a SCENARIO where they're forced
  to choose.

  TEMPLATE: "Imagine a situation where [commitment A]
  requires you to do X, but [commitment B] requires you
  to do Y. X and Y are incompatible. What do you do?"

  RULES for scenario construction:
  - Make the scenario REALISTIC (not absurd trolley problems)
  - Make it SPECIFIC (not abstract)
  - Make both horns GENUINELY costly (not an obvious choice)
  - Use their values, not yours

  EXAMPLE:
  Person claims to value both "honesty" and "kindness."
  Scenario: "Your friend asks your honest opinion about
  their work. You genuinely think it's bad. What do you
  say?" — Forces honesty and kindness into direct conflict.

Step B4: Ask boundary questions.
  ACTION: For each major belief, ask: "Under what
  circumstances would this not be true?"
  CHECK their answer:
  → They name specific exceptions: These exceptions
    may contradict other beliefs. Test that.
  → They say "never" / "always": This is the most
    vulnerable claim. Construct a single counterexample.
  → They struggle to answer: The belief hasn't been
    examined at its boundaries. Follow up with: "Could
    you imagine a case where [opposite of their belief]
    would be the right answer?"

Step B5: Ask pragmatic questions.
  ACTION: Compare their stated beliefs to their behavior.
  QUESTION: "You believe ___. How does that show up in
  how you [spend money / spend time / make decisions]?"
  CHECK: If there's a gap between stated belief and
  revealed behavior, ask: "What explains the difference?"
  This is NOT gotcha journalism. The gap often reveals
  a genuine tension the person hasn't resolved.

Step B6: Rank and deliver.
  ACTION: From B3-B5, identify the 2-3 strongest
  contradictions.
  DELIVERY: Frame as genuine curiosity, not attack.
  "I notice that [A] and [B] seem to pull in different
  directions. How do you hold those together?"
  WHY: This framing invites reflection rather than defense.

→ SECTION B COMPLETE.


SECTION C: INTERROGATING INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES
=================================================

Step C1: Extract the stated mission/values.
  ACTION: Find the institution's official mission,
  values statement, or founding principles.
  Write each value as a separate commitment.

Step C2: Map actual practices.
  ACTION: List 10 concrete things the institution
  DOES (resource allocation, hiring, policies, outputs).

Step C3: Run the alignment test.
  ACTION: For each practice from C2, ask:
  "Which stated value from C1 does this practice serve?"
  FLAG any practice that:
  (a) Serves no stated value → What unstated value does
      it actually serve?
  (b) Contradicts a stated value → Why does the
      institution do this if it believes that?
  (c) Serves one value while undermining another →
      Which value wins in practice?

Step C4: Ask the resource question.
  ACTION: "If I could only see the budget (not the
  mission statement), what would I conclude the
  institution values?"
  COMPARE to stated mission.
  QUESTION: "The budget says you value ___. The mission
  says you value ___. Which is true?"

Step C5: Generate institutional questions.
  FORMAT: Same as A6 — short, answerable, uses their
  own terms, every answer reveals something.

→ SECTION C COMPLETE.


SECTION D: INTERROGATING YOUR OWN THINKING
============================================

Step D1: Externalize.
  ACTION: Write down your beliefs about the topic
  as if someone else held them. Use third person.
  "This person believes that ___."
  WHY: Third person creates psychological distance,
  making it easier to question.

Step D2: Apply Sections A and B to yourself.
  ACTION: Treat your externalized beliefs as a written
  argument (Section A) AND as a person's beliefs
  (Section B). Run both procedures.

Step D3: Ask the inversion question.
  ACTION: "What would I have to see or learn to
  REVERSE my position on this?"
  CHECK:
  → You can name specific evidence: Good. Is that
    evidence actually available? Have you looked?
  → You can't name anything: Your belief may be
    unfalsifiable. That's epistemologically
    problematic. Question: "If nothing could change
    my mind, what kind of belief is this?"

Step D4: Ask the origin question.
  ACTION: "How did I come to believe this? Did I
  reason my way to it, or did I absorb it?"
  If absorbed (from culture, authority, upbringing):
  "Would I have arrived here by reasoning alone?"
  This doesn't invalidate the belief, but it
  identifies beliefs that haven't been independently
  verified.

→ SECTION D COMPLETE.


SECTION E: INTERROGATING A FORMAL OR SEMI-FORMAL THEORY
========================================================

Step E1: Identify the axioms.
  ACTION: List every starting assumption, premise, or
  axiom the theory takes as given.
  For semi-formal theories: also list the definitions.
  CHECK: Are any axioms implicitly contradictory?
  TEST: Negate each axiom individually. Does the theory
  still work? If negating axiom X changes nothing, it
  may be redundant or decorative.

Step E2: Check scope claims.
  ACTION: Does the theory claim to be:
  (a) Universal (applies to everything in its domain)
  (b) Complete (accounts for all phenomena in its domain)
  (c) Self-consistent (no internal contradictions)
  (d) Foundational (doesn't depend on external theories)

  For each claim:
  QUESTION: "Can you demonstrate [universality /
  completeness / consistency / independence] within
  the theory itself, or does it require something
  outside the theory?"
  If the theory can't self-validate: "What external
  standard are you using, and what justifies THAT?"

Step E3: Apply Gödel-style pressure.
  ACTION: Does the theory make claims about its own
  properties?
  → Yes: "Can the theory prove its own consistency?"
    If it claims to: it's either inconsistent or
    not as powerful as it claims (Gödel's second
    incompleteness theorem, informally).
  → No metaclaims: Skip to E4.

Step E4: Find the boundary.
  ACTION: Construct the simplest possible case that
  the theory struggles with.
  METHOD: Start with a clear case the theory handles.
  Modify one variable at a time until the theory
  breaks or gives an unsatisfying answer.
  QUESTION: "At exactly what point does the theory
  stop working, and why?"

Step E5: Generate formal questions.
  FORMAT: Same quality test as A6.
  ADDITIONAL CRITERION for formal theories:
  The question should be EXPRESSIBLE in the theory's
  own language. If it can't even be asked within
  the theory, that itself is a finding.

→ SECTION E COMPLETE.
```

## Step 5: Failure Modes

| # | Failure Mode | How to Recognize | What to Do |
|---|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | **Gotcha hunting** | You're looking for contradictions to win an argument, not to understand. Your questions feel like cross-examination. | Check your purpose (dimension 9). If it's "refute," acknowledge it. If it's supposed to be "understand" or "improve," your questions should feel like genuine curiosity, not prosecution. Rewrite any question that starts with "But didn't you say..." |
| 2 | **Strawmanning** | You find "contradictions" that disappear under a charitable reading. The author could easily say "that's not what I meant." | You skipped Step A1 (steelman). Go back. If the contradiction survives the strongest interpretation, it's real. If it only survives the weakest, it's a strawman. |
| 3 | **Superficial formalization** | You translated informal claims into formal logic, "found" a contradiction, but the translation was unfaithful. The original claims aren't actually contradictory — your formalization distorted them. | Before claiming a logical contradiction, express it back in natural language and ask: "Would the author agree this is what they said?" If not, the problem is your translation, not their reasoning. |
| 4 | **Missing the pragmatic for the logical** | You exhaustively checked logical consistency but ignored that the person says they value honesty while lying constantly. The behavioral contradiction is more important than any logical one. | Always run Section B (pragmatic questioning) in addition to Section A (logical analysis). If you can only do one, pragmatic contradictions are usually more impactful. |
| 5 | **Infinite regress disguised as depth** | You keep asking "but what justifies THAT?" forever. Every justification requires a further justification. This isn't finding contradictions — it's the Münchhausen trilemma, and it applies to everything equally. | The Münchhausen trilemma (infinite regress, circularity, or dogmatism) is a feature of ALL justification, not a specific contradiction in any particular system. If your "contradiction" is just "this thing eventually needs unjustified axioms," you've found nothing specific. Every system has this. Find contradictions *within* the axioms, not *between* the axioms and the demand for infinite justification. |
| 6 | **Treating all contradictions as equal** | You list 20 contradictions without ranking them. The person or audience can't tell which ones matter. | Always rank (Step A7). A contradiction between two peripheral claims is noise. A contradiction at the foundational level is the finding. |
| 7 | **Self-exemption** | Your procedure for finding contradictions is itself contradictory or assumption-laden, and you don't notice because you're focused outward. | Periodically run Section D on your own questioning methodology. What are YOU assuming? Is your notion of "contradiction" consistent? Do you apply the same standards to your own framework? |
| 8 | **Confusing tension with contradiction** | Two beliefs in tension ("I value freedom AND I value safety") aren't contradictory unless there's a specific case where they can't both be satisfied AND the person refuses to acknowledge the tradeoff. Tensions are normal. Contradictions are when the tension is denied. | Before declaring contradiction, ask: "Does the belief-holder acknowledge this tension?" If yes, it's a known tradeoff, not a hidden contradiction. The finding is only interesting if they claim both hold absolutely. |

---

## Step 6: Validation

Executability check:

- **A1**: "Write a 3-sentence steelman" — concrete action. Pass.
- **A2**: "List every claim as a declarative sentence" — concrete, slightly labor-intensive but mechanical. Pass.
- **A3**: "Can both be true simultaneously?" — binary test. The grouping shortcut prevents combinatorial explosion. Pass.
- **A4**: Fork questions have a clear template. Pass.
- **A5**: Self-application test is concrete and has examples. Pass.
- **A6**: Quality test has 4 observable criteria. The BAD/GOOD example makes it concrete. Pass.
- **A7**: Two-axis ranking with named scales. Pass.
- **B1-B6**: All concrete. Scenario construction in B3 requires creativity, but the template and rules constrain it. Pass.
- **C1-C5**: All concrete. The budget question (C4) is particularly mechanical. Pass.
- **D1-D4**: Externalization (D1) is a concrete technique. The inversion question (D3) has clear outputs. Pass.
- **E1-E5**: Formal theory steps require some logical literacy. This is appropriate for the domain (you shouldn't interrogate formal theories without understanding formal logic). Pass for the audience.
- **Dead ends**: All sections terminate at a ranked question list. Pass.
- **Ambiguity**: The "it depends" category in A3 is intentionally ambiguous — it routes to A4, which resolves the ambiguity. Pass.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**The 5 most powerful contradiction-finding questions** (memorize these):

1. **The Fork**: "When you say [term], do you mean A or B? Because if A, then [problem]. If B, then [different problem]."

2. **The Self-Application**: "Does your method meet its own standards?"

3. **The Collision Scenario**: "Imagine a case where your commitment to X requires action A, but your commitment to Y requires action B. A and B are incompatible. Which wins?"

4. **The Budget Test**: "If I could only see what you spend [time/money/attention] on, and not what you SAY you value, what would I conclude you value?"

5. **The Boundary Probe**: "Under what circumstances would this not be true? If no circumstances — what kind of claim is this?"

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Skipping the steelman.** If you don't understand the strongest version of the position, you'll find fake contradictions.
2. **Only looking for logical contradictions.** Pragmatic contradictions (belief vs. behavior) and structural contradictions (two commitments that can't coexist) are more common and more important.
3. **Treating the Münchhausen trilemma as a specific finding.** "You have unjustified axioms" applies to literally everything. It's not a contradiction — it's the human epistemic condition.
4. **Confusing acknowledged tensions with hidden contradictions.** If someone says "I know freedom and safety are in tension, and I try to balance them," you haven't found a contradiction. You've found someone who already did the work.
5. **Self-exempting your own framework from scrutiny.** Your method for finding contradictions rests on assumptions too. Apply it to itself periodically.

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **The material is deliberately paradoxical.** Zen koans, dialectical philosophy, and some art intentionally embrace contradiction. This procedure will "find" what the author already knows and intended. Use interpretive reading instead.
- **The contradictions are all trivial.** If every contradiction you find is easily resolvable ("oh, I was using the word differently in those two places"), the material may be more coherent than this procedure suggests. Accept coherence as a possible finding.
- **You need expertise, not methodology.** Finding contradictions in quantum mechanics or Heidegger requires domain knowledge that no procedure can substitute for. This procedure helps structure the inquiry. It doesn't replace knowing the subject.
- **The person is in distress.** If someone shares their beliefs in a moment of vulnerability, running a contradiction-finding procedure on them is harmful regardless of its intellectual merits. Read the room.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Interrogating an essay arguing "Free will is an illusion"

**A1 (Steelman)**: The author argues that all mental events are determined by prior physical states, that the subjective experience of choosing is a post-hoc narrative, and that moral responsibility should be reconceived as social pragmatism rather than metaphysical desert.

**A2 (Commitments)**:
1. All mental events are determined by prior physical states.
2. The experience of choosing is a post-hoc narrative.
3. We should reconceive moral responsibility.
4. This reconception is better than the traditional view.
5. The reader should accept this argument.

**A5 (Self-Application)**: Commitment 5 ("you should accept this") presupposes the reader CAN accept it — that they have some capacity to evaluate and choose. But commitments 1-2 say all mental events are determined and choice is illusory.

**Question**: "If I accept your argument, it's because I was determined to. If I reject it, same. On your view, what does it mean to say I 'should' accept it?"

**A7**: Centrality = core. Escapability = difficult (requires redefining "should" in a way that doesn't presuppose choice). **Rank: #1.**

### Example 2: Interrogating a company's values

**C1**: Values: "Innovation," "Employee Wellbeing," "Customer First," "Move Fast."
**C2**: Practices: 60-hour work weeks, quarterly OKRs, rapid shipping, minimal testing.
**C4 (Budget test)**: Budget says: speed and shipping above all.

**Question**: "Your values list 'Employee Wellbeing.' Your average engineer works 60 hours/week. What does 'wellbeing' mean in the context of a 60-hour week?"

This is a fork: either "wellbeing" means something unusual, or the practice contradicts the value.

### Example 3: Self-interrogation

**D1**: "This person believes that systematic questioning can find all important contradictions in any body of claims."
**D3 (Inversion)**: "What would I need to see to believe this procedure CAN'T find important contradictions?" → A contradiction that the procedure systematically misses.
**D4 (Origin)**: "I believe this because I built the procedure. That's author bias, not evidence."
**Finding**: The procedure assumes contradictions are the most important things to find. But what about *absences* — things the material should address but doesn't? Contradictions are between things that ARE said. The most important weakness might be what ISN'T said. This procedure has no mechanism for finding significant silences.

**Self-improvement**: Add an absence-detection step: "What questions does this material conspicuously NOT address that any treatment of this topic should?"

---

*Validation status: This procedure has not been validated by professional philosophers, epistemologists, or critical thinking instructors. It synthesizes techniques from Socratic elenchus, analytic philosophy, pragmatist critique, and informal logic. Apply with appropriate epistemic humility.*
