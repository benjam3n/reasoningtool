**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: Calibrating how much thinking to do — the universal effort-allocation step before any analysis

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

Fourteen dimensions determine how much thinking a situation actually requires.

### D1 — Stakes Magnitude
What is the worst realistic outcome if you get this wrong?

### D2 — Reversibility
If the decision turns out badly, how easily can you undo it or course-correct?

### D3 — Information Ceiling
Is more thinking actually capable of producing better information, or have you already hit the ceiling of what is knowable before acting?

### D4 — Diminishing Returns Curve
How steep is the dropoff? Some decisions improve dramatically with 5 minutes of thought and not at all with 5 hours. Others scale linearly. A few reward deep analysis all the way through.

### D5 — Time Sensitivity
How much does delay cost? A decision needed in 10 seconds has a different effort budget than one needed in 10 days, regardless of stakes.

### D6 — Cognitive Load / Context Pollution
How much will extended analysis clutter your working memory, fill your context window, or crowd out other important work? Over-analysis does not just waste time — it actively degrades decision quality by burying the signal in noise.

### D7 — Recurrence
Is this a one-time decision or a pattern you will face repeatedly? Recurring decisions justify higher upfront investment because the procedure amortizes across many instances.

### D8 — Delegation Fitness
Are you the right entity to be thinking about this? Could someone (or something) with better expertise, cheaper time, or more context handle this more efficiently?

### D9 — Your Calibration Track Record
Do you personally (or does your team/organization) tend to overthink or underthink? Your default bias determines which direction you need to correct.

### D10 — Social Pressure Direction
Is the environment pushing you to over-analyze (corporate CYA culture, committee review) or under-analyze (move fast and break things, peer pressure to decide quickly)?

### D11 — Thinking Type Required
Does this need quick pattern matching, structured analysis, creative exploration, emotional processing, or some combination? Different thinking types have different effort profiles.

### D12 — Discovery Risk
How likely is it that the stakes, options, or constraints will change significantly once you start analyzing? High discovery risk means you should analyze in short bursts and re-evaluate, not commit to a deep upfront pass.

### D13 — Error Asymmetry
Is it worse to over-invest or under-invest in thinking? For some decisions (surgery, launching a rocket), under-thinking is catastrophic and over-thinking is merely expensive. For others (choosing a restaurant, picking a name for a variable), over-thinking wastes more value than under-thinking ever could.

### D14 — The Meta-Cost
How much effort is the calibration itself consuming? This dimension exists to prevent infinite regress. If you are spending more than 90 seconds deciding how much to think, you are already over-investing in calibration for all but the highest-stakes decisions.

---

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

### D1 — Stakes Magnitude
| Level | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Trivial** | Outcome difference between best and worst choice is negligible | What to eat for lunch, which synonym to use, color of a button |
| **Minor** | Wrong choice causes inconvenience lasting hours to days | Which route to take, which meeting to attend, a minor purchase |
| **Moderate** | Wrong choice causes weeks of rework, meaningful financial loss, or reputational cost | Hiring a contractor, choosing a technical architecture for a feature, pricing a product |
| **Major** | Wrong choice causes months or years of consequences, large financial loss, or relationship damage | Accepting a job offer, choosing a co-founder, entering a market |
| **Severe** | Wrong choice causes irreversible life or organizational damage | Major surgery decision, bet-the-company strategy, legal plea, marriage |

### D2 — Reversibility
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Freely reversible** | Can undo with zero cost at any time |
| **Cheaply reversible** | Can undo but with some time/money/social cost |
| **Expensively reversible** | Can technically undo but at high cost |
| **Practically irreversible** | Reversal is theoretically possible but so costly it will not happen |
| **Absolutely irreversible** | Cannot be undone under any circumstances |

### D3 — Information Ceiling
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Already at ceiling** | You have all relevant information; more analysis will recombine the same facts |
| **Near ceiling** | One or two more inputs could help, but you know what they are |
| **Mid-range** | Meaningful unknowns exist and could be resolved with effort |
| **Far from ceiling** | Major unknowns; substantial research could shift the answer |
| **Unknowable before action** | The critical information only becomes available by acting |

### D4 — Diminishing Returns Curve
| Shape | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cliff** | 2 minutes of thought gets you 90% of the value; everything after is noise |
| **Steep then flat** | 15-30 minutes gets most of the value, then returns flatten |
| **Linear** | Each additional hour of analysis yields proportional improvement |
| **Late-blooming** | Insights only emerge after sustained deep work (rare but real) |
| **Negative** | Additional analysis actively makes the decision worse (overthinking creative decisions, second-guessing intuition in domains of expertise) |

### D5 — Time Sensitivity
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Immediate** | Decision needed in seconds (emergency, live conversation) |
| **Urgent** | Decision needed within hours |
| **Standard** | Decision needed within days |
| **Patient** | Decision needed within weeks to months |
| **Open-ended** | No external deadline |

### D6 — Cognitive Load / Context Pollution
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Clean** | Analysis can proceed without crowding out other concerns |
| **Manageable** | Some context cost, but containable |
| **Expensive** | Deep analysis will dominate working memory / context window and degrade other work |
| **Toxic** | Over-analysis will produce so much noise that the signal gets lost |

### D7 — Recurrence
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **One-time** | You will never face this exact decision again |
| **Occasional** | Similar decisions arise a few times per year |
| **Frequent** | You face this type of decision weekly or more |
| **Continuous** | This is an ongoing calibration, not a discrete decision |

### D8 — Delegation Fitness
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **You are the best person** | No one available has better context, expertise, or authority |
| **Peer-level alternative** | Someone else could do this equally well |
| **Expert available** | Someone with much better expertise could handle this |
| **Automatable** | A rule, heuristic, or tool could handle this without human thought |

### D9 — Your Calibration Track Record
| Bias | Description |
|---|---|
| **Chronic overthinker** | You routinely analyze past the point of usefulness; your default needs less thinking |
| **Balanced** | Your instinct for effort level is generally appropriate |
| **Chronic underthinker** | You routinely decide before adequate analysis; your default needs more thinking |
| **Context-dependent** | You overthink in some domains and underthink in others |

### D10 — Social Pressure Direction
| Direction | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pressure to over-analyze** | Culture rewards visible thoroughness, punishes fast decisions |
| **Neutral** | No significant social pressure in either direction |
| **Pressure to under-analyze** | Culture rewards speed, punishes deliberation |

### D11 — Thinking Type Required
| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pattern match** | Recognize a familiar pattern and apply known solution |
| **Structured analysis** | Systematically evaluate options against criteria |
| **Creative exploration** | Generate novel possibilities; divergent thinking |
| **Emotional processing** | Acknowledge and integrate feelings before deciding |
| **Compound** | Multiple thinking types needed in sequence |

### D12 — Discovery Risk
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Low** | The problem is well-defined and unlikely to shift during analysis |
| **Medium** | Some chance that analysis reveals the problem is different than assumed |
| **High** | Significant chance the real question is not the apparent question |

### D13 — Error Asymmetry
| Direction | Description |
|---|---|
| **Under-thinking is catastrophic** | The cost of deciding too fast dwarfs the cost of over-analyzing |
| **Roughly symmetric** | Over- and under-thinking carry similar costs |
| **Over-thinking is catastrophic** | The cost of analysis paralysis dwarfs the cost of an imperfect fast decision |

### D14 — The Meta-Cost
| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Negligible** | Calibration took < 30 seconds |
| **Acceptable** | Calibration took 30-90 seconds |
| **Excessive** | Calibration itself is consuming meaningful time; stop calibrating and pick a level |

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

### Assumption 1: "More thinking is always better"
**Reality**: This is the most dangerous assumption in all of decision science. Beyond a threshold, additional analysis degrades decision quality. Mechanisms: noise accumulates, signal gets buried, you start optimizing for dimensions that do not matter, you lose the thread of your own intuition, you fill context with low-value hedging, and you exhaust cognitive resources that were needed elsewhere. The relationship between thinking effort and decision quality is an inverted U.

### Assumption 2: "You can know in advance how much thinking is enough"
**Reality**: This is a chicken-and-egg problem. You cannot perfectly calibrate effort without doing some of the analysis, because the analysis itself reveals how complex the problem is. The solution is not to get calibration perfect upfront — it is to calibrate roughly, start, and recalibrate partway through (see Section D of the procedure).

### Assumption 3: "The stakes are obvious from the outset"
**Reality**: Often they are not. You discover that a decision is higher-stakes than expected only after you start analyzing it. Conversely, analysis sometimes reveals that a "big" decision is actually trivial because all options lead to similar outcomes. This is why the recalibration check (Section D) is not optional.

### Assumption 4: "Analysis and action are separate sequential phases"
**Reality**: For many decisions, the fastest path to a good outcome is to act in order to learn. A 30-minute prototype teaches you more than a 30-hour analysis. A quick conversation with the other party reveals information no amount of solo thinking could produce. The effort-allocation question is not just "how much to think" but "when to switch from thinking to acting."

### Assumption 5: "Effort calibration is a one-time gate at the start"
**Reality**: Correct calibration is a continuous function. You should re-evaluate effort level at natural breakpoints throughout any analysis. The procedure below builds this in explicitly.

### Assumption 6: "All thinking effort is fungible"
**Reality**: Thirty minutes of structured analysis, thirty minutes of creative brainstorming, and thirty minutes of anxious rumination are radically different. Effort calibration must consider the type of thinking, not just the quantity.

### Assumption 7: "The decision-maker's time is the only cost"
**Reality**: Over-analysis also costs the time of everyone waiting for you, the opportunity cost of delayed action, the cognitive cost of keeping the decision "open" in your mental queue, and — in AI contexts — the literal cost of context window space that could be used for execution.

---

## Step 4: The Procedure

### STEP 0 — Quick Triage (Complete in under 60 seconds)

Answer these three questions. Do not deliberate. Use your first instinct.

**Q1**: "If I flip a coin right now, would the outcome be roughly acceptable?"
- YES → Effort Level: MINIMUM. Go to Section A.
- NO → Continue to Q2.

**Q2**: "If I get this wrong, will I still care in 6 months?"
- NO → Effort Level: MINIMUM or LOW-STANDARD. Lean toward Section A; go to Section B only if your gut says B.
- YES → Continue to Q3.

**Q3**: "Can I easily reverse or adjust this decision after making it?"
- YES → Effort Level: STANDARD. Go to Section B.
- NO → Effort Level: MAXIMUM. Go to Section C.

**Override rule**: If any answer took more than 15 seconds of hesitation, bump up one effort level. Hesitation itself is information that the decision is more complex than it appears.

**Meta-guard**: The triage itself must take under 60 seconds. If you catch yourself deliberating about the triage questions, pick Section B (Standard) and move on. The recalibration check in Section D exists precisely for this case.

---

### SECTION A — Minimum Effort Path

**When to use**: Trivial stakes, freely reversible, or coin-flip-acceptable decisions.

**Total time budget**: 2 minutes maximum.

**Procedure**:

A1. State the decision in one sentence.

A2. List at most 3 options. (If you cannot think of 3, that is fine. If you can think of more than 3, stop at 3 — you are over-investing.)

A3. Pick the one that feels right. Do not justify it. Do not list pros and cons. Gut feeling is sufficient for coin-flip-acceptable decisions.

A4. Act immediately. Do not revisit.

**Hard constraint**: If you reach the 2-minute mark without having decided, pick whichever option you were most recently considering and execute it. The cost of continued deliberation now exceeds the cost of any wrong answer.

---

### SECTION B — Standard Effort Path

**When to use**: Moderate stakes, reversible with some cost, "I would care if I got this wrong but it would not be catastrophic."

**Total time budget**: 5-30 minutes, depending on scope. Set a timer. When the timer expires, decide with whatever you have.

**Procedure**:

B1. State the decision in one sentence and identify the single most important criterion (the one factor that, if satisfied, makes the decision good enough regardless of other factors).

B2. List 3-5 options. If you have fewer than 3, spend 2 minutes generating more. If you have more than 5, eliminate the weakest until you are at 5. Do not spend more than 3 minutes on this step.

B3. Evaluate each option against your single most important criterion only. Score each option as STRONG / ADEQUATE / WEAK on that criterion. Eliminate all WEAK options.

B4. Among remaining options, check for dealbreakers — any single factor (not your primary criterion) that would make an option unacceptable. Eliminate any option with a dealbreaker.

B5. From surviving options, pick the one with the most upside or the one you can start executing fastest (speed of execution is a tiebreaker, not a primary criterion).

B6. State your decision. Write one sentence on why. Execute.

B7. Schedule a check-in. For any Standard-effort decision, note when you will assess whether the decision was correct (e.g., "Revisit in 2 weeks"). This is your safety net for cases where you should have used Section C.

**Hard constraint**: If you are past 30 minutes, you have left Section B territory. Either commit now or admit this is a Section C decision and restart there.

---

### SECTION C — Maximum Effort Path

**When to use**: High stakes, practically irreversible, "getting this wrong would haunt me."

**Total time budget**: 1-8 hours of active analysis, spread across at least 2 sessions with a break between them (sleep on it if the timeline allows). Set total time budget at the start; do not extend it by more than 25%.

**Procedure**:

C1. **Frame**: State the decision, the deadline, the key stakeholders, and the 2-3 most important criteria.

C2. **Enumerate**: List all plausible options (aim for 5-10). Include at least one unconventional option and the option of "do nothing / delay."

C3. **Research**: For each option, identify the 1-3 facts that would most change your assessment if they turned out differently than you assume. Spend your research time on those specific facts, not on general background. Set a research time limit equal to 40% of your total time budget.

C4. **Evaluate**: Score each option against your 2-3 criteria. Use a simple scale (1-5 or Low/Medium/High). Do not use weighted scoring formulas — they create false precision. Instead, look at the scores and ask: "Does any option dominate (better on all criteria)? Does any option have a fatal flaw?"

C5. **Stress test the leader**: Take your current frontrunner and actively argue against it for 5 minutes. What is the strongest case for a different option? If the counter-argument is compelling, switch to a comparison between the top 2 only.

C6. **Pre-mortem**: Assume you chose the frontrunner and it failed badly. Write 2-3 sentences describing the most likely failure scenario. Then ask: "Can I mitigate this failure mode?" If yes, note the mitigation and proceed. If no, seriously consider the second-place option.

C7. **Decide**: Commit. Write your decision, the top reason for it, and the one thing that would make you reverse it (your "reversal trigger").

C8. **Act**: Begin execution within 24 hours. A decision that is not acted on decays rapidly.

**Hard constraint**: You must reach C7 within your stated time budget plus 25% buffer. If you are not there, apply the Emergency Close: pick the option that is best on your single most important criterion and commit.

---

### SECTION D — The Recalibration Check

**When to run**: At the natural midpoint of any analysis, or when you feel a vague sense of "this is taking longer than it should" or "this feels too casual for what's at stake."

**Procedure** (complete in under 2 minutes):

D1. Restate what you are deciding in one sentence.

D2. Restate your current effort level (A / B / C).

D3. Ask: "Given what I have learned SO FAR in this analysis, is this effort level still correct?"
- If the problem is simpler than expected → Drop to a lower section and fast-forward to the decision step.
- If the problem is more complex than expected → Move to a higher section from the step you are currently on.
- If the effort level is correct → Continue.

D4. Ask: "Am I actually making progress, or am I circling?" Circling means: you are generating new considerations but none of them are changing your leaning. If circling, skip to the decision step of your current section.

D5. Ask: "Would taking a small action right now teach me more than continued analysis?" If yes, pause the analysis, take the action, and resume with new information.

**Hard constraint**: The recalibration check must complete in 2 minutes. If it does not, your answer is "I am over-investing" — drop one section level immediately.

---

### SECTION E — Recovery from Over-Investment (Analysis Paralysis Exit)

**When to use**: You realize you have been thinking about this for far longer than the decision warrants. You feel stuck, overwhelmed, or unable to choose.

**Procedure**:

E1. Stop all analysis immediately. Do not finish the thought you are in the middle of.

E2. Write down your current top 2 options (no more). If you cannot identify 2, write down the last option you were considering and "the opposite of that."

E3. For each option, complete this sentence: "If I commit to this right now and never look back, the most likely outcome is ______." Write the most likely outcome, not the worst case.

E4. Pick the option with the better most-likely outcome. If they are approximately equal, pick the one that is faster to execute.

E5. Commit. Announce your decision out loud, in writing, or to another person. Making the commitment external makes it real.

E6. Set a "no-revisit" window: you are not allowed to reconsider this decision for a specified period (at least 48 hours for minor decisions, at least 2 weeks for major ones), UNLESS your pre-defined reversal trigger fires.

E7. Forgive the sunk cost. The time you spent over-analyzing is gone. It does not mean the decision needs to be proportionally momentous. A $2 decision that you accidentally spent 3 hours on is still a $2 decision.

---

## Step 5: Failure Modes

### FM1 — Analysis Paralysis
**What it looks like**: You keep finding "one more thing to consider." Each new consideration feels important. You cannot bring yourself to commit because you have not achieved certainty.
**Root cause**: Confusing "I have not achieved certainty" with "I have not done enough analysis." Certainty is not achievable for most decisions. Analysis cannot produce it.
**Fix**: Set a hard time limit at the start. When it expires, apply the Emergency Close (pick the frontrunner on your primary criterion). Run Section E if needed.

### FM2 — Effort Theater
**What it looks like**: You produce lengthy analysis documents, compare many options, create spreadsheets — but your actual decision was obvious from the start and the analysis is performative.
**Root cause**: Social or organizational pressure to appear thorough. Fear that a fast decision will be perceived as careless.
**Fix**: Ask yourself: "If I could decide privately with no one watching, would I need this analysis?" If no, you are doing theater. Decide, and use the analysis time for something productive. If the theater is organizationally required, separate the decision (make it now) from the documentation (produce it after, describing your reasoning).

### FM3 — Premature Closure
**What it looks like**: You decide immediately and feel confident, but you missed one piece of information that would have completely changed the answer.
**Root cause**: Overconfidence in pattern matching. The situation looked familiar but was not.
**Fix**: Even for Section A decisions, complete the full 2-minute procedure. For Section B and C decisions, always check for dealbreakers (B4) and always run the stress test (C5). These steps exist specifically to catch premature closure.

### FM4 — Stakes Inflation
**What it looks like**: You treat every decision as if it were irreversible and life-altering. Choosing a restaurant becomes a Section C analysis. Picking a font becomes a 30-minute deliberation.
**Root cause**: Anxiety, perfectionism, or an environment that punishes any suboptimal outcome.
**Fix**: Apply the Q1 triage question aggressively: "If I flip a coin, would the outcome be roughly acceptable?" For the vast majority of daily decisions, the honest answer is yes. Trust the triage.

### FM5 — Stakes Deflation
**What it looks like**: You treat a genuinely high-stakes decision casually because it is uncomfortable to confront the gravity of it, or because the consequences are delayed.
**Root cause**: Avoidance, temporal discounting (consequences that are far away feel less real), or normalcy bias.
**Fix**: Specifically ask Q2: "Will I still care about this in 6 months?" If the honest answer is yes, you must use at least Section B. Also check: "Is this reversible?" If not, you must use Section C regardless of your comfort level.

### FM6 — Sunk Cost of Analysis
**What it looks like**: You have been analyzing for 4 hours, so you feel you need to keep going because "it would be a waste to stop now." The analysis has long since stopped producing useful new information.
**Root cause**: Sunk cost fallacy applied to thinking effort.
**Fix**: Run the Recalibration Check (Section D). Specifically D4: "Am I making progress or circling?" If circling, the additional analysis is not just wasteful — it is actually degrading your decision quality by burying your earlier good thinking under noise.

### FM7 — Meta-Spiral
**What it looks like**: You spend 20 minutes deciding how much effort to invest in deciding. The calibration itself becomes the analysis paralysis.
**Root cause**: Treating effort calibration as a decision that itself requires deep analysis. It does not. The triage is designed to be fast and rough precisely to avoid this.
**Fix**: The 60-second hard limit on Step 0 exists for this reason. If triage takes more than 60 seconds, default to Section B. The recalibration check (Section D) catches cases where the default was wrong.

### FM8 — Wrong Thinking Type
**What it looks like**: You apply structured analysis to a decision that required creative exploration, or vice versa. The effort level was correct but the effort type was wrong.
**Root cause**: Defaulting to your preferred thinking style rather than matching the style to the problem.
**Fix**: At Step 0, add a half-second check: "Does this need analysis, creativity, emotional processing, or expert input?" If it needs something other than analysis, more structured analysis is the wrong kind of effort.

### FM9 — Delegation Failure
**What it looks like**: You invest significant effort in a decision that someone else could have handled better, faster, or cheaper.
**Root cause**: Ego, control needs, or failure to recognize that delegation is itself a legitimate "effort calibration" outcome.
**Fix**: Before beginning any Section B or C analysis, ask: "Is there someone who could make this decision better than me in less time?" If yes, delegate. Your effort is spent on framing the decision clearly for them, not on analyzing it yourself.

## Step 6: Validation

### Executability Check

| Step | Mechanically Executable? | Requires Judgment? | Fix if Judgment-Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 0, Q1 | Yes — binary yes/no | Minimal — gut response is the point | N/A |
| Step 0, Q2 | Yes — binary yes/no | Minimal | N/A |
| Step 0, Q3 | Yes — binary yes/no | Minimal | N/A |
| Section A (all) | Yes — hard time limit, option cap, forced commit | A3 uses gut feeling intentionally | Gut feel is the correct tool for trivial decisions; no fix needed |
| Section B, B1 | Requires identifying "most important criterion" | Yes — moderate judgment | Add fallback: if you cannot identify it in 2 minutes, use "which option am I least likely to regret?" |
| Section B, B2-B6 | Yes — mechanical steps with hard caps | Minimal | N/A |
| Section C, C1-C2 | Yes — structured enumeration | Minimal | N/A |
| Section C, C3 | Requires identifying "facts that would change assessment" | Yes — moderate judgment | Add: "For each option, what could go wrong? What would you need to know to rule it out?" |
| Section C, C4 | Yes — explicit scoring | Minimal — intentionally avoids weighted formulas | N/A |
| Section C, C5-C7 | Yes — structured adversarial steps | Minimal | N/A |
| Section D (all) | Yes — binary questions with forced outcomes | D5 requires judgment on "small action" | Add: "An action that takes less than 10 minutes and produces observable results" |
| Section E (all) | Yes — forced-choice with hard constraints | Minimal | N/A |

### Completeness Check

- Does the procedure handle the case where you genuinely do not know the stakes? **Yes** — Section D (Recalibration Check) catches cases where stakes were misjudged. The procedure assumes initial calibration will sometimes be wrong and builds in correction mechanisms.
- Does the procedure handle the case where someone is using this procedure for the first time? **Yes** — Step 0 is simple enough to use without training. The Sections are labeled clearly by effort level.
- Does the procedure prevent its own failure mode (meta-spiral)? **Yes** — The 60-second triage limit and the 2-minute recalibration limit are hard constraints that mechanically prevent meta-spiral.
- Does the procedure work for AI systems as well as humans? **Yes** — All steps are executable by an LLM. The time budgets translate to "token budgets" or "step budgets" in an AI context. Section A becomes "respond in 1-3 sentences." Section B becomes "analyze in one pass, no more than 500 words of reasoning." Section C becomes "full multi-pass analysis."

## COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Treating the triage as the analysis
The triage (Step 0) determines effort level. It is not a substitute for the analysis itself. Do not answer Q1-Q3 and then declare the decision made (unless Q1 is YES, in which case Section A is the analysis and it takes 2 minutes).

### Mistake 2: Upgrading effort level without upgrading time budget
If you move from Section B to Section C mid-analysis, you must actually allocate more time. Running Section C steps in a Section B time budget produces the worst of both worlds: the overhead of a thorough process without the time to do it properly. Set a new timer when you upgrade.

### Mistake 3: Using Section C out of anxiety rather than stakes
The question is not "how anxious does this decision make me?" The question is "what happens if I get it wrong?" Anxiety is not evidence of high stakes. A phobic person may be terrified of a trivially-staked decision. Use the triage questions, not your emotional temperature.

### Mistake 4: Skipping the recalibration check because "I'm almost done"
The recalibration check (Section D) is most valuable precisely when you feel you are "almost done" — because that feeling often means you are circling rather than converging. Run the check. It takes 2 minutes.

### Mistake 5: Applying this procedure to itself recursively
"How much effort should I spend deciding how much effort to spend?" The answer is: the triage takes under 60 seconds. That is the effort you spend. This procedure was designed to be self-limiting at the meta level. Do not recurse.

### Mistake 6: Assuming your initial effort-level assignment is correct
The triage gives you a starting point. It is deliberately rough. The Recalibration Check exists because roughly 20-30% of initial assignments are wrong. Always run Section D at least once during any Section B or C analysis.

### Mistake 7: Conflating "more options" with "better analysis"
Generating a 15th option is not analysis. In Section B, you are capped at 5 options. In Section C, you are capped at 10. These caps are not arbitrary — they reflect the empirical finding that decision quality does not improve beyond 5-7 options and often degrades due to choice overload.

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE

Override the procedure output and escalate to a higher effort level when:
- **You are deciding for others**: When your decision affects people who have no input, increase effort by one level as a duty of care.
- **The decision is public and permanent**: Published statements, signed contracts, public commitments — these have reputational permanence that may exceed their practical stakes.
- **You are in an unfamiliar domain**: Your intuition (which powers the triage and Section A) is unreliable in unfamiliar domains. Bump up one level when you are outside your expertise.
- **Multiple stakeholders disagree on stakes**: If someone affected by the decision says it is high-stakes and you think it is low-stakes, default to their assessment.

Override the procedure output and de-escalate to a lower effort level when:
- **You are the recognized expert**: In your domain of deep expertise, your pattern-matching is probably better than your analysis. Trust Section A more often.
- **The decision is genuinely time-sensitive**: If delay costs more than a suboptimal choice, compress to the fastest section that is viable. A decent decision made now beats a perfect decision made too late.
- **You have already made this decision before and it went fine**: Recurring decisions with a track record do not need re-analysis each time. Create a standing rule and use Section A to apply it.
- **You are in the last 20% of a project**: Late-stage decisions should be fast because the cost of delay now exceeds the cost of imperfection. Most remaining decisions are Section A.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Choosing a database for a new feature

**Context**: You are building a new feature that needs persistent storage. Your team already uses PostgreSQL. There are 3 viable options: PostgreSQL, a new NoSQL database, or a managed cloud service.

**Step 0 — Triage**:
- Q1: Coin flip acceptable? NO — a bad database choice causes weeks of migration pain.
- Q2: Care in 6 months? YES — you will live with this choice for the life of the feature.
- Q3: Easily reversible? Technically yes (can migrate), but expensive. Leaning NO.
- **Assignment: Section C (Maximum effort)**

**Recalibration at midpoint (Section D)**:
After 45 minutes of analysis, you realize: the data model is simple (key-value lookups), the scale is modest (< 1M records), and your team already knows PostgreSQL deeply. The "right" answer was obvious before you started — use PostgreSQL.

D3: "Is this effort level still correct?" NO — this is actually a Section A decision. The team's existing expertise and the simple data model make this a non-decision.

**Outcome**: Drop to Section A. Use PostgreSQL. Total time: 50 minutes (45 wasted, 5 useful). Lesson learned: for future decisions, check "is there an obvious default?" as a pre-triage step.

### Example 2: Responding to a customer complaint email

**Context**: A customer is upset about a delayed shipment. You need to decide what to offer: apology only, partial refund, full refund, or replacement with expedited shipping.

**Step 0 — Triage**:
- Q1: Coin flip acceptable? Almost — any genuine response is better than no response.
- Q2: Care in 6 months? NO.
- Q3: N/A — already trending Section A.
- **Assignment: Section A (Minimum effort)**

**Section A execution**:
- A1: "What to offer the customer with the delayed shipment."
- A2: Options: (1) Apology + 15% discount code, (2) Apology + replacement with expedited shipping, (3) Full refund.
- A3: Option 2 feels right — it solves their problem and retains the sale.
- A4: Send the email.

**Total time**: 90 seconds. Appropriate for the stakes.

### Example 3: Whether to accept a job offer

**Context**: You have one offer in hand. The role is interesting but requires relocating. The salary is 15% above your current. You have 5 days to decide.

**Step 0 — Triage**:
- Q1: Coin flip acceptable? Absolutely NOT.
- Q2: Care in 6 months? YES — this changes your daily life, social circle, career trajectory.
- Q3: Easily reversible? NO — you will uproot, sign a lease, start a new role. Reversal means quitting a new job and moving again.
- **Assignment: Section C (Maximum effort)**

**Section C execution (abbreviated)**:
- C1: "Accept or decline the offer. Deadline: 5 days. Key criteria: career growth, quality of daily life, financial impact."
- C2: Options: (1) Accept as offered, (2) Negotiate terms then accept, (3) Negotiate and include remote flexibility, (4) Decline and stay, (5) Decline and use the offer as leverage at current job, (6) Ask for a 2-week extension to decide.
- C3: Research focus — visit the city for a day, talk to 2 people at the company, calculate true cost-of-living difference.
- C4: Score options on the 3 criteria (career growth, quality of life, financial impact).
- C5: Stress test — strongest case against accepting: "You will lose your local network, the role might not match the job description, and the cost of living difference may eat the salary increase."
- C6: Pre-mortem — "I accepted, relocated, and 8 months later the team was reorganized and my role was eliminated. I am now unemployed in an unfamiliar city." Mitigation: negotiate a severance clause or a guaranteed minimum tenure clause.
- C7: Decision: Negotiate remote flexibility (Option 3). If remote flexibility is denied, request the 2-week extension (Option 6) and use the time to visit the city and have deeper conversations. Reversal trigger: if the team culture during deeper conversations reveals a pattern of turnover or mismanagement.
- C8: Send the negotiation email today.

**Total time**: ~6 hours across 3 days (research day, reflection day, decision day). Appropriate for the stakes.
