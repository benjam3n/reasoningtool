# Decision Procedure — Being a Good Employee

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: being a good employee

---

# GOOD EMPLOYEE PROCEDURE
=========================

**Who this is for**: Anyone employed in a professional role who wants a mechanical process for assessing and improving their performance. Works for individual contributors and people managers at any level below CEO.

**How to use**: Start at STEP 0. Follow the instructions. Every step tells you exactly what to do.

---

## STEP 0: What type of employee situation is this?

Answer these three questions:

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| **Role type?** | (A) Individual contributor — you produce work, (B) People manager — you lead a team, (C) Hybrid — you both produce and manage |
| **Career stage?** | (1) Early career / <3 years experience, (2) Mid-career / 3-10 years, (3) Senior / 10+ years or leadership level |
| **Current state?** | (X) Things are going fine, (Y) Something feels off but unclear what, (Z) Clear problem — bad review, PIP, conflict, or considering leaving |

**Your combination determines your section:**

| If... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Any Z (clear problem) | SECTION A: Triage Mode |
| Any 1 (early career) + X or Y | SECTION B: Foundation Building |
| A or C + 2 or 3 + X | SECTION C: IC Performance |
| B or C + 2 or 3 + X | SECTION D: Manager Performance |
| Any + Y (something off) | SECTION E: Diagnostic Mode |

---

## SECTION A: Triage Mode

*You're here because there's a specific, identifiable problem: bad performance review, performance improvement plan (PIP), interpersonal conflict, or you're actively considering quitting.*

**Step A1: Name the problem in one sentence.**
Write it: "The specific problem is [X], and if nothing changes, the consequence will be [Y] within [timeframe]."

Examples:
- "I received a 'needs improvement' review and will be put on a PIP if next quarter doesn't improve."
- "I have a conflict with my manager that's making me dread coming to work."
- "I'm considering quitting because of [specific reason]."

*If you can't write this sentence*: Your problem might be vaguer than you think. Go to SECTION E (Diagnostic Mode) instead.

**Step A2: Is this a "fix it" or "leave it" situation?**

Answer honestly:

| Question | YES | NO |
|---|---|---|
| Do I believe improvement is possible in this role/team/company? | → Keep going | → Go to Step A6 |
| Is my manager willing to work with me on this? | → Keep going | → Go to Step A5 |
| Am I willing to change my behavior to address the feedback? | → Keep going | → Go to Step A6 |

If all YES → Step A3. Any single NO is informative — follow the redirect.

**Step A3: Create a 30-day action plan.**

Based on the feedback you've received (from your review, PIP document, or direct conversation):

1. List the **specific behaviors** that need to change. Not "be more proactive" — instead: "Send weekly status email to manager by Friday EOD" or "Complete code reviews within 24 hours."
2. For each behavior, define what "success" looks like in observable terms.
3. Set a weekly check-in with your manager: "Here's what I did this week toward [specific change]. Am I on track?"

*What you should see*: Your manager responds positively to the check-ins. If they're dismissive or the goalposts keep moving, note this — it's diagnostic (go to A5).

**Step A4: 30-day checkpoint.**
After 30 days, answer:
- Has the feedback improved? Ask directly: "Am I making progress on [the issues]?"
- Do I feel better or worse about the situation?
- Is my manager acknowledging improvement?

If improving → continue for another 30 days, then reassess.
If not improving despite genuine effort → Go to Step A5.

**Step A5: The manager/environment problem.**
If improvement isn't happening despite effort, consider:
- Request a skip-level conversation (meeting with your manager's manager). Frame it as: "I want to make sure I'm interpreting feedback correctly and working on the right things."
- If HR is accessible, ask for coaching resources.
- If neither is available or helpful → Go to Step A6.

**Step A6: The exit evaluation.**
Before leaving, verify:
- Have I given the situation a genuine shot (minimum 60 days of targeted effort)?
- Is the problem the specific role/manager, or would it follow me? (If it's happened at multiple jobs, it may be something you carry.)
- Do I have a financial runway to transition? (Minimum 3 months expenses saved before voluntary departure.)
- Can I transition internally first? (Different team, different manager.)

If you've answered these honestly and leaving is still the answer: begin job search while employed. Don't quit without something lined up unless your health requires it.

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Rage-quitting without a plan. Even a terrible job is better endured for 60-90 more days while you conduct a proper search.

---

## SECTION B: Foundation Building (Early Career)

*You're here because you're in the first 3 years of your career. The rules are different for you — your primary job is to learn, build credibility, and establish professional habits.*

**Step B1: Understand your actual job.**
Schedule a 30-minute conversation with your manager. Ask exactly these questions:
1. "What are the top 3 things you need from me this quarter?"
2. "How will you evaluate my performance? What does 'exceeds expectations' look like?"
3. "What's the most common mistake people in my role make?"

Write down the answers. These are your operating instructions.

*If your manager can't answer clearly*: That's not your fault, but it is your problem. Write what YOU think the answers are, email them to your manager, and say: "I want to make sure I'm focused on the right things — does this look right?"

**Step B2: Build the reliability habit.**
For the next 90 days, follow this rule without exception:

> **Never commit to a deadline you can't meet. If a deadline is at risk, communicate 48 hours before, not after.**

Mechanically:
- When given a task, estimate how long it will take. Multiply by 1.5 (you're early career — you underestimate). That's your commitment.
- Every Wednesday, review all open commitments. For any at risk: send an update. "I committed to X by Friday. Current status is Y. I expect to deliver [on time / by new date] because [reason]."

*What you should see after 90 days*: People describe you as "reliable" or "someone you can count on." If not, your estimates are still off — increase the multiplier.

**Step B3: Learn the unwritten rules.**
Every organization has rules that aren't documented. Find someone 2-5 years ahead of you (not your manager) and ask:
1. "What do people who get promoted here actually do differently?"
2. "What are the unspoken rules I should know?"
3. "What mistake did you make early on that you'd help me avoid?"

One conversation like this per quarter. Different person each time.

**Step B4: Make your work visible without being annoying.**
Follow this formula:
- **Weekly**: Send your manager a brief end-of-week update. Three bullets: what you completed, what you're working on next, anything blocking you.
- **Monthly**: In your 1:1, highlight one accomplishment you're proud of. Not bragging — informing: "I wanted to make sure you knew about [specific thing] because [why it mattered]."
- **Quarterly**: Ask your manager: "Is there anything I've done that you didn't know about?" The answer tells you if your visibility is working.

**Step B5: Quality calibration.**
You don't yet know what "good" looks like in your organization. Fix this:
- Find examples of work rated as excellent in your role. Study them. What makes them good?
- After completing a piece of work, before submitting it, ask yourself: "Would [the best person in this role] be satisfied with this?" If you don't know, ask a peer to review.
- When you receive feedback, don't just fix the specific item — identify the *pattern*. "My manager corrected my analysis because I didn't account for edge cases" means: add an edge case check to ALL your analyses, not just this one.

**Step B6: Monthly self-check (10 minutes, last Friday of month).**

| Question | Y/N | If NO |
|---|---|---|
| Can I state my top 3 priorities? | | Revisit Step B1 |
| Did I miss any commitments this month? | | Revisit Step B2 |
| Did I learn something new about how this org works? | | Schedule a Step B3 conversation |
| Does my manager know my key accomplishments? | | Revisit Step B4 |
| Am I getting less corrective feedback than last month? | | Revisit Step B5 |
| Am I enjoying this enough to keep going? | | Honest check — is this role, career, or energy? |

---

## SECTION C: Individual Contributor Performance

*You're here because you're a mid-to-senior IC and things are generally working. Your job is sustained excellence and career development.*

**Step C1: Quarterly performance audit (45 minutes, once per quarter).**

Score yourself honestly on each dimension. Use evidence, not feeling:

| Dimension | Score | Evidence | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Output quality**: Is my work at or above the level expected for my role? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Reliability**: Am I meeting all commitments? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Manager relationship**: Does my manager trust me and know what I'm doing? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Collaboration**: Do peers want to work with me? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Communication**: Are the right people informed at the right time? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Initiative**: Do I solve problems or escalate/stall? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Development**: Am I learning and growing? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |
| **Impact awareness**: Can I articulate how my work contributed to business outcomes? | _/5 | | ↑↓→ |

*Scoring guide*: 1 = significant gap, 2 = below expectations, 3 = meets expectations, 4 = exceeds, 5 = top 10% in this dimension.

**Step C2: Identify your performance bottleneck.**
Your lowest score is your bottleneck — the thing most limiting your overall perceived performance.

*Critical rule*: Don't try to improve everything. Pick the ONE lowest dimension and focus there for the next quarter. Exception: if Ethical Conduct is below 5, that's always the priority.

**Step C3: Intervention by bottleneck type.**

| If lowest dimension is... | Action |
|---|---|
| Output quality | Get specific: ask manager or senior peer to review 3 pieces of recent work and identify exactly where quality gaps are. Create a checklist from their feedback. Apply to all future work. |
| Reliability | Audit your commitment system. Are you tracking all promises? Are you estimating accurately? Implement: one tracking system (even a simple list), 1.3x multiplier on all estimates, Wednesday commitment review. |
| Manager relationship | Schedule a reset conversation: "I want to make sure we're aligned. What do you most need from me? What's the best way for me to keep you informed?" Then DO what they say for 30 days. |
| Collaboration | Ask 3 peers privately: "What's one thing I could do that would make me easier to work with?" Act on the most common answer. |
| Communication | Implement a structured update rhythm: weekly written update to manager, proactive updates to stakeholders on anything they're waiting on. |
| Initiative | Next time you encounter a problem, before asking for help: spend 30 minutes attempting a solution. Then present: "Here's the problem, here's what I tried, here's what I recommend. Does that make sense?" |
| Development | Identify ONE skill that would most increase your value in the next 12 months. Spend 2-4 hours/week on it. Tell your manager — they may be able to create opportunities. |
| Impact awareness | For every major deliverable, write one sentence: "This contributed to [business outcome] by [mechanism]." Keep a running list. Use it in performance reviews. |

**Step C4: The senior IC trap — check for it annually.**
If you've been in the same role 3+ years, answer:
- Am I still learning at a meaningful rate? If no, you're plateauing.
- Could a less experienced person do 80% of my job? If yes, you're underleveled for your capability.
- Do I know what the next role/level looks like? If no, find out.
- Am I being paid at market rate? If you haven't checked in 2 years, check.

If 2+ answers are concerning: have a career conversation with your manager. If your manager can't or won't help, talk to a mentor or recruiter.

**Step C5: Weekly habits (build these until they're automatic).**

| Habit | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| Priority check | Monday morning | "What are my top 3 deliverables this week?" Write them down. |
| Commitment review | Wednesday | "Am I on track for everything I've promised?" If not, communicate NOW. |
| Visibility update | Friday | Brief update to manager (or skip if you have a Monday 1:1 where you'll cover it). |
| Relationship investment | Anytime | One genuine interaction per week with someone outside your immediate team — help with something, share something useful, ask about their work. |

## SECTION D: Manager Performance

*You're here because you manage people and things are generally working. Your job is to make your team effective while meeting organizational goals.*

**Step D1: The manager's actual job (recalibrate quarterly).**

Your job is NOT to do the work. Your job is:
1. **Clarity**: Does every person on your team know what they're supposed to deliver and how it's measured?
2. **Enablement**: Are obstacles removed so your team can work effectively?
3. **Development**: Is each person growing?
4. **Accountability**: Are you addressing underperformance, not ignoring it?
5. **Upward communication**: Does YOUR manager trust your team is on track?

If you're spending more than 25% of your time on individual contributor work, you're not doing your actual job.

**Step D2: Monthly team health check (30 minutes).**

| Dimension | Score | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Does every team member know their top 3 priorities? | _/5 | Ask 2 random team members. Can they state them without looking? |
| Is the team delivering on commitments? | _/5 | Track: what % of commitments were met this month? |
| Are 1:1s happening and useful? | _/5 | Ask: "Are our 1:1s useful to you? What would make them better?" |
| Is anyone at risk of leaving (who you don't want to lose)? | _/5 | Watch for: disengagement, reduced communication, visible frustration |
| Am I giving enough feedback? | _/5 | Check: have you given specific, actionable feedback to each person this month? |
| Is underperformance being addressed? | _/5 | If someone has been underperforming for >60 days without a documented conversation, the answer is NO. |

**Step D3: The manager's ethical obligations.**
Non-negotiable:
- Never take credit for your team's work. Always attribute specifically.
- Never throw a team member under the bus to your management. You own your team's failures upward; your team owns their specific failures to you.
- If you learn something that affects your team's jobs or wellbeing, share it as soon as you're allowed to.
- If a team member raises an ethical concern, act on it. Don't absorb it and do nothing.

**Step D4: Quarterly career conversation with each direct report.**
Separate from performance feedback. Ask:
1. "Where do you want to be in 2 years?"
2. "What skills do you need to build to get there?"
3. "What can I do — or stop doing — to help?"

Then actually follow through. Write down what you committed to. Review it next quarter.

**Step D5: Managing up — your relationship with YOUR manager.**
Your manager needs from you:
- **No surprises**: Bad news early, good news regularly.
- **Solutions, not just problems**: "Here's an issue, here's my recommendation."
- **A team they don't have to worry about**: If your manager is frequently intervening in your team, something is wrong.

Monthly: "Here's what my team delivered, here's what's next, here are the risks I'm watching."

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE for managers**: Spending all time on your team and none on your own performance, development, and upward relationships. Your effectiveness as a manager depends on your effectiveness as an employee of your own manager.

## SECTION E: Diagnostic Mode

*You're here because something feels off but you can't pinpoint what. This section helps you identify the actual problem.*

**Step E1: The symptom inventory.**
Check all that apply:

| Category | Symptom | ✓ |
|---|---|---|
| **Energy** | I dread going to work most days | |
| **Energy** | I'm exhausted even when workload is normal | |
| **Energy** | I've stopped caring about quality | |
| **Clarity** | I'm not sure what I should be working on | |
| **Clarity** | I feel busy but not productive | |
| **Clarity** | I can't tell if I'm doing well or poorly | |
| **Relationship** | I avoid my manager | |
| **Relationship** | I feel excluded from decisions that affect me | |
| **Relationship** | I have unresolved conflict with a colleague | |
| **Growth** | I'm bored | |
| **Growth** | I've stopped learning | |
| **Growth** | I don't see a path forward here | |
| **Values** | I'm being asked to do things I disagree with | |
| **Values** | The company's actions don't match its stated values | |
| **Values** | I'm compromising my standards and it bothers me | |

**Step E2: Categorize the dominant pattern.**

Count your checks per category:
- Most checks in **Energy** → Go to Step E3
- Most checks in **Clarity** → Go to Step E4
- Most checks in **Relationship** → Go to Step E5
- Most checks in **Growth** → Go to Step E6
- Most checks in **Values** → Go to Step E7
- Checks spread evenly → Go to Step E8

**Step E3: Energy problem.**
This is about sustainability, not motivation. Ask:
- Am I sleeping 7+ hours? Exercising? Seeing people I care about?
  - If NO to any → fix the basics first. Seriously. Performance cannot improve on depleted health.
- Is the workload objectively unreasonable (>50 hrs/week consistently)?
  - If YES → talk to your manager: "I need to prioritize — here's everything on my plate. Which 3 matter most?" If they say "all of them," escalate or set your own boundaries.
- Is it the work itself or the environment?
  - Work itself → SECTION E6 (Growth)
  - Environment → SECTION E5 (Relationship)

**Step E4: Clarity problem.**
You don't know what to work on or how to measure success. Fix this directly:
1. Write down what you THINK your top 3 priorities are.
2. Show your manager: "Here's what I think I should focus on. Is this right?"
3. If they agree → you now have clarity. Execute.
4. If they disagree → ask them to state their version. Write it down.
5. If they can't articulate it → you have a manager problem, not a clarity problem. Go to E5.

**Step E5: Relationship problem.**
Identify the specific relationship:
- **Manager**: Request a candid 1:1. "I want to improve our working relationship. Can you tell me one thing I should do differently?" If they engage → work on it. If they dismiss → consider: skip-level conversation, internal transfer, or exit evaluation (Section A, Step A6).
- **Colleague**: Address it directly within 1 week. "I've noticed some tension between us. I'd like to clear the air. Can we talk?" If direct conversation fails → involve your manager.
- **General exclusion**: This may be political. Find an ally 1-2 levels up who can give you honest feedback about your standing.

**Step E6: Growth problem.**
You're bored or plateauing:
1. Is there a role at this company that would excite you? If YES → tell your manager you're interested in transitioning. Ask what you'd need to develop.
2. If NO → begin exploring externally. But first: are you bored with the role, the company, or the field? The answer determines whether you need a new job, a new company, or a new career.
3. In the meantime: volunteer for a stretch project, mentor someone junior, or take on a cross-functional initiative. This buys time while you figure out the bigger question.

**Step E7: Values problem.**
This is serious. Distinguish between:
- **Minor disagreement**: "I'd do it differently but the approach isn't wrong." → Tolerable. Adjust expectations.
- **Real ethical concern**: "This could harm someone, break a law, or violate professional standards." → Document it. Report through appropriate channels (manager, HR, ethics hotline, legal). If the organization won't address it, consider whether you can remain associated with this.
- **Culture mismatch**: "The values here just don't match mine." → This won't improve. Begin exit planning.

**Step E8: Everything is off.**
When problems span all categories, it's usually one of two things:
1. **Burnout**: You've been running too hard for too long. Everything feels bad because you're depleted. → Fix energy FIRST (E3). Reassess in 30 days.
2. **Wrong fit**: The role, company, or career is wrong for you. → Have an honest conversation with a trusted advisor outside the company. Not a friend who'll validate you — someone who'll challenge you.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The Weekly Employee Checklist
- [ ] Do I know my top 3 priorities for this week?
- [ ] Am I on track for all commitments? If not, have I communicated?
- [ ] Has my manager heard from me this week (update, question, or flag)?
- [ ] Did I help someone outside my immediate responsibilities?
- [ ] Did I learn something — even something small?

### Card 2: The Difficult Conversation Starter Kit
When you need to raise something uncomfortable:

**With your manager about unclear expectations:**
"I want to make sure I'm focused on the right things. Can we spend 10 minutes aligning on my top priorities?"

**With your manager about feedback:**
"I want to keep improving. Can you give me one specific thing I should work on?"

**With a colleague about conflict:**
"I've noticed we're not on the same page about [specific thing]. I'd like to understand your perspective. Can we talk for 15 minutes?"

**With your manager about burnout:**
"I want to keep delivering at a high level, but my current workload isn't sustainable. Can we look at what to prioritize and what to defer?"

### Card 3: Performance Review Preparation
Before any review:
1. List your top 5 accomplishments since last review, with IMPACT (not just activity).
2. For each, quantify if possible: "Reduced X by Y%" or "Delivered Z which enabled [business outcome]."
3. Prepare 1-2 areas you're actively developing (shows self-awareness).
4. Prepare 1 thing you need from your manager/organization.

### Card 4: The "Am I About to Get Fired?" Checklist
Warning signs (3+ = take action immediately):
- [ ] Manager has become noticeably distant or formal
- [ ] You've been excluded from meetings you used to attend
- [ ] Your responsibilities have been quietly redistributed
- [ ] You received a written warning or "documented conversation"
- [ ] Your manager avoids giving you new projects
- [ ] HR has scheduled a meeting with you and your manager

If 3+ apply: Update your resume today. Begin networking this week. Consider asking your manager directly: "I'm sensing a change. Can you help me understand where I stand?"

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Confusing being busy with being effective.** Working 12-hour days on low-priority tasks is worse than working 6 hours on the right thing. Measure outcomes, not hours.

2. **Avoiding your manager.** The employees who struggle most are the ones who hide from feedback. Your manager can't help you if they don't know what's happening.

3. **Waiting for instructions.** At every level above entry, waiting to be told what to do is underperformance. If you're unsure, propose something: "I think I should do X. Does that sound right?"

4. **Assuming good work speaks for itself.** It doesn't. You need to make your contributions visible — not through self-promotion, but through regular communication that demonstrates impact.

5. **Ignoring peer relationships.** Your manager's opinion is shaped partly by what they hear from your colleagues. Being brilliant but difficult to work with caps your trajectory.

6. **Neglecting your health for your job.** No job is worth your physical or mental health. If you're sacrificing sleep, exercise, or relationships for 6+ months, the job is eating you and something must change.

7. **Staying too long in a bad situation.** If you've been unhappy for 6+ months and nothing has improved despite effort, the situation probably won't change. Start planning your exit.

8. **Comparing yourself to others instead of to your goals.** "Am I better than my peers?" is the wrong question. "Am I on track toward my goals?" is the right one.

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

Seek outside help when:

- **You're being harassed, discriminated against, or asked to do something illegal.** Don't follow a self-improvement procedure. Contact HR, legal counsel, or relevant regulatory authorities.
- **You're dealing with a mental health crisis.** Performance optimization is irrelevant if you're in crisis. Seek professional support first.
- **You've been through 2+ cycles of Section A (Triage) at different companies.** The common factor may be something a career coach or therapist can help identify.
- **You're in a highly specialized field** (medicine, law, academia, creative arts) where career dynamics have unique structures. Seek field-specific mentorship.
- **Your company is failing/dysfunctional.** No amount of personal improvement compensates for a sinking ship. Focus on exit planning.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Mid-career software engineer, things are fine

**Step 0**: Role = A (IC), Career stage = 2 (mid), State = X (fine) → **SECTION C: IC Performance**

**Step C1 (Quarterly audit)**:
| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Output quality | 4/5 | Code reviews pass with minor comments; shipped 2 features on time |
| Reliability | 4/5 | Met all deadlines this quarter |
| Manager relationship | 3/5 | 1:1s happen but are mostly status updates |
| Collaboration | 4/5 | Frequently asked to pair with junior devs |
| Communication | 2/5 | Manager was surprised by a delayed feature — I didn't flag the risk early enough |
| Initiative | 4/5 | Proposed and implemented a build time optimization |
| Development | 3/5 | Haven't learned anything new in 6 months |
| Impact awareness | 2/5 | Couldn't articulate business impact of my work in last review |

**Step C2**: Lowest scores are Communication (2) and Impact awareness (2). Communication is more fundamental — it affects visibility and trust.

**Step C3**: Implement structured update rhythm. Weekly written update to manager. Proactive flag on any commitment at risk by Wednesday.

After one quarter: Communication score rises to 4/5. Impact awareness still at 2/5 — becomes next quarter's focus.

### Example 2: Junior marketing coordinator, 8 months in, something feels off

**Step 0**: Role = A (IC), Career stage = 1 (early), State = Y (something off) → **SECTION E: Diagnostic Mode**

**Step E1 (Symptom inventory)**:
- ✓ I feel busy but not productive (Clarity)
- ✓ I can't tell if I'm doing well or poorly (Clarity)
- ✓ I'm not sure what I should be working on (Clarity)
- ✓ I'm exhausted even when workload is normal (Energy)

**Step E2**: Most checks in Clarity → Step E4.

**Step E4**:
1. Writes down what she thinks her top 3 priorities are: social media posts, event logistics, email campaigns.
2. Shows manager. Manager says: "Actually, I need you focused on lead generation metrics and campaign ROI reporting. The social media stuff is secondary."
3. Complete misalignment discovered. Now she has clarity.

Returns to **SECTION B** (Foundation Building) for ongoing habits.

### Example 3: Experienced manager, team is underperforming

**Step 0**: Role = B (manager), Career stage = 3 (senior), State = Y (something off) → **SECTION E: Diagnostic Mode**

**Step E1 (Symptom inventory)**:
- ✓ I feel busy but not productive (Clarity)
- ✓ I dread going to work most days (Energy)
- ✓ I avoid my manager (Relationship)

Split across categories → **Step E8**. Likely burnout — has been in high-pressure turnaround for 14 months.

**Step E3**: Sleep is 5 hours. No exercise. No social life. → Fix basics first. Sets non-negotiable: 7 hours sleep, 3x/week exercise, one social commitment per week. Delegates two projects to senior team members.

Reassess in 30 days. Energy improves. Clarity and relationship problems diminish — they were symptoms of burnout, not independent problems.

Returns to **SECTION D** (Manager Performance) for ongoing cadence.

**Validation status**: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts. It synthesizes common workplace performance frameworks but should be supplemented with mentorship and organizational context.
