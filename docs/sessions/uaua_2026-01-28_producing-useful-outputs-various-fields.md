  - Start from "what does field X need?" then find which skill chain produces it

  ASSUME RIGHT (this is the best first output type):                                                                                                                                    
  - L1: The DE master procedure you just made was genuinely useful — it takes expert knowledge and makes it mechanical                                                                  
  - L2: This format works because it transforms understanding into execution                                                                                                            
  - L3: Every field has decisions that experts navigate intuitively but novices struggle with                                                                                           
  - L4: A well-made procedure is useful to anyone in that field regardless of skill level                                                                                               
  - L5: Procedures are shareable, testable, and improvable                                                                                                                              
  - L6: They demonstrate GOSM's value concretely — "here's what it produced"                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ASSUME WRONG (this approach fails):                                                                                                                                                   
  - L1: Not every field's decisions can be reduced to mechanical procedures                                                                                                             
  - L2: Fields with high ambiguity (art, strategy) resist proceduralization                                                                                                             
  - L3: Procedures without domain validation could be wrong and harmful                                                                                                                 
  - L4: BUT: the procedure format itself flags uncertainty — "if X, try Y; if not, try Z"                                                                                               
  - L5: The DE procedure worked because you could verify correctness against known solutions                                                                                            
  - L6: For softer fields, the procedure becomes a structured thinking guide rather than an algorithm                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  VERDICT: VALIDATED — Best first output type. Works across rigidity spectrum (algorithm → structured guide)

  ASSUME RIGHT:                                                                                                                                                                         
  - L1: Every field has unquestioned assumptions that ARAW can surface                                                                                                                  
  - L2: "What does your field assume that might be wrong?" is universally valuable                                                                                                      
  - L3: This is what the essay describes — and GOSM can actually do it systematically                                                                                                   
  - L4: A 90+ page ARAW audit of a field's core beliefs would be unprecedented                                                                                                          
  - L5: The format (ASSUME RIGHT / ASSUME WRONG) makes bias explicit

  ASSUME WRONG:                                                                                                                                                                         
  - L1: Without domain expertise, the audit might surface only obvious objections                                                                                                       
  - L2: Experts would dismiss it as "outsider doesn't understand the nuance"                                                                                                            
  - L3: BUT: the outsider perspective IS the value — fresh eyes on embedded assumptions                                                                                                 
  - L4: The audit should be framed as "questions to investigate" not "you're wrong"

  1. Field has no clear decision structure — e.g., art, creative writing → Use as structured thinking guide not algorithm                                                               
  2. Procedure is wrong — No domain expert validated it → Include "validation status: unvalidated" marker                                                                               
  3. Procedure becomes outdated — Field changes → Version and date all procedures                                                                                                       
  4. User follows procedure mechanically without judgment → Include "when to override" section                                                                                          
  5. Liability risk — Medical/legal procedures followed blindly → Strong disclaimers + "consult professional"                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For VALIDATED: Assumption Audits                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  6. Field has already addressed the assumption — ARAW rediscovers known debate → Research existing discourse first                                                                     
  7. Assumptions are value-laden — "Should healthcare be profit-driven?" isn't testable → Separate empirical assumptions from value assumptions                                         
  8. Experts dismiss outsider analysis → Frame as "questions for practitioners" not conclusions                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For VALIDATED: Cross-Domain Insights                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  9. Analogy is superficially attractive but structurally wrong → ARAW each analogy explicitly                                                                                          
  10. Both fields already know about each other → Check for existing cross-pollination literature

  11. Audience doesn't understand GOSM terminology → Outputs should be readable without knowing GOSM                                                                                    
  12.

  - Key insight: Outputs should be useful WITHOUT knowledge of GOSM. The procedure user doesn't need to know about ARAW — they just follow the steps.                                   
  - Key insight: Every output needs a "validation status" — unvalidated (GOSM-generated), expert-reviewed, field-tested                                                                 
  - Key insight: The best first outputs are in fields where YOU have domain knowledge to validate                                                                                       
  - Key insight: Outputs should embed the ARAW structure invisibly — the "if X doesn't work, try Y because Z assumption might be wrong" pattern is ARAW without the label

  Want me to start producing the first output — the "Why Software Estimation Is Always Wrong" assumption audit? I'd run it through the full chain: assumption_extraction →              
  assumption_inversion → araw 8x → cross_domain_analogy → insight_synthesis.
