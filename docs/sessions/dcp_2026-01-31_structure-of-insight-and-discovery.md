# Decision Procedure — The Structure of Insight and Discovery

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: the structure of insight and discovery

---

## Step 1: Discover Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

What dimensions determine whether insight and discovery actually happen vs. not?

**Dimension 1: Problem Representation**
How the problem is encoded in the mind. The same problem stated differently yields different insights. Matters because the representation determines which connections are accessible.

**Dimension 2: Prior Knowledge Activation**
Which existing knowledge gets brought to bear. Insight requires the right pieces to be active in memory simultaneously. Matters because the raw material of insight is recombined experience.

**Dimension 3: Search Strategy**
Whether exploration is directed (hypothesis-driven), undirected (wandering), or oscillating between the two. Matters because pure direction misses surprises and pure wandering never converges.

**Dimension 4: Constraint Relaxation**
Whether current assumptions about the problem are loosened or held fixed. Insight almost always requires dropping a constraint that seemed mandatory. Matters because the "stuck" state is usually a constraint problem, not a knowledge problem.

**Dimension 5: Incubation Conditions**
What happens during periods of not-actively-working. The unconscious processing that reorganizes problem elements. Matters because forced conscious search often blocks the reorganization that produces insight.

**Dimension 6: Analogy Distance**
How far afield the solver looks for structural matches. Near analogies refine; distant analogies transform. Matters because breakthrough insights almost always import structure from a different domain.

**Dimension 7: Feedback Quality**
Whether the environment tells you when you're getting warmer or colder. Some domains give fast, clear feedback; others give none. Matters because discovery without feedback degenerates into speculation.

**Dimension 8: Emotional State**
The solver's affective condition — frustration, curiosity, playfulness, anxiety. Matters because positive-expansive states widen associative reach while negative-narrow states improve focus on known paths.

**Dimension 9: Social Configuration**
Alone, in a pair, in a group, or alternating. Matters because different configurations excel at different phases (generation vs. evaluation vs. integration).

**Dimension 10: Surprise Recognition**
The ability to notice when something doesn't fit the current model, rather than explaining it away. Matters because most discoveries begin with anomalies that others dismissed.

**Dimension 11: Formalization Timing**
When you move from intuition to explicit statement. Too early kills the insight; too late loses it. Matters because premature formalization freezes the wrong frame.

**Dimension 12: Iteration Depth**
How many cycles of generate-test-revise occur. Single-pass thinking rarely produces insight. Matters because insight typically emerges on the 3rd+ reformulation of a problem.

## Step 2: Enumerate Options per Dimension (`/se`)

**D1 — Problem Representation**
- Verbal/propositional (stated in words)
- Visual/spatial (diagrams, maps, sketches)
- Formal/mathematical (equations, logic)
- Embodied/enactive (physical manipulation, gesture)
- Narrative (told as a story with characters and causation)
- Multiple simultaneous representations

**D2 — Prior Knowledge Activation**
- Narrow domain expertise only
- Adjacent domain knowledge
- Distant/unrelated domain knowledge
- First-principles (physics-style reasoning from axioms)
- Experiential/tacit (pattern recognition from lived experience)
- Deliberately randomized priming (expose yourself to unrelated material)

**D3 — Search Strategy**
- Pure exploitation (follow the best current lead)
- Pure exploration (sample randomly)
- Epsilon-greedy (mostly exploit, occasionally explore)
- Oscillating (scheduled switches between explore and exploit)
- Problem-driven (let the stuck-point determine what to try)
- Question-driven (generate questions, let them pull you)

**D4 — Constraint Relaxation**
- Hold all constraints fixed (work within the box)
- Relax one constraint at a time (systematic)
- Invert a constraint (what if the opposite were true?)
- Drop all constraints temporarily (blue-sky)
- Challenge the problem statement itself (is this the right question?)

**D5 — Incubation Conditions**
- No break (continuous effort)
- Short breaks with unrelated activity
- Sleep on it (overnight incubation)
- Extended break (days/weeks away)
- Low-demand related activity (walking, showering while loosely thinking)
- Active distraction (deliberately fill working memory with something else)

**D6 — Analogy Distance**
- Within-domain (same field, similar problem)
- Adjacent-domain (related field)
- Distant-domain (unrelated field, structural match)
- Cross-species/cross-era (how does nature / history solve this?)
- Abstract-structural (pure pattern matching stripped of content)

**D7 — Feedback Quality**
- Immediate and precise (you know exactly what's wrong)
- Delayed but clear (results come later but are unambiguous)
- Ambiguous (signal mixed with noise)
- Absent (no feedback available; must self-evaluate)
- Self-constructed (build your own tests/experiments)

**D8 — Emotional State**
- Curious-playful (expansive, associative)
- Frustrated-determined (narrowing, intensifying)
- Calm-detached (observational, non-reactive)
- Anxious-pressured (deadline-driven)
- Bored-restless (seeking novelty)

**D9 — Social Configuration**
- Solo with no input
- Solo with asynchronous input (reading, correspondence)
- Pair (real-time dialogue with one other)
- Small group (3-6, structured discussion)
- Large group / crowd (many perspectives, low coordination)
- Alternating solo ↔ group

**D10 — Surprise Recognition**
- Dismiss anomalies (explain away)
- Note but defer (log it, continue current path)
- Investigate immediately (drop everything)
- Collect anomalies systematically (build a list, look for patterns)
- Actively seek anomalies (design experiments to produce surprises)

**D11 — Formalization Timing**
- Formalize immediately (write it down precisely as soon as it appears)
- Hold in intuition until it stabilizes (wait for clarity)
- Partial formalization (sketch, don't lock)
- Formalize only when communicating to others
- Oscillate (formalize, then de-formalize to stay flexible)

**D12 — Iteration Depth**
- Single pass (think once, output)
- Two passes (draft and revise)
- Three+ passes (multiple reformulations)
- Until convergence (keep going until no new changes)
- Until surprise (keep going until something unexpected emerges)

**Key interactions**:
- If D3=pure exploitation AND D4=hold all constraints → almost never produces insight
- If D6=distant AND D2=narrow expertise only → analogies can't land (no receiving structure)
- If D8=anxious AND D5=no break → blocks incubation entirely
- If D10=dismiss anomalies → D12 depth is irrelevant (you'll converge on the wrong answer)

## Step 3: Surface Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

The standard approach to "having an insight" assumes:

**A1: Insight is an event, not a process.** People expect a lightning-bolt moment. Reality: insight is the *visible phase transition* of a long accumulation process. The procedure must address the accumulation, not just the moment.

**A2: More thinking = more insight.** The default is to try harder in the same mode. Reality: insight usually requires *switching modes* — different representation, different constraints, different emotional state. Effort in the wrong mode actively prevents insight.

**A3: The problem is correctly stated.** People assume the question they're asking is the right question. Reality: most stuck states come from solving the wrong problem. The procedure must include problem-reformulation steps.

**A4: Expertise is always helpful.** Deep domain knowledge is assumed to be strictly positive. Reality: expertise creates functional fixedness — you see things the way your field sees them. The procedure must include deliberate de-expertise moves.

**A5: Insights are fragile and must be captured immediately.** People fear losing the idea. Reality: robust insights can be re-derived. If you can't reconstruct it, it probably wasn't solid. The procedure should test insight stability.

**A6: Individual thinking is the default unit.** People assume insight happens in one mind. Reality: many breakthroughs come from collision between different minds' representations. The procedure must include social configurations.

**A7: You'll recognize the insight when it arrives.** People assume insight is self-announcing. Reality: many insights are initially experienced as confusion, discomfort, or "that can't be right." The procedure must include criteria for recognizing disguised insight.

**A8: The insight needs to be novel to the world.** People conflate personal discovery with global novelty. Reality: rediscovering something independently often produces deeper understanding than being told. The procedure should be agnostic about novelty.

## Step 4: Generate the Procedure (`/stg`)

```
INSIGHT AND DISCOVERY PROCEDURE
================================

PURPOSE: Take someone from "I'm working on something and want to
have genuine insights" to either having them or knowing why they
haven't arrived yet.

DEFINITIONS:
- "Insight": A reorganization of your understanding that makes
  something previously confusing become clear, or reveals a
  connection you didn't see before.
- "Discovery": Finding something true that you didn't know,
  through your own process rather than being told.
- "Stuck": You've been working and nothing new is emerging.

================================================================
STEP 0: What phase are you in?
================================================================

Read all three. Pick the one that fits best.

(A) I have a specific problem and I'm stuck on it.
    → Go to SECTION A: UNSTICKING

(B) I'm exploring a domain and want to find something interesting.
    → Go to SECTION B: EXPLORATION

(C) I had a partial insight and want to develop it fully.
    → Go to SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION

================================================================
SECTION A: UNSTICKING
================================================================

You have a problem. You've been working on it. You're not making
progress. The goal is to break the impasse.

Step A1: Write down your current approach in one sentence.
  Example: "I'm trying to reduce server costs by optimizing
  database queries."
  What you should see: A clear statement of WHAT you're doing
  and HOW you're doing it.

Step A2: Write down what would count as "solved."
  Example: "Server costs drop below $500/month without
  degrading response times."
  What you should see: A concrete, testable outcome.

Step A3: List every assumption in your A1 sentence.
  Go word by word. Each noun and verb hides an assumption.
  "reduce" assumes the number should go down (not be
  restructured). "server costs" assumes the cost unit is the
  server (not the query, not the feature, not the user).
  "optimizing" assumes the current approach is right and needs
  tuning (not replacement). "database queries" assumes the
  database is the bottleneck (not the architecture).
  Target: At least 5 assumptions. If you found fewer, you're
  not looking hard enough — reread your sentence.

Step A4: For each assumption, write the opposite.
  "Reduce costs" → "What if costs should increase in some
  areas to decrease elsewhere?"
  "Database queries are the problem" → "What if the database
  is fine and the problem is elsewhere?"
  What you should see: Statements that feel slightly wrong
  or uncomfortable. That discomfort is signal.

Step A5: Which inverted assumption feels most uncomfortable?
  Pick ONE. The one that makes you think "no, that can't be
  right" the strongest.
  ⚠️ WARNING: If none feel uncomfortable, you haven't
  inverted deeply enough. Return to A4.

Step A6: Spend exactly 10 minutes exploring the uncomfortable
  inversion AS IF it were true. Don't evaluate it. Just follow
  its implications.
  Write continuously. Don't stop to judge.
  What you should see: After 5-7 minutes, a moment where you
  think "wait, actually..." or "huh, that's interesting."

Step A7: Did a new angle emerge?
  YES → Go to SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION with the new angle.
  NO → Go to Step A8.

Step A8: Change your representation.
  If you've been thinking in words → draw a picture.
  If you've been using diagrams → write a story where the
  components are characters.
  If you've been formal/mathematical → explain it to an
  imaginary 10-year-old using only physical analogies.
  If you've been building → step back and describe what
  you see as if you're a journalist visiting for the first
  time.
  Spend 15 minutes in the new representation.

Step A9: Did a new angle emerge?
  YES → Go to SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION.
  NO → Go to Step A10.

Step A10: STOP WORKING. Do something physically active and
  completely unrelated for at least 30 minutes. Walking,
  exercise, cooking, cleaning. NOT reading, NOT scrolling,
  NOT "relaxing while thinking about it."
  Your only task during this break: if any thought about the
  problem surfaces, notice it and let it pass. Don't grab it.

Step A11: After the break, before doing anything else, write
  the FIRST thing that comes to mind about the problem.
  Don't filter. Don't judge. Write it raw.
  What you should see: Often something different from where
  you left off. The break reorganized something.

Step A12: Is the first-thought different from your A1 approach?
  YES → Go to SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION with this new frame.
  NO → Go to Step A13.

Step A13: Talk to someone who knows NOTHING about your domain.
  Explain the problem in plain language. Their job is only to
  ask questions, especially "why" and "what do you mean by..."
  Don't seek their solution. Seek the moment where explaining
  something reveals you don't understand it as well as you
  thought.
  What you should see: At least one point where you say "hm,
  good question" and don't have a ready answer.

Step A14: Did the conversation surface a gap in your
  understanding?
  YES → The gap IS the insight. Go to SECTION C.
  NO → Return to Step A3 with a DIFFERENT one-sentence
  description of your approach. You may have the wrong
  problem framing entirely. If you've cycled through A3
  three times with different framings, go to SECTION B
  (you may need to explore more broadly before this
  specific problem can yield).

================================================================
SECTION B: EXPLORATION
================================================================

You don't have a specific stuck-point. You want to discover
something interesting in a domain.

Step B1: Pick a domain boundary.
  Exploration requires a container. State what you're exploring.
  TOO BROAD: "science" / "business" / "philosophy"
  TOO NARROW: "the third parameter of this function"
  RIGHT SIZE: "how cells decide to divide" / "what makes
  some marketplaces succeed" / "the relationship between
  rhythm and meaning in poetry"
  What you should see: A scope where you could spend 2 hours
  and not run out of material, but not so broad you don't
  know where to start.

Step B2: Collect 5 SPECIFIC FACTS about your domain that you
  find surprising, confusing, or contradictory.
  Not "interesting" — specifically things that don't fit your
  current understanding.
  Read, search, ask, observe. Don't analyze yet. Just collect.
  ⚠️ WARNING: If everything you find makes sense, you're
  reading confirmatory material. Seek out critics, edge cases,
  failures, or historical wrong turns.

Step B3: For each fact, write: "This is surprising because I
  expected ___."
  The gap between expectation and reality is where discovery
  lives.
  What you should see: Your implicit model of the domain
  becoming visible.

Step B4: Do any two surprises seem related?
  Look for pairs where the same underlying cause could explain
  both.
  YES → Write a one-sentence hypothesis connecting them.
  Go to Step B6.
  NO → Go to Step B5.

Step B5: Pick the MOST surprising fact. Ask: "What ELSE would
  be true if this fact is pointing at something deeper?"
  List 3 predictions that would follow.
  Then check: are any of those predictions true?
  If YES → You may have found a pattern. State it as a
  hypothesis. Go to Step B6.
  If NO or UNCLEAR → Collect 5 more surprising facts
  (Step B2). After 3 cycles of B2-B5 with no emerging
  pattern, change your domain boundary (return to B1
  with an adjacent topic).

Step B6: You have a hypothesis. Now try to BREAK it.
  Find the strongest counterexample or objection.
  Not a straw-man — the real best argument against your idea.
  What you should see: Either the hypothesis breaks (return
  to B4 with a refined version) or survives with a
  clarification of its boundary conditions.

Step B7: The hypothesis survived attempted destruction.
  State it precisely: "In [context], [X] because [Y], which
  means [Z]."
  Go to SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION.

================================================================
SECTION C: CRYSTALLIZATION
================================================================

You have something — a new angle, a hypothesis, a felt sense
that something is there. The goal is to make it solid.

Step C1: State the insight in one sentence, as plainly as
  possible.
  No jargon. No hedging. Say what you actually think is true.
  "I think [X] is happening because [Y]."
  ⚠️ WARNING: If you can't state it in one sentence, you
  don't have one insight — you have several partial ones.
  List them separately and process each through C1.

Step C2: What did you believe BEFORE this insight?
  Write the old belief explicitly.
  What you should see: A clear contrast. If old and new
  aren't clearly different, the "insight" may be
  restatement, not reorganization. Return to wherever
  you came from.

Step C3: What CHANGES if this insight is correct?
  List concrete implications:
  - What would you do differently?
  - What would you predict differently?
  - What would you stop doing?
  - What new questions does it raise?
  Target: At least 3 concrete changes. If you can't find 3,
  the insight may be trivial — interesting but not
  action-relevant.

Step C4: What's the strongest argument AGAINST your insight?
  Write it as if you're a smart critic who disagrees.
  Not a weak objection — the real one.
  What you should see: Either a genuine threat to the insight
  (which refines it) or a clarification of the conditions
  under which it holds.

Step C5: Can you RE-DERIVE the insight from scratch?
  Close your notes. Wait 5 minutes. Then try to reconstruct
  the insight from memory, including the reasoning that led
  to it.
  YES, and the re-derivation matches → The insight is stable.
  Go to Step C6.
  YES, but the re-derivation is different → You have TWO
  paths to related but different insights. Both are worth
  keeping. State each separately and process the new one
  from C1.
  NO, can't reconstruct → The insight was state-dependent
  (mood, context). It may still be valid but needs more
  development. Return to the section you came from.

Step C6: Formalize and record.
  Write the insight in full:
  - The claim (one sentence)
  - The evidence (what led you here)
  - The boundary conditions (when this applies and doesn't)
  - The implications (what changes)
  - The open questions (what you still don't know)

  → PROCEDURE COMPLETE.
  You have a crystallized, tested, re-derivable insight.

================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
================================================================

CARD 1: THE INSIGHT LOOP
  Problem → Assumptions → Inversion → Discomfort → Follow
  the discomfort → New angle → Test → Crystallize

CARD 2: WHEN YOU'RE STUCK
  1. Name your approach in one sentence
  2. List its assumptions
  3. Invert the most uncomfortable one
  4. Explore the inversion without judging
  5. If nothing: change representation
  6. If nothing: take a physical break
  7. If nothing: explain to a non-expert

CARD 3: REPRESENTATION SWITCHES
  Words → Pictures → Stories → Math → Physical models
  Always switch TO whichever you haven't tried yet.

CARD 4: SURPRISE AS COMPASS
  Surprise = expectation ≠ reality
  The gap between what you expected and what you found
  is the most information-dense location in any domain.
  Go toward surprise, not away from it.

================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES
================================================================

1. TRYING HARDER IN THE SAME MODE
   Symptom: You've been at it for hours and feel like
   "if I just think a bit more..."
   Fix: Any approach that hasn't yielded in 30 minutes
   of focused effort needs a mode switch, not more effort.

2. SKIPPING THE DISCOMFORT
   Symptom: You invert an assumption and immediately think
   "that's obviously wrong" and move on.
   Fix: The inversion that feels most wrong is the most
   valuable to explore. "Obviously wrong" is your current
   model protecting itself.

3. PREMATURE FORMALIZATION
   Symptom: You have a vague sense of something and
   immediately try to write it precisely.
   Fix: Hold the vague sense. Sketch it. Talk about it
   loosely. Let it stabilize before locking it down.

4. CONFUSING NOVELTY WITH INSIGHT
   Symptom: "I've never thought of this before!" but it
   doesn't change anything you'd actually do.
   Fix: Apply the C3 test — does it change predictions
   or actions? If not, it's a curiosity, not an insight.

5. EXPLAINING AWAY ANOMALIES
   Symptom: "Oh that's just because of [easy explanation]"
   without checking.
   Fix: Write down the easy explanation. Then ask: "What
   if the easy explanation is wrong?" Investigate for
   at least 5 minutes before accepting it.

6. NEVER TESTING THE INSIGHT
   Symptom: You have an exciting idea and immediately
   start building on it without checking if it's true.
   Fix: Always do Step C4 (strongest counterargument)
   and C5 (re-derivation) before investing in the idea.

7. SOLO LOOP
   Symptom: You've been cycling alone for hours.
   Fix: Another person's questions are the cheapest way
   to surface assumptions you can't see. Talk to someone.

================================================================
WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE
================================================================

- SEEK EXPERT HELP when: The domain is technical and
  getting the answer wrong has high consequences (medical,
  legal, structural engineering, etc.). Use this procedure
  for understanding, not for final decisions in
  high-stakes technical domains.

- ABANDON THE PROCEDURE when: You've been through all
  three sections and nothing emerged. This likely means
  you need more raw material — go learn more about the
  domain before trying to have insights about it.

- SKIP TO SECTION C when: You already had the insight
  and just want to test and formalize it.

- USE A DIFFERENT APPROACH when: The "insight" you need
  is actually a calculation, a lookup, or a known result.
  Not everything requires discovery — sometimes you just
  need to find the answer someone else already has.

================================================================
WORKED EXAMPLES
================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Software engineer stuck on a performance bug

A1: "I'm trying to speed up the API by caching database
results."
A2: "Response time under 200ms for 95th percentile."
A3: Assumptions: speed is the problem (not perceived speed);
API is the bottleneck (not frontend); caching is the solution
(not restructuring); database is slow (not the query pattern);
results are cacheable (not dynamic).
A4: Inversion: "What if the database is fast and the problem
is the 47 sequential queries, not any single query's speed?"
A5: This feels uncomfortable because "we already looked at
the query count."
A6: [10 min exploring]: "If query count is the real issue,
then caching is a band-aid — we'd still make 47 round trips
to the cache. The real fix is restructuring the data access
pattern to batch..."
A7: YES — new angle: batch the data access, don't cache it.
C1: "The performance problem is 47 sequential round trips,
not slow individual queries."
C2: Previously believed individual query speed was the issue.
C3: Changes: stop optimizing individual queries, redesign
the data fetching to use 2-3 batch queries instead.
C4: Counter: "But some queries depend on previous results."
Response: "Only 3 of the 47 have true dependencies. The
other 44 can be parallelized or batched."
C5: Re-derived successfully. The key is round-trip count,
not query speed.
C6: Formalized. Insight is stable.

EXAMPLE 2: Researcher exploring "why some ideas spread"

B1: Domain boundary: "What determines whether an intellectual
idea gets adopted by a field vs. ignored."
B2: Surprising facts:
  1. Darwin's theory was independently co-discovered by
     Wallace — the time was "ripe."
  2. Mendel's genetics was ignored for 35 years then
     rediscovered by three people simultaneously.
  3. Continental drift was rejected for 50 years despite
     strong evidence.
  4. Some wrong ideas (phlogiston) persisted for decades
     with strong institutional support.
  5. Many breakthroughs came from outsiders to the field.
B3: "I expected ideas spread based on evidence quality.
But facts 2-4 show that evidence quality is nearly
irrelevant — timing and fit with existing frameworks
matter more."
B4: Facts 2 and 3 connect: both are about ideas that were
"right" but the field wasn't ready. Hypothesis: "An idea
spreads when it solves a problem the field is currently
stuck on, regardless of the idea's independent merit."
B6: Counter: "Antibiotics spread immediately based on
dramatic evidence." Refinement: "Ideas spread fast when
they solve a FELT problem. Fields with no felt problem
reject even correct ideas."
B7: Hypothesis survived: "Intellectual adoption is
demand-driven, not supply-driven. An idea needs a
pre-existing unsolved problem in the audience's mind
to land."
C1-C6: [crystallization process]...

EXAMPLE 3: Someone exploring personal career dissatisfaction

A1: "I'm trying to find a more fulfilling job by searching
for roles that match my skills."
A3: Assumptions: fulfillment comes from skill-match; jobs
are the unit of analysis (not projects or relationships);
searching is the right action (not creating); "my skills"
are fixed (not developable).
A4: "What if fulfillment has nothing to do with skill-match?"
A5: Deeply uncomfortable — "I spent years developing these
skills."
A6: [10 min]: "Every time I was most fulfilled, it wasn't
because I was using my skills — it was because I was
learning something new that felt slightly beyond me.
The fulfilled state is the learning state, not the
competence state..."
A7: YES — new angle.
C1: "I'm fulfilled by the learning edge, not by skill
application. I need a role that keeps me at the boundary
of my competence, not one that uses what I already know."

## Step 5: Anticipate Failures (`/fla`)

**Failure Mode 1: "I did the inversion and nothing happened"**
- Recognition: You completed A4-A6 mechanically but the inversions all felt academic, not visceral.
- Cause: The inversions were too surface-level. "What if fast is slow" isn't deep enough.
- Fix: Invert the GOAL, not just the method. "What if I don't actually want what I said I want in A2?"

**Failure Mode 2: Misidentifying your phase at Step 0**
- Recognition: You picked Section A but keep wanting to wander; you picked Section B but have a specific question nagging you.
- Cause: The felt-sense of "stuck" and "exploring" are different from the stated versions.
- Fix: If you're restless in your section, switch. The procedure works regardless of which section you enter through.

**Failure Mode 3: The crystallization test (C5) kills everything**
- Recognition: You keep failing to re-derive. Every insight evaporates when you try to reconstruct it.
- Cause: You may be having mood-dependent associations, not structural insights. Or your insights are real but pre-verbal.
- Fix: Instead of re-deriving in words, try re-deriving in a different medium (draw it, explain it aloud). If it still fails after 3 attempts in different media, the insight needs more incubation — return to it tomorrow.

**Failure Mode 4: Infinite loop in Section A**
- Recognition: You've gone through A3 three times with different framings and still nothing.
- Cause: You don't have enough raw material. You can't recombine what you don't have.
- Fix: The procedure says go to Section B. Actually do it. Spend a full day in exploration mode before returning to the stuck problem.

**Failure Mode 5: Section B produces "interesting" but not "useful"**
- Recognition: You have lots of surprising facts but they won't coalesce into a hypothesis.
- Cause: Possibly too broad a domain boundary, or the facts are from different sub-domains that don't actually connect.
- Fix: Narrow B1. Instead of "how cells decide to divide," try "what triggers the G1/S checkpoint specifically." Smaller scope = more likely to find real connections.

**Failure Mode 6: Social step (A13) is skipped**
- Recognition: "I don't have anyone to talk to" or "it would take too long to explain."
- Cause: This is often resistance, not logistics. The discomfort of admitting you're stuck.
- Fix: A rubber duck works partially. A non-expert works better. Even writing a letter explaining the problem to an imaginary reader captures 60% of the benefit. Don't skip this step.

**Failure Mode 7: Mistaking restatement for insight**
- Recognition: C2 check reveals old belief and new belief are the same thing said differently.
- Cause: The "insight" is a reframe without substance. "We need to be more agile" vs "we need to move faster" — same belief, different words.
- Fix: Apply the C3 test ruthlessly. If the "insight" doesn't change a single concrete action or prediction, it's restatement.

---

## Step 6: Validate Executability (`/pv`)

Checking every step against the standard: Can someone with no expertise execute this?

**Issues found and fixed:**

1. **Step A3 "list every assumption"** — Could be vague for novices. FIXED: Added the word-by-word method with a concrete example showing how to extract assumptions from each word.

2. **Step A6 "explore for 10 minutes"** — "Explore" could be ambiguous. FIXED: Specified "write continuously, don't stop to judge."

3. **Step B2 "collect 5 surprising facts"** — "Surprising" is subjective. FIXED: Added the explicit frame "things that don't fit your current understanding" and the warning about confirmatory material.

4. **Step B6 "try to break it"** — Could be unclear how. FIXED: Specified "find the strongest counterexample or objection" with the anti-strawman instruction.

5. **Step C5 "re-derive from scratch"** — "From scratch" is ambiguous (can I use notes?). FIXED: Specified "close your notes, wait 5 minutes."

6. **All decision points verified**: Every YES/NO branch has explicit routing. No dead ends. No "use judgment" gaps.

7. **Every path terminates**: Section A eventually routes to B or C. Section B eventually routes to C or restarts with narrower scope. Section C terminates at C6 or loops back with specific instructions.

8. **Jargon check**: "Incubation," "representation," "functional fixedness" — all replaced with plain-language equivalents in the procedure itself. Technical terms appear only in this analysis, not in the steps.

**Validation status**: All steps are executable without domain expertise. All paths terminate. All decision points are explicit.
