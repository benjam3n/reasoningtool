  GOAL: Create /sp — a skill that takes a raw prompt and makes it as strong as possible                                                                                                 
  before it gets answered. Not answering the prompt — improving the prompt itself.

    [H2] MUST: Works on propositional prompts (claims, decisions, diagnostics)                                                                                                          
    [H3] MUST: Follows existing skill patterns (YAML frontmatter, numbered findings, phases)                                                                                            
    [H4] MUST: The improved prompt is usable — you can paste it into a new session and run it                                                                                           
    [H5] SHOULD: Makes hidden assumptions explicit                                                                                                                                      
    [H6] SHOULD: Identifies what TYPE of prompt it is and applies type-appropriate improvement                                                                                          
    [H7] SHOULD: Adds success criteria the original prompt lacked                                                                                                                       
    [H8] SHOULD: Preserves the user's original intent (doesn't drift)

    [H10] Should be usable in a chain: /sp [prompt] → take output → /araw [improved prompt]                                                                                             
    [H11] From the AW analysis: only some prompt types benefit — needs to handle this gracefully                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  NOT THE GOAL: Answering the prompt. Generating content. Evaluating the prompt's topic.

  Direct methods:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H12] METHOD: Unbundle-then-reconstruct — Use /u's unbundling technique (explicit, implicit, presupposed, bundled, meta) on the prompt itself, then reconstruct with all claims made  
  explicit.                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H13] METHOD: Criteria injection — Analyze what a good answer would need to satisfy, write success criteria, append them to the prompt as constraints.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H14] METHOD: AR the prompt — Run /ar on "this prompt will produce a good output" to find what must be true for the prompt to work, then add those conditions to the prompt.          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H15] METHOD: AW the prompt — Run /aw on "this prompt will produce a good output" to find failure modes, then modify the prompt to prevent each failure mode.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H16] METHOD: Type-classify-then-template — Classify prompt type (propositional, creative, diagnostic, exploratory, request), apply a type-specific steelmanning template for each.   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Instance-to-category:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H17] This goal is an instance of: PROGRAM OPTIMIZATION — taking code (a prompt) and making it run better (produce better output) without changing its semantics (intent).            
  [H18] Category method: Compiler optimization passes — multiple independent passes, each improving one dimension. Apply multiple independent improvement passes to the prompt.         
  [H19] Category method: Code review — a checklist of things to check, flag, and fix.

  Inversion — what makes prompts BAD?                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [H20] BLOCKER: Ambiguity — the prompt could be interpreted multiple ways                                                                                                              
  [H21] REMOVAL METHOD: Disambiguation pass — identify each ambiguous term/phrase, resolve it                                                                                           
  [H22] BLOCKER: Missing context — the prompt assumes knowledge the model doesn't have                                                                                                  
  [H23] REMOVAL METHOD: Context injection — identify what context is needed, add it                                                                                                     
  [H24] BLOCKER: Scope creep — the prompt asks for too much, so output is shallow on everything                                                                                         
  [H25] REMOVAL METHOD: Scope bounding — identify what's in/out of scope, state it                                                                                                      
  [H26] BLOCKER: Wrong framing — the prompt asks the wrong question                                                                                                                     
  [H27] REMOVAL METHOD: Reframing pass — check if the prompt question is the real question

  arbitrary prompts.                                                                                                                                                                    
  [H30] EXEMPLAR: Socratic questioning — asking clarifying questions about the prompt before answering. METHOD: Generate questions about the prompt, answer them, fold answers into the 
  prompt.

  [H31] REFRAME: Instead of improving the prompt text, identify what SKILL should be applied and route to it. /sp becomes a router that says "your question is really a /araw question" 
  or "this is a /wt question."

  [H37] METHOD H12 (unbundle-reconstruct) requires: The prompt must contain claims to unbundle — MET: yes for propositional, no for pure requests ("get me coffee")                     
  [H38] METHOD H13 (criteria injection) requires: Ability to determine what "good" means for this prompt's output — MET: yes (model can infer)                                          
  [H39] METHOD H16 (type-classify-template) requires: A useful taxonomy of prompt types — MET: unknown, needs design                                                                    
  [H40] METHOD H18 (multi-pass optimization) requires: Passes that are independently useful and composable — MET: yes if passes are well-defined                                        
  [H41] METHOD H28 (DSPy-style) requires: A metric to optimize against — MET: no (no automated metric for prompt quality in this context)                                               
  [H42] METHOD H29 (extract skill pattern) requires: Understanding what makes skills good — MET: yes (the skills exist as examples)                                                     
  [H43] METHOD H30 (Socratic questioning) requires: Interactive back-and-forth — MET: no in single invocation, but could generate and self-answer

  [H45] If right: Every prompt has hidden claims. Unbundling finds them. Making them explicit gives the model more to work with. — Necessary                                            
  [H46] If right: The reconstructed prompt is longer but more precise — each ambiguity resolved — Probable

  [H48] Wrong because: Some prompts are already clear — unbundling adds nothing but tokens — Conditional                                                                                
  [H49] Wrong because: Unbundling might CHANGE the intent by making explicit something the user wanted left implicit — Serious

  [H57] If right: Different prompt types need different improvements. A decision prompt needs options surfaced. A diagnostic prompt needs symptom isolation. A claim prompt needs       
  assumption extraction. — Necessary

  [H84] METHOD H18 (multi-pass) breaks when: The prompt is already well-structured (e.g., someone passes a SKILL.md through /sp) — adds overhead for no gain                            
  [H85] METHOD H16 (type-classify) breaks when: Prompt is genuinely novel — doesn't fit any type                                                                                        
  [H86] METHOD H13 (criteria) breaks at scale: 20 criteria on a simple prompt is absurd — need proportionality                                                                          
  [H87] METHOD H12 (unbundle) has hidden cost: Unbundled prompts are harder to read — the user needs the improved version to be usable, not an analytical decomposition                 
  [H88] ALL METHODS break when: The prompt is non-propositional ("write me a poem") — the AW analysis (F36) established this. Need graceful handling.                                   
  [H89] ALL METHODS have hidden cost: /sp adds a step before every prompt. If used routinely, this doubles prompting time. Should be optional, not default.
