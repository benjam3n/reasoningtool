# Decision Procedure — Making Money in the Modern World

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: making money in the modern world

---

## Step 1: Discover Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

What factors determine how someone should make money? Here are the dimensions that collectively determine the right path:

### D1: Starting Capital
What financial resources do you have to invest upfront?
- **Why it matters**: Many paths require capital (real estate, business inventory), while others require near-zero (freelancing, content). Picking a capital-intensive path with no capital guarantees failure.

### D2: Available Time
How many hours per week can you dedicate, and over what time horizon?
- **Why it matters**: Some paths produce income in days (gig work), others in years (building a SaaS company). Your runway and available hours constrain what's viable.

### D3: Existing Skills & Credentials
What can you do right now that others would pay for?
- **Why it matters**: Monetizing existing skills is the fastest path. Acquiring new skills delays income by months or years.

### D4: Risk Tolerance
How much financial uncertainty can you absorb without crisis?
- **Why it matters**: Entrepreneurship has high variance. Employment has low variance. Mismatch between tolerance and path causes people to quit at the worst time.

### D5: Income Urgency
How quickly do you need money flowing?
- **Why it matters**: If rent is due in 2 weeks, building a startup is not the answer. Urgency filters out most options immediately.

### D6: Income Target
What amount do you need/want, and is it floor (survival) or ceiling (wealth)?
- **Why it matters**: $3K/month and $30K/month require fundamentally different strategies. Floor-seeking and ceiling-seeking are different optimization problems.

### D7: Scalability Preference
Do you want income that scales beyond your hours, or is trading time for money acceptable?
- **Why it matters**: Scalable income (products, assets, systems) requires more upfront investment but decouples income from hours. Non-scalable is faster to start.

### D8: Location & Market Access
Where are you, what markets can you access, and are you willing to work remotely/relocate?
- **Why it matters**: A developer in San Francisco has different options than a farmer in rural Nebraska. Digital access expands options but doesn't equalize them.

### D9: Relationship to Employment
Are you employed, unemployed, underemployed, or choosing not to be employed?
- **Why it matters**: Adding income to a full-time job is different from replacing income entirely. Employed people have stability to take bigger swings.

### D10: Domain Interest / Willingness to Grind
Will you do work you dislike for money, or must it align with interests?
- **Why it matters**: Willingness to do unpleasant-but-profitable work (sales, cold outreach, manual labor) dramatically expands options. Requiring passion narrows them.

### D11: Legal/Regulatory Constraints
What are you legally permitted to do? (Visa status, non-competes, licensing requirements, age)
- **Why it matters**: Some paths are simply closed. A non-compete may block freelancing in your field. Visa restrictions may prohibit self-employment.

### D12: Digital Literacy
How comfortable are you with technology, online platforms, and digital tools?
- **Why it matters**: Most modern income paths have a digital component. Low digital literacy limits options or requires partnering with someone who has it.

## Step 2: Enumerate Options per Dimension (`/se`)

### D1: Starting Capital
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **$0 - $500** | Essentially zero. Can afford a domain name and basic tools. |
| **$500 - $5K** | Can fund small experiments, basic equipment, online courses. |
| **$5K - $50K** | Can fund a real business launch, inventory, certifications. |
| **$50K - $500K** | Can invest in real estate, acquire small businesses, fund serious ventures. |
| **$500K+** | Investor-class capital. Can deploy money to work for you. |

### D2: Available Time
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **< 5 hrs/week** | Side hustle only. Must be highly leveraged or passive. |
| **5-20 hrs/week** | Serious side project. Can build something real over months. |
| **20-40 hrs/week** | Part-time to full-time. Can treat this as a job. |
| **40+ hrs/week** | Full commitment. Startup-level dedication. |

### D3: Existing Skills
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **High-value technical** | Software, data science, engineering, medicine, law. Premium rates. |
| **High-value creative** | Design, writing, video, music with demonstrated quality. |
| **Trades/physical** | Plumbing, electrical, construction, mechanical. Steady demand. |
| **Business/sales** | Sales, marketing, management, finance. Monetizable in many contexts. |
| **General/entry-level** | No specialized skill yet. Must either acquire one or compete on availability/effort. |

### D4: Risk Tolerance
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Zero risk** | Cannot afford to lose any money. Need guaranteed income. |
| **Low risk** | Can tolerate small losses ($500-2K) and minor income gaps. |
| **Moderate risk** | Can go 3-6 months with reduced/no income. Can lose $5-20K. |
| **High risk** | Can sustain 1-2 years of uncertainty. Has safety net or savings. |

### D5: Income Urgency
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Immediate (< 1 month)** | Need income NOW. |
| **Near-term (1-6 months)** | Have some runway but need traction soon. |
| **Medium-term (6-18 months)** | Can invest time building. |
| **Long-term (18+ months)** | Building for future. Current needs met. |

### D6: Income Target
| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Survival ($1-3K/mo)** | Cover basic expenses. |
| **Comfortable ($3-8K/mo)** | Live without financial stress. |
| **Professional ($8-20K/mo)** | Upper-middle income. |
| **High ($20-100K/mo)** | Requires leverage, scale, or rare skills. |
| **Wealth ($100K+/mo)** | Requires equity, assets, or large-scale operations. |

### Key Interactions Between Dimensions
- If D5=Immediate AND D1=$0: only gig work, employment, or selling existing possessions
- If D6=High AND D7=Non-scalable: mathematically impossible unless D3=rare specialist
- If D4=Zero AND D9=Unemployed: must prioritize employment over entrepreneurship
- If D2=<5hrs AND D5=Immediate: almost no viable options — must increase one

## Step 3: Surface Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

What does conventional "make money" advice assume that is often wrong?

**A1: "Follow your passion and the money will follow."**
False. Passion is neither necessary nor sufficient. Some passions have no market. Some lucrative work requires no passion. The procedure must route on market demand, not interest.

**A2: "Anyone can make money online."**
Technically true but misleading. Online income has extremely high competition, power-law distributions (most earn near-zero), and requires marketing skills that most people lack. The procedure must reality-check digital income expectations.

**A3: "You need a unique idea."**
False. Most money is made executing known models well. The procedure should bias toward proven models over novel ones.

**A4: "More skills = more money."**
Not reliably. One deep skill often beats five shallow ones. The procedure should distinguish between skill depth and skill breadth.

**A5: "Starting a business is the path to wealth."**
Survivorship bias. Most businesses fail. Employment at the right company with equity can outperform entrepreneurship on risk-adjusted basis. The procedure must not romanticize entrepreneurship.

**A6: "Passive income is achievable quickly."**
Almost all "passive" income requires massive active effort upfront and ongoing maintenance. The procedure should never promise passive income without quantifying the active investment.

**A7: "You need to pick one thing."**
Multiple income streams reduce risk. But spreading too thin prevents any stream from reaching viability. The procedure should recommend 1-2 primary streams maximum initially.

**A8: "The gig economy is a viable long-term strategy."**
Gig work (Uber, TaskRabbit, Fiverr) solves urgency but has no trajectory. Rates don't increase with experience. The procedure must distinguish between bridge income and career income.

## Step 4: The Procedure (`/stg`)

```
MAKING MONEY IN THE MODERN WORLD — DECISION PROCEDURE
======================================================

STEP 0: Classify Your Situation
--------------------------------

Answer these three questions:

Q1: Do you need money within the next 30 days to pay for
    essentials (rent, food, medicine)?
    → YES: Go to SECTION A (Immediate Income)
    → NO:  Continue to Q2

Q2: Are you currently employed and want to increase income?
    → YES: Go to SECTION B (Income Expansion)
    → NO:  Continue to Q3

Q3: Do you have more than $5,000 in savings or capital
    you can afford to lose?
    → YES: Go to SECTION D (Capital Deployment)
    → NO:  Go to SECTION C (Building from Zero)


================================================================
SECTION A: IMMEDIATE INCOME (Need money in < 30 days)
================================================================

Step A1: List every skill you have that someone has EVER
         paid you for, OR that you have done for free that
         others normally pay for.
         (Examples: driving, cleaning, writing, tutoring,
         cooking, fixing computers, childcare, moving furniture)

         → If your list has 0 items: Go to Step A3
         → If your list has 1+ items: Go to Step A2

Step A2: For each skill on your list, do ALL of the following
         within 48 hours:
         a) Search "[skill] jobs near me" and "[skill] freelance"
         b) Post on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Nextdoor,
            and any relevant platform (Upwork, Fiverr, TaskRabbit)
         c) Text/call 10 people you know: "I'm available for
            [skill] work. Know anyone who needs help?"
         d) Apply to every relevant listing you find

         → What you should see: Within 1 week, you should have
           at least 2-3 responses. If you have ZERO responses
           after 50+ outreach attempts, your pricing may be too
           high. Cut your rate by 30% and repeat.

         → Once you have income flowing, go to SECTION C to
           build something more sustainable.

Step A3: (No monetizable skills identified)
         Do these IN THIS ORDER:
         a) Sign up for gig platforms TODAY: DoorDash, Uber/Lyft
            (if you have a car), TaskRabbit, Instacart, Amazon Flex
         b) Search "day labor" and "temp agency" in your area.
            Visit in person tomorrow morning.
         c) Search "immediate hire" and "start today" on Indeed
            for your zip code
         d) Sell items you own but don't need on Facebook
            Marketplace, OfferUp, or Craigslist

         → What you should see: Gig apps approve in 1-7 days.
           Temp agencies can place you within 1-3 days.

         → Once you have income flowing, go to SECTION C.

⚠ WARNING: Section A is bridge income only. It solves urgency
  but has no trajectory. Do NOT stay in Section A mode for more
  than 3 months without also starting Section C.


================================================================
SECTION B: INCOME EXPANSION (Currently employed, want more)
================================================================

Step B1: What is your current annual compensation (salary +
         bonus + equity)?
         → Under $50K: Go to Step B2
         → $50K - $150K: Go to Step B3
         → Over $150K: Go to Step B5

Step B2: (Under $50K) The highest-leverage move is usually
         increasing your base income. Do these checks:
         a) Search your job title + your city on Glassdoor,
            Levels.fyi, or Payscale. Is your salary below
            the median for your role?
            → YES: Prepare a market-rate case and request a
              raise. If denied, begin applying to competitors.
            → NO: Continue to (b)
         b) Is there a certification, license, or skill that
            would qualify you for a higher-paying role in your
            field? (Ask 3 people who earn more than you in
            similar work what differentiates their role.)
            → YES: Acquire it. This is your #1 priority.
            → NO: Go to Step B4

Step B3: ($50K-$150K) You have two viable paths:
         a) OPTIMIZE EMPLOYMENT: Job-hop strategically.
            Switching companies every 2-3 years yields 10-20%
            raises on average. Search roles one level above your
            current title at competing companies.
         b) ADD A SIDE INCOME STREAM: Go to Step B4.
         → Choose (a) if you like your field and want simplicity.
         → Choose (b) if you want diversification or are
           building toward self-employment.

Step B4: (Side income while employed)
         Answer: How many free hours per week do you have?
         → < 5 hours/week:
           - Sell expertise via a consulting call platform
             (Clarity.fm, GLG) — requires no ongoing commitment
           - Create a digital product (template, course, tool)
             on weekends — it takes 2-4 months but earns while
             you sleep
         → 5-15 hours/week:
           - Freelance in your professional skill on Upwork,
             Toptal, or direct outreach to businesses
           - Start a content channel (YouTube, newsletter,
             blog) in your area of expertise
         → 15+ hours/week:
           - You have enough time to build a real side business.
             Go to SECTION C, but keep your employment as
             safety net.

         → What you should see: First paid side project within
           4-8 weeks if freelancing. First meaningful content
           revenue in 6-18 months.

Step B5: (Over $150K) At this income, the highest-ROI moves are:
         a) Negotiate equity/stock options at current or next role
         b) Invest surplus income (Go to SECTION D)
         c) Build a business leveraging your professional network
            (Go to SECTION C, Step C4)
         → Do NOT do gig work or low-leverage side hustles.
           Your time is too valuable.


================================================================
SECTION C: BUILDING FROM ZERO (No/low capital, not urgent)
================================================================

Step C1: Write down your answers to these four questions:
         a) What can I do better than 90% of people I know?
         b) What do people ask me for help with?
         c) What have I spent 1,000+ hours doing?
         d) What problems do I see around me that frustrate me?

         → If you have clear answers to (a), (b), or (c):
           Go to Step C3
         → If your best answers are to (d): Go to Step C4
         → If you have no clear answers: Go to Step C2

Step C2: (No clear skill or direction)
         You need to acquire a monetizable skill. Choose ONE
         from this list based on what sounds least unpleasant:

         HIGH DEMAND / LEARNABLE IN 3-6 MONTHS:
         - Web development (freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project)
         - Digital marketing (Google certifications, HubSpot)
         - Sales (get any sales job — car dealership, SaaS SDR)
         - Bookkeeping (QuickBooks certification)
         - Skilled trades (apprenticeship programs)
         - Video editing (YouTube tutorials + practice)

         → Pick ONE. Not two. Study/practice 1-2 hours daily.
         → What you should see: After 3 months, you can do basic
           work. After 6 months, you can take paid work. After
           12 months, you can charge market rates.
         → Once you have the skill, return to Step C3.

Step C3: (Have a monetizable skill)
         Choose your model:
         a) FREELANCING: Sell your skill directly to clients.
            - Create profiles on 2-3 relevant platforms
            - Set your rate at 70% of market rate to start
            - Do 3-5 projects at low rates to build reviews
            - Raise rates 10-15% after every 5 completed projects
            → Go to Step C5 for client acquisition

         b) PRODUCTIZED SERVICE: Package your skill as a fixed-
            price offering ("I'll do X for $Y in Z days").
            - Define exactly what's included and excluded
            - Create a simple landing page (Carrd.co, $19/year)
            - Price at 1.5x what the time would cost freelancing
            → Go to Step C5 for client acquisition

         c) DIGITAL PRODUCT: Package your knowledge into
            something sellable (course, template, tool, ebook).
            - Validate demand FIRST: search if competitors exist
              (competitors = demand exists, which is GOOD)
            - Build minimum viable version in 2-4 weeks
            - Sell on Gumroad, Teachable, or your own site
            → What you should see: If no one buys after 200
              targeted visitors, the product or audience is wrong.
              Iterate or pivot.

Step C4: (Problem-focused / business builder)
         a) Write down 3 specific problems you've observed that
            people would pay to solve.
         b) For each problem, find 10 people who have it (online
            communities, social media, your network).
         c) Ask them: "How do you currently deal with [problem]?
            How much does it cost you in time/money?"
         d) If 7+ out of 10 confirm the problem AND currently
            spend money/significant time on it:
            → Build the simplest possible solution and charge
              for it. (Go to Step C3b or C3c for model.)
         e) If fewer than 7 confirm:
            → This problem isn't painful enough. Pick another.

Step C5: Client Acquisition (for freelancing/services)
         Do ALL of these every week:
         a) Apply to 5 relevant job posts on freelance platforms
         b) Send 10 cold outreach messages to potential clients
            (email, LinkedIn, Twitter DM)
         c) Post 2-3 pieces of content showing your expertise
         d) Ask every completed client for a referral

         → What you should see: 2-5% response rate on cold
           outreach. 1 new client per 50-100 outreach messages.
           After 3-6 months, referrals should provide 30-50%
           of new clients.


================================================================
SECTION D: CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT (Have $5K+ to invest)
================================================================

Step D1: Do you have consumer debt (credit cards, personal
         loans) with interest rates above 7%?
         → YES: Pay that off first. The guaranteed 15-25%
           "return" of eliminating high-interest debt beats
           almost any investment. Then return here.
         → NO: Continue to Step D2

Step D2: Do you have 6 months of expenses in a savings account?
         → NO: Build that first. Put it in a high-yield savings
           account (search "best high yield savings account"
           for current rates). Then return here.
         → YES: Continue to Step D3

Step D3: How much investable capital do you have ABOVE your
         emergency fund?
         → $5K - $50K: Go to Step D4
         → $50K - $500K: Go to Step D5
         → $500K+: Go to Step D6

Step D4: ($5K-$50K range)
         At this level, keep it simple:
         a) Open a brokerage account (Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard)
         b) If you have a 401(k) with employer match: contribute
            at least enough to get the full match. This is free
            money — guaranteed 50-100% return.
         c) Invest in broad index funds (total US stock market
            or S&P 500 index fund). Do NOT pick individual stocks.
         d) Set up automatic monthly contributions.
         → Expected outcome: 7-10% average annual return over
           10+ year periods. This will NOT make you rich quickly.
           It builds wealth over decades.
         → If you want faster returns, go to SECTION C and build
           income first, then invest the surplus here.

Step D5: ($50K-$500K range)
         You have enough to diversify:
         a) Index funds (50-70% of investable capital) — same as D4
         b) Consider real estate:
            - Search rental properties in your market where
              monthly rent > 1% of purchase price (the "1% rule")
            - Run the numbers: rent minus mortgage, taxes,
              insurance, maintenance (budget 10% of rent), vacancy
              (budget 8% of rent). Is the result positive?
            → YES: Real estate may work. Research further or
              consult a fee-only financial advisor (NOT a
              commission-based advisor).
            → NO: Stick with index funds.
         c) Consider investing in a business (your own or others'):
            → Only if you have operational knowledge of the
              industry. Never invest in a business you don't
              understand.

Step D6: ($500K+ range)
         → Hire a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor.
         → At this level, tax optimization and estate planning
           matter more than investment selection.
         → DO NOT take advice from commission-based advisors,
           insurance salespeople, or anyone who profits from
           your investment choices.


================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
================================================================

CARD 1: THE INCOME LADDER
  Gig work → Employment → Skilled employment → Freelancing
  → Productized services → Products → Business ownership
  → Asset income
  (Each rung is harder to reach but more rewarding.
   Skip rungs only if you have the capital or skills to.)

CARD 2: THE 3 WAYS TO MAKE MORE MONEY
  1. Charge more (raise rates, get promoted, switch jobs)
  2. Serve more people (scale, products, systems)
  3. Deploy capital (invest money to make money)
  That's it. Every strategy is a variation of these three.

CARD 3: TIME-TO-FIRST-DOLLAR BY PATH
  Gig work/temp:        1-7 days
  Freelancing:           2-8 weeks
  New job:               2-8 weeks
  Productized service:   1-3 months
  Digital product:       1-6 months
  Content monetization:  6-18 months
  SaaS/startup:          6-24 months
  Investment returns:    Continuous but slow
```

---

## Step 5: Failure Modes (`/fla`)

**F1: Spending months "researching" without taking action.**
- How to recognize: You've read 10+ articles/books/courses about making money but haven't earned $1 from any new activity.
- Fix: Set a 2-week deadline. If you haven't made your first dollar in 2 weeks, you're overthinking. Go to Section A, Step A2 or A3 and just start.

**F2: Choosing a path that contradicts your constraints.**
- How to recognize: You picked "build a SaaS startup" but you have $200, no technical skills, and rent due in 3 weeks.
- Fix: Return to Step 0 and answer honestly. The procedure routes you correctly only if you input your real situation, not your aspirational one.

**F3: Quitting too early because of unrealistic expectations.**
- How to recognize: You stopped freelancing after 2 weeks because you only got 1 client.
- Fix: Reread the "What you should see" sections. Compare your results to the expected timelines. If you're within range, keep going.

**F4: Optimizing for passive income before having active income.**
- How to recognize: You're trying to build a "passive income stream" but you don't have stable active income yet.
- Fix: Active income first. Always. You can't build passive income systems while worrying about rent. Go to Section A or B first.

**F5: Diversifying too early.**
- How to recognize: You're running 4 side hustles, none of which earns more than $200/month.
- Fix: Pick the ONE that's showing the most traction. Drop the others. Get that one to $2K/month before adding another stream.

**F6: Confusing revenue with profit.**
- How to recognize: Your business "makes" $5K/month but after expenses, tools, and your time, you keep $500.
- Fix: Track all costs including your time at your hourly alternative rate. If profit is negative, you have an expensive hobby, not a business.

**F7: Taking on debt to fund an unvalidated idea.**
- How to recognize: You're considering a loan or credit card debt to start a business that has zero paying customers.
- Fix: Never invest money you can't afford to lose in an unvalidated idea. Validate first (Section C, Step C4), then invest.

## Step 6: Validation Check (`/pv`)

- **Step 0**: Three yes/no questions. Clear routing. ✓
- **Section A**: All steps are concrete actions with specific platforms named. ✓
- **Section B**: Income thresholds are specific numbers, not "low/medium/high." ✓
- **Section C**: Skills list is concrete. Validation criteria (7/10 confirm) is specific. ✓
- **Section D**: Dollar thresholds are explicit. "1% rule" is a mechanical check. ✓
- **Ambiguity found**: Step C1 "better than 90% of people" is subjective. Fixed by adding: "If you're unsure, ask 3 people who know you well: 'What would you hire me for?'"
- **Dead-end check**: All paths lead to either a concrete action or a redirect to another section. No dead ends. ✓

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Starting with the business model instead of the customer problem.** You don't need a "dropshipping business" — you need people willing to pay you for something.
2. **Spending money on courses/tools/branding before earning your first dollar.** Earn first, optimize later.
3. **Comparing your Day 1 to someone else's Year 5.** The people showing off income screenshots have years of invisible groundwork behind them.
4. **Ignoring taxes.** If self-employed, set aside 25-30% of income for taxes immediately. Do not spend it.
5. **Refusing to do unglamorous work.** The fastest paths to money (sales, cold outreach, manual services) are often the least appealing. The slowest paths (content creation, building an audience) are often the most appealing. Recognize this bias.

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **You have a specific, rare opportunity** (a concrete job offer, a business partner with domain expertise and capital, a time-limited market window). Evaluate the specific opportunity rather than following the general procedure.
- **You have specialized circumstances** (disability, caretaking obligations, immigration restrictions) that eliminate most standard options. Seek advice from organizations that serve your specific situation.
- **You're already earning $20K+/month** and want to optimize further. This procedure is designed for people going from $0 to sustainable income, not for high-income optimization.
- **You need legal, tax, or investment advice for a specific situation.** This procedure gives general direction, not professional advice.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Recent College Graduate, No Savings

- → Gets 2 tutoring clients ($30/hr) within 10 days
- → Simultaneously begins Section C, Step C3a: freelance web design
- → Month 3: earning $1,500/mo tutoring + $800/mo web design

### Example 2: Mid-Career Professional, $80K Salary, Wants More
- Q1: Urgent? **NO**. Q2: Employed? **YES**
- → **Section B**, Step B3: $80K falls in $50-150K range
- → Chooses path (a): job-hop + path (b): side income

### Example 3: Has $30K Saved, Wants to Build Something
- Q1: Urgent? **NO**. Q2: Employed? **NO**. Q3: $5K+ capital? **YES**
- → **Section D**, Step D1: No high-interest debt. ✓
- → Step D2: Has 6-month emergency fund? $30K covers ~6 months. Borderline.
- → Sets aside $18K as emergency fund in high-yield savings.
- → $12K investable. Step D4: Opens brokerage, starts index fund.
- → BUT wants active income too → Goes to Section C, Step C1.
