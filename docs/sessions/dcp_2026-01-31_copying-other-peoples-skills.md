# COPYING OTHER PEOPLE'S SKILLS, ACTIONS, GUESSES & THINKING — DECISION PROCEDURE

## PURPOSE

You have identified someone who is good at something you want to be good at. This procedure tells you exactly how to figure out what they are actually doing and install it in yourself.

---

## STEP 0: CLASSIFY WHAT YOU WANT TO COPY

**0.1** Write down: "[Name] can [specific observable action] and I currently cannot, or I can but much worse."

**0.2** Categorize:

| If the skill mostly involves... | Category | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Moving the body (sports, surgery, music, cooking) | PHYSICAL SKILL | A |
| Making judgments or decisions (pricing, hiring, diagnosing) | COGNITIVE SKILL — JUDGMENT | B |
| Interacting with people (persuading, teaching, leading, selling) | SOCIAL SKILL | C |
| Producing original work (writing, designing, composing) | CREATIVE SKILL | D |
| Reacting correctly under time pressure (trading, emergency response) | REACTIVE SKILL | E |
| Knowing what to do without explaining why (intuition, "gut feel") | TACIT KNOWLEDGE | F |
| Following a process or method (debugging, analyzing, managing) | PROCEDURAL SKILL | G |

If it spans categories, pick the one describing the HARDEST part.

**0.3** Gate: Have you seen this person perform the skill at least twice? If NO — go observe twice first.

---

## STEP 1: CHOOSE WHO TO COPY (MODEL SELECTION)

**1.1** List 2-5 candidates.

**1.2** Score each (1-5):

| Criterion | 5 = ideal | 1 = worst |
|---|---|---|
| ACCESSIBILITY | Work alongside them daily | Can only see public output |
| RECENCY | Did it yesterday | Retired years ago |
| SIMILARITY | Very similar background/situation | Wildly different |
| ARTICULACY | Teaches it professionally | "I don't know, I just do it" |
| VERIFIED RESULTS | Measurable track record | Reputation only |

**1.3** Below 12 = WARNING. Below 8 = find different model or supplement.

**1.4** Highest score = primary model. Second = secondary (for comparison).

---

## STEP 2: DETERMINE WHAT TO COPY (DECOMPOSITION)

Most copying fails here. People try to copy the whole person instead of isolating components.

**2.1 List visible outputs** — every observable thing they produce. At least 8.

**2.2 List input-response pairs** — "When X happens, they do Y." At least 5.

**2.3 List what they DON'T do** — what amateurs do that they avoid. At least 3.

**2.4 Identify the sequence** — First → Then → If [condition] → Finally.

**2.5 Mark mystery steps** — where you wrote "somehow" or "just knows." These are where the real skill lives.

---

## STEP 3: INVESTIGATE THE MYSTERY STEPS (EXTRACTION)

### Method A: Structured Observation
Watch in real time (don't ask them to explain while doing). Record:
- Where their EYES go (information sources)
- What their HANDS do (procedure)
- How LONG each step takes (fast=automatic, slow=deliberate)
- What they do immediately BEFORE the mystery step
- Watch 3+ times. What stays the same = the skill.

### Method B: Retrospective Interview
Ask IN THIS ORDER:
1. "Walk me through the last time you did [skill]."
2. "At [mystery step], what were you paying attention to?"
3. "Has that step ever gone wrong? What happened?"
4. "If training someone who kept getting that wrong, what would you tell them to look for?"
5. "Does anyone do this differently but still get good results?"
6. "What's the most common mistake you see?"
7. "When you first learned this, what was hardest?"
8. "What would you do differently if [constraint changed]?"
9. "Is there anything you do that's unusual?"
10. "What do you wish someone told you when you started?"

**WARNING:** People routinely misreport what they actually do. If description contradicts observation, trust observation.

### Method C: Reverse Engineering Outputs
Collect 10-20 examples of finished work. Sort by quality/type. Work backwards: "What decision produced this?" Look for patterns. Then produce your own version WITHOUT looking at theirs — differences are where you need to develop.

---

## STEP 4: EXECUTE THE COPY (BY SKILL TYPE)

### SECTION A: PHYSICAL SKILLS
1. **Film comparison** — side-by-side video. List every difference.
2. **Isolate critical motion** — the 1-3 moments that determine success. Practice ONLY that 50 times first.
3. **Slow to 50%** — match form exactly. Speed comes from repetition.
4. **Same-day feedback** — compare video after each session. Fix ONE thing per session.
5. **Increase speed incrementally** — if form breaks, go back one level.
6. **Test in real conditions** — if it falls apart, isolate that part.
- **Verification:** Match form at full speed, results within 80%.

### SECTION B: COGNITIVE SKILLS / JUDGMENT
1. **Decision inventory** — every decision point: inputs, options, what they pick, boundary conditions.
2. **IF-THEN rules** — convert to explicit rules. At least 5.
3. **Shadow-judge** — before they decide, write YOUR prediction. Compare. 10+ rounds before changing behavior.
4. **Identify weighting** — when factors conflict, which wins? Write priority order.
5. **Test yourself** — predict their calls on 10 past cases. 8/10+=proceed, 5-7=more shadow-judging, <5=re-extract.
6. **Install** — consult written rules for next 20 real calls.
7. **Graduate** — try 5 without rules. Match 4/5 = internalizing.
- **Verification:** 80%+ prediction accuracy AND measurably improved results.

### SECTION C: SOCIAL SKILLS
1. **Map triggers** — "Other person does X → Model does Y → Result Z." At least 10 entries.
2. **Identify listening pattern** — ratio of listening:talking, questions:statements, body language.
3. **Script first 5 interactions** — literal scripts for common situations.
4. **Practice low stakes** — casual conversations. Record what happened.
5. **Adapt to personality** — rewrite in your words, keeping STRUCTURE. Structure is the skill.
6. **Read the room live** — every 2 minutes: "What is the other person feeling? What do they want?"
- **Verification:** Similar outcomes 60%+ in similar situations.

### SECTION D: CREATIVE SKILLS
1. **Copy taste** — 20 of their works + 20 works they praised = taste profile.
2. **Build taste rubric** — what do all 40 share? At least 8 specific qualities.
3. **Exact replication** — recreate 3 best works by hand (training, not plagiarism).
4. **Constrained originals** — 5 original pieces scoring high on taste rubric.
5. **Copy process** — how they start, generate, select, refine. Follow exactly for 3 projects.
6. **Find divergence** — where your taste differs. This is YOUR emerging style.
- **Verification:** Work recognizable "in the style of" but with your own consistent choices.

### SECTION E: REACTIVE SKILLS
1. **Pattern library** — situation→response pairs. At least 20.
2. **Flash card drill** — front: situation, back: response. Daily. Target: 90% without hesitation.
3. **Simulate with time pressure** — real time limits. Target: 70%+ correct.
4. **Progressively real conditions** — increase stakes and speed.
5. **Debrief every session** — hit, missed, new? Update library.
- **Verification:** 80% accuracy at full speed AND can explain why.

### SECTION F: TACIT KNOWLEDGE / INTUITION
1. **Accept timeline** — 10 years of their experience ≈ 2-3 years with deliberate work.
2. **Prediction journal** — before EVERY decision: your gut, model's probable gut, confidence. After outcome: what happened, who was closer, what to weight differently. THE #1 TOOL.
3. **Massive volume** — pattern recognition requires patterns. Maximum examples, experienced attentively.
4. **"Feels wrong" signals** — ask about times their bad feeling was right. What felt off?
5. **Copy exposure pattern** — their information diet for 3 months.
6. **Test monthly** — 10 situations, gut before analysis. Track accuracy over time.
- **Verification:** Improving accuracy over 3+ months. Gut matches model 60%+.

### SECTION G: PROCEDURAL SKILLS
1. **Document complete procedure** — every step, including unconscious ones they don't mention.
2. **Compare to documented procedures** — improvements (copy) vs experience-shortcuts (don't copy yet).
3. **Follow literally 5 times** — no improvising. Note sticking points.
4. **Identify judgment-within-procedure** — for judgment steps, apply Section B.
5. **Build speed through repetition** — 20 more correct executions. Track time.
6. **Earn shortcut rights** — after 20+, before skipping ask: "What could go wrong?"
- **Verification:** Comparable time and results. Can explain why each step exists.

## SECTION H: VERIFICATION & MAINTENANCE

### Three Tests:

| Test | Method | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| OUTPUT | Compare results on same tasks | Within 80% of model |
| PREDICTION | Predict model's response to new situations | 75%+ correct |
| EXPLANATION | Explain to third party how and why | They can follow and ask informed questions |

### Maintenance:
- Physical: practice weekly
- Cognitive/judgment: use monthly
- Social: use weekly in real situations
- Creative: produce work monthly
- Reactive: drill bi-weekly
- Tacit: prediction journal indefinitely
- Procedural: execute monthly

### Graduate when OUTPUT consistently >80%. Begin your own modifications.

- [ ] Where their eyes go
- [ ] Sequence of actions
- [ ] Duration of each step
- [ ] What they ignore
- [ ] What triggers changes
- [ ] What they do with hands/body
- [ ] What they say and when
- [ ] What they check or verify

### Card 2: Copy-Method Selection

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Cargo Culting** — copying form without function. For every copied behavior: "This produces better results because ___."
2. **Copying what they SAY, not DO** — validate interviews against observation.
3. **Copying the wrong person** — charisma ≠ competence. Require VERIFIED RESULTS.
4. **Copying everything vs critical few** — 20% produces 80% of results.
5. **Context mismatch** — "Does this work because of PERSON or SITUATION?"
6. **Giving up too early** — 20 repetitions minimum. First 10 feel terrible. Expected.
7. **Innate advantage mismatch** — find models with similar profiles.
8. **Copying performance, not preparation** — "What do you do BEFORE the visible performance?"

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE

1. Person not actually skilled (luck/connections) — find new model
2. 30+ attempts, consistently worse — wrong aspect, wrong model, or genuine mismatch
3. Person asks you to stop — switch to Method C or new model
4. You surpass model — stop copying, start innovating
5. Skill changing rapidly — verify currency

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Presentation Skills
Alex holds rooms 45 min; yours lose people at 10. Social Skill. Decomposition: question opening, movement from podium, eye contact, pauses, image-only slides, story in first 5 min, audience question every 10 min, one-sentence close. Key extraction: "Slides are for audience, not you" + "three points maximum." After 4 presentations: survey 3.2→4.1/5.

### Example 2: Debugging Speed
Kenji: 15 min. You: 2 hours. Procedural + Tacit. Procedure: read full error, reproduce, check recent changes, stack trace bottom-up, state hypothesis, write triggering test, bisect. Key extraction: "Mental list of 10 most common bug types — check those first." After 1 month: 2 hours→35 minutes.

### Example 3: Startup Investment Intuition
Diana's portfolio 3x market. Tacit + Judgment. Reverse engineering 30 investments: 80% repeat founders, 90% pre-investment customers. Key: "Worst investments = fell in love with technology, ignored founder." After 6 months prediction journaling: 65% accuracy on her invest/pass decisions.
