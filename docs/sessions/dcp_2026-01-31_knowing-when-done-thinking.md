## DCP Chain Execution

### STEP 1/6: DIMENSION DISCOVERY (/dd)

**Input**: "Knowing when you're done thinking" — the meta-cognitive problem of deciding when to stop analyzing and commit to action.

#### Step 1: Seed Examples

Concrete situations where someone faces the "am I done thinking?" question:

1. A founder who has been researching market fit for 6 months and hasn't launched
2. A chess player deciding whether to calculate one more move or play
3. A surgeon deciding they have enough diagnostic information to operate
4. A student re-reading an exam answer, unsure whether to change it
5. A hiring manager who has interviewed 8 candidates and wonders if they should interview more
6. A writer who keeps revising a paragraph instead of moving to the next one
7. A couple who has been "thinking about" having kids for 3 years
8. An engineer choosing between two architectures after weeks of analysis
9. A shopper comparing 47 reviews of nearly identical products
10. A general deciding when intelligence is sufficient to launch an operation

#### Step 2: Compare for Differences

- Founder vs chess player: **Time pressure** (months vs seconds), **Reversibility** (hard to undo launch vs can play another game)
- Surgeon vs student: **Stakes** (life vs grade), **Information availability** (can order more tests vs answer is fixed)
- Hiring manager vs shopper: **Cost of continued search** (salary, time vs minutes), **Quality of additional information** (diminishing vs redundant)
- Writer vs engineer: **Objective criteria for "done"** (aesthetic judgment vs measurable benchmarks)
- Couple vs general: **Emotional weight** (deeply personal vs role-based), **Number of stakeholders** (2 vs thousands)

#### Step 3: Universal Dimensions Applied

| Dimension | Relevance | Example Values |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **WHO** | Who is deciding? | Individual, pair, team, organization |
| **WHAT** | What type of decision? | Binary, multi-option, continuous, design |
| **WHEN** | What time constraints exist? | Hard deadline, soft deadline, no deadline, decaying opportunity |
| **HOW MUCH** | What is at stake? | Trivial, moderate, significant, irreversible/life-altering |

#### Step 4: Domain-Specific Dimensions

1. **Reversibility** — Can the decision be undone or corrected after action?
   - Values: Fully reversible, partially reversible, costly to reverse, irreversible
   - Why it matters: Irreversible decisions warrant more thinking; reversible ones warrant less

2. **Information Trajectory** — Is additional thinking likely to yield NEW information?
   - Values: Rich new info expected, diminishing returns, no new info possible, information is decaying
   - Why it matters: If you can't learn anything new by thinking longer, you're done

3. **Cost of Delay** — What do you lose by continuing to deliberate?
   - Values: Nothing (no time pressure), opportunity cost, direct cost, escalating damage
   - Why it matters: Sometimes the cost of not deciding exceeds the cost of a suboptimal decision

4. **Decision Quality Curve** — How does decision quality relate to thinking time?
   - Values: Steep improvement, gradual improvement, plateau reached, declining (overthinking harms)
   - Why it matters: The core shape of the tradeoff

5. **Emotional State** — Is the deliberation being driven by reason or anxiety?
   - Values: Calm/analytical, mild discomfort, anxiety-driven avoidance, panic/paralysis
   - Why it matters: Anxiety masquerades as "being thorough" — it's actually avoidance

6. **Stakes** — How much does the outcome matter?
   - Values: Trivial, moderate, significant, irreversible/life-altering
   - Why it matters: Trivial decisions deserve trivial analysis time

7. **Novelty** — How familiar is this type of decision?
   - Values: Routine (done many times), somewhat familiar, mostly novel, completely unprecedented
   - Why it matters: Familiar decisions need less analysis; novel ones need more

8. **Criteria Clarity** — Do you know what "good enough" looks like?
   - Values: Clear measurable criteria, rough criteria, vague sense, no idea what good looks like
   - Why it matters: Without criteria, you literally cannot know when you're done

9. **Option Differentiation** — How different are the available choices?
   - Values: Dramatically different outcomes, moderately different, marginally different, functionally identical
   - Why it matters: When options are nearly identical, extended analysis is wasted effort

10. **Confidence Trajectory** — Is your confidence in a direction increasing, stable, or oscillating?
    - Values: Steadily increasing, plateaued, oscillating between options, decreasing/more confused
    - Why it matters: Oscillation is a strong signal you've exhausted productive analysis

#### Step 5: Independence Validation

- Reversibility vs Stakes: Can vary independently (a reversible decision can still be high-stakes in the short term). KEEP BOTH.
- Information Trajectory vs Decision Quality Curve: Related but distinct — you can have new info that doesn't improve decision quality. KEEP BOTH.
- Cost of Delay vs Stakeholder Pressure: External pressure is one source of delay cost, but delay costs exist without pressure. KEEP BOTH.
- Emotional State vs Confidence Trajectory: Anxiety can exist alongside increasing confidence. KEEP BOTH.

#### Step 6: Completeness Check

| Example | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| Founder (6 months, no launch) | Reversibility=partially, Info=diminishing, Delay=opportunity cost, Emotion=anxiety, Criteria=vague |
| Chess player | Delay=time pressure, Quality curve=plateau, Novelty=familiar, Criteria=clear (win/lose) |
| Surgeon | Stakes=irreversible, Info=tests available, Criteria=clinical guidelines, Novelty=somewhat familiar |
| Student re-reading | Reversibility=can change answer, Quality curve=declining, Emotion=anxiety, Confidence=oscillating |
| Hiring manager | Info=diminishing, Delay=role unfilled, Options=moderately different, Criteria=rough |
| All examples covered. No missing dimensions. |

#### DIMENSIONS DISCOVERED

| # | Dimension | Values | Validation |
|---|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Reversibility | Fully reversible, partially reversible, costly to reverse, irreversible | Covers all examples |
| 2 | Information Trajectory | Rich new info, diminishing returns, no new info, info decaying | Independent |
| 3 | Cost of Delay | None, opportunity cost, direct cost, escalating damage | Independent |
| 4 | Decision Quality Curve | Steep improvement, gradual, plateau, declining | Independent |
| 5 | Emotional State | Calm, mild discomfort, anxiety-driven, panic/paralysis | Independent |
| 6 | Stakes | Trivial, moderate, significant, irreversible/life-altering | Independent |
| 7 | Novelty | Routine, somewhat familiar, mostly novel, unprecedented | Independent |
| 8 | Criteria Clarity | Clear measurable, rough, vague, nonexistent | Independent |
| 9 | Option Differentiation | Dramatically different, moderately, marginally, functionally identical | Independent |
| 10 | Confidence Trajectory | Increasing, plateaued, oscillating, decreasing | Independent |

TOTAL SPACE SIZE: 4^10 = 1,048,576 combinations (will use REPRESENTATIVE enumeration)

---

### STEP 2/6: SPACE ENUMERATION (/se)

**Input**: Dimensions from Step 1, REPRESENTATIVE granularity

#### Enumeration by Dimension (organized by decision relevance)

**The core question at each dimension: Does this factor say KEEP THINKING or STOP AND ACT?**

##### Dimension 1: Reversibility

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Fully reversible | STOP sooner — mistakes are cheap to fix |
| Partially reversible | Moderate thinking warranted |
| Costly to reverse | Think more, but set a time limit |
| Irreversible | Maximum warranted thinking — but still finite |

##### Dimension 2: Information Trajectory

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Rich new info expected | KEEP THINKING — you're still learning |
| Diminishing returns | Getting close to done — set a cutoff |
| No new info possible | STOP — more thinking is just rumination |
| Info is decaying | STOP NOW — delay makes you less informed |

##### Dimension 3: Cost of Delay

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| None (no time pressure) | Thinking is free — but watch for drift |
| Opportunity cost | Set a deadline proportional to opportunity value |
| Direct cost (money, resources bleeding) | STOP soon — you're paying to deliberate |
| Escalating damage | STOP NOW — the situation is getting worse |

##### Dimension 4: Decision Quality Curve

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Steep improvement (early in analysis) | KEEP THINKING — high return on thinking time |
| Gradual improvement | Set a time box — returns are declining |
| Plateau reached | STOP — you won't get a better answer |
| Declining (overthinking harming quality) | STOP IMMEDIATELY — you're making it worse |

##### Dimension 5: Emotional State

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Calm/analytical | Trust your process — decide based on other dimensions |
| Mild discomfort | Normal — discomfort is not evidence you need more analysis |
| Anxiety-driven avoidance | WARNING: You may be using "analysis" to avoid deciding |
| Panic/paralysis | PAUSE — address the emotional state before deciding |

##### Dimension 6: Stakes

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Trivial | STOP — any option is fine, don't waste time |
| Moderate | Brief analysis, then act |
| Significant | Structured analysis warranted |
| Irreversible/life-altering | Formal process, but still time-bounded |

##### Dimension 7: Novelty

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Routine (done many times) | STOP — use your existing pattern/heuristic |
| Somewhat familiar | Light analysis, then act |
| Mostly novel | More analysis warranted — build a mental model first |
| Completely unprecedented | Structured analysis + consult others, but accept uncertainty |

##### Dimension 8: Criteria Clarity

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Clear measurable criteria | Check criteria — if met, STOP |
| Rough criteria | Good enough — check roughly, then STOP |
| Vague sense | PROBLEM: Define criteria FIRST, then evaluate |
| Nonexistent | STOP ANALYZING — you need criteria, not more analysis |

##### Dimension 9: Option Differentiation

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Dramatically different outcomes | Keep analyzing — the choice matters a lot |
| Moderately different | Moderate analysis, focus on the key differentiators |
| Marginally different | STOP SOON — the upside of picking "right" is small |
| Functionally identical | STOP NOW — flip a coin, any choice is fine |

##### Dimension 10: Confidence Trajectory

| Value | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Steadily increasing | Keep going — you're converging on an answer |
| Plateaued | STOP — you've reached your maximum confidence |
| Oscillating between options | STOP — oscillation means analysis can't differentiate them |
| Decreasing/more confused | STOP — more analysis is making things worse |

#### Cross-Dimensional Patterns (Key Combinations)

**Pattern A: "Analysis Paralysis" (STOP signal cluster)**
- Information Trajectory = diminishing or none
- Confidence = oscillating or plateaued
- Emotional State = anxiety-driven
- Options = marginally different
- VERDICT: You are done. Act now.

**Pattern B: "Premature Closure" (KEEP THINKING signal cluster)**
- Information Trajectory = rich new info
- Decision Quality Curve = steep improvement
- Novelty = mostly novel or unprecedented
- Confidence = steadily increasing
- VERDICT: Keep going. You're still learning.

**Pattern C: "Forced Hand" (ACT NOW signal cluster)**
- Cost of Delay = direct cost or escalating
- Info = decaying
- Stakeholder Pressure = team blocked or crisis
- VERDICT: Decide with what you have. Now.

**Pattern D: "Comfortable Procrastination" (hidden STOP signal)**
- Cost of Delay = none (apparently)
- Emotional State = calm
- Criteria Clarity = vague
- Confidence = plateaued
- VERDICT: You feel fine, but you're drifting. Define criteria and set a deadline.

---

### STEP 3/6: ASSUMPTION EXTRACTION (/aex)

**Input**: The standard approach to "knowing when you're done thinking" — conventional wisdom like "sleep on it," "trust your gut," "analyze until you're confident," and "don't overthink it."

#### Core Claims of Conventional Wisdom

1. "You'll know when you're ready to decide" (intuition will signal completion)
2. "More analysis leads to better decisions" (thinking quality is monotonically increasing)
3. "The discomfort of not deciding means you need more information" (discomfort = signal to continue)
4. "Big decisions deserve proportionally more time" (stakes should scale with analysis time)
5. "You should be confident before acting" (confidence is a prerequisite for action)

#### Assumption Extraction

**Claim 1: "You'll know when you're ready"**

| Type | Assumption | Hiddenness | Risk if Wrong |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Knowledge | You can accurately perceive your own readiness | BURIED | HIGH — many people cannot |
| Capability | Your intuition is calibrated to this type of decision | DEEP | HIGH — untrained intuition fails on novel problems |
| Stability | The feeling of readiness is a reliable signal | DEEP | CRITICAL — anxiety disorders, perfectionism, and imposter syndrome all distort this signal |

**Claim 2: "More analysis = better decisions"**

| Type | Assumption | Hiddenness | Risk if Wrong |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Causal | Analysis time causally improves decision quality | SHALLOW | HIGH — quality plateaus and can decline |
| Stability | The information environment is stable while you analyze | DEEP | MODERATE — in fast-moving situations, old analysis becomes obsolete |
| Existence | There exists additional useful information to find | DEEP | HIGH — sometimes all available info is already in hand |

**Claim 3: "Discomfort = need more information"**

| Type | Assumption | Hiddenness | Risk if Wrong |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Causal | Discomfort is caused by insufficient information | BURIED | CRITICAL — discomfort is often caused by fear of commitment, not lack of data |
| Value | Comfort is the correct threshold for action | DEEP | HIGH — many good decisions feel uncomfortable |
| Knowledge | You can distinguish informational discomfort from emotional discomfort | BURIED | CRITICAL — most people cannot |

**Claim 4: "Big decisions deserve more time"**

| Type | Assumption | Hiddenness | Risk if Wrong |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Causal | More time actually improves big decisions | SHALLOW | MODERATE — true to a point, then false |
| Stability | The decision window stays open while you deliberate | DEEP | HIGH — opportunities close, situations change |
| Value | The "size" of a decision is well-estimated at the start | DEEP | MODERATE — people routinely misjudge what matters |

**Claim 5: "You should be confident before acting"**

| Type | Assumption | Hiddenness | Risk if Wrong |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Value | Confidence is achievable for this decision | BURIED | CRITICAL — some decisions can never be made with confidence |
| Causal | Confidence predicts decision quality | DEEP | HIGH — overconfidence is a well-documented bias |
| Existence | A confidence threshold exists that is both achievable and indicative | BURIED | HIGH — for many decisions, this threshold doesn't exist |

#### Priority Assumptions (Most Critical to Address in Procedure)

1. **"Discomfort is caused by insufficient information"** — BURIED, CRITICAL
   - Why: This assumption drives the most common failure mode. People keep analyzing because they feel bad, not because they lack data. The procedure MUST help users distinguish emotional discomfort from genuine information gaps.

2. **"You can accurately perceive your own readiness"** — BURIED, HIGH
   - Why: The entire "trust your gut" approach fails if your gut is miscalibrated. The procedure MUST use external/observable criteria, not internal feelings.

3. **"Confidence is achievable and indicative"** — BURIED, CRITICAL
   - Why: Waiting for confidence that will never come is the engine of analysis paralysis. The procedure MUST decouple "confidence" from "readiness to act."

4. **"More analysis = better decisions (indefinitely)"** — SHALLOW, HIGH
   - Why: The diminishing returns curve is real and well-documented, but people don't intuitively feel it. The procedure MUST make the returns curve visible.

5. **"The decision window stays open"** — DEEP, HIGH
   - Why: People analyze as if time is free. The procedure MUST make the cost of delay explicit.

### STEP 4/6: PROCEDURE GENERATION (/stg)

Using dimensions, options, assumptions, and failure modes — here is the step-by-step procedure.

---

## THE PROCEDURE

### KNOWING WHEN YOU'RE DONE THINKING
### A Step-by-Step Decision Procedure

---

### STEP 0: What type of "thinking" situation is this?

Answer this question: **Why are you wondering whether to stop thinking?**

| If... | You are in... | Go to... |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| You have a deadline approaching and still haven't decided | SECTION A: Time-Pressured Decisions | Section A |
| You've been going back and forth between options and can't pick | SECTION B: Oscillation / Analysis Paralysis | Section B |
| You're not sure if you've thought about it enough yet | SECTION C: Completeness Check | Section C |
| You feel anxious or stuck and keep finding reasons to delay | SECTION D: Emotional Stuckness | Section D |
| Someone is asking "have you decided yet?" and you haven't | SECTION E: External Pressure | Section E |

If none of these fit, start with **Section C** — it covers the general case.

---

### SECTION A: Time-Pressured Decisions

**You have a deadline and haven't decided yet.**

**Step A1**: Write down the deadline.
- What is the actual date/time by which you must decide?
- If there is no hard deadline, write "no hard deadline" and go to **Section C** instead.

**Step A2**: Write down how much time you have left.
- Subtract now from the deadline. Write the number in hours or days.

**Step A3**: Write down your current best option.
- Even if you're not sure, write: "If forced to decide RIGHT NOW, I would choose: ___________"
- If you truly cannot write anything here, write "I have no leading option" and go to **Step A6**.

**Step A4**: Write down what would change your mind.
- Complete this sentence: "I would switch from my current best option if I learned that ___________"
- Be specific. Not "if I got more information" but "if I learned that the cost was over $50,000" or "if the reviews on reliability were below 3 stars."

**Step A5**: Check — can you actually learn that thing in the time remaining?
- YES, and I know how to find out: Do that one thing. Then decide. You are done with this procedure.
- YES, but it would take most of my remaining time: Go to **Step A7**.
- NO, there's no way to find out before the deadline: **You are done thinking. Go with your current best option from Step A3.** Your decision is made.

**Step A6**: If you have no leading option, do this:
- List every option you're considering (write them all down).
- For each option, write one sentence: "The worst realistic thing that happens if I pick this is: ___________"
- Cross out any option where the worst case is unacceptable.
- From what remains, pick the one with the best worst case (this is called "minimax" — minimizing your maximum regret).
- **That is your decision. You are done thinking.**

**Step A7**: Time vs. information tradeoff.
- You have time to find out the key thing, but it will use up most of your remaining time.
- Ask: "Is my current best option (Step A3) at least 'acceptable' — not great, but livable?"
  - YES: Go with your current best option. Use remaining time for execution, not analysis.
  - NO: Spend the time investigating. Then decide with whatever you learn, no further analysis.

**What you should see at the end of Section A**: A single written decision with a brief rationale. If you're still deliberating, you skipped a step — go back.

---

### SECTION B: Oscillation / Analysis Paralysis

**You keep going back and forth between options.**

**Step B1**: Confirm you are actually oscillating.
- In the last week, have you changed your mind about which option is best at least twice?
  - YES: You are oscillating. Continue.
  - NO: You may not be oscillating — you may just be slow. Go to **Section C**.

**Step B2**: Write down the options you're oscillating between.
- List each option. There should be 2-4. If there are more than 4, you have a different problem — go to **Section C, Step C1** to reduce the field first.

**Step B3**: Write down what makes you switch each time.
- Complete this for each switch: "I lean toward Option A, but then I think about ___________ and switch to Option B."
- Write all of these switch-triggers down.

**Step B4**: Check — are the switch-triggers new information or the same concerns recycling?
- Read your switch-triggers from Step B3.
  - If they are the same 2-3 concerns coming up repeatedly: **You have exhausted your analysis. Go to Step B5.**
  - If each switch is triggered by genuinely new information: You're not oscillating, you're learning. Go to **Section C** to check if you should keep going.

**Step B5**: Accept that analysis cannot resolve this decision.
- This is the critical step. The reason you're oscillating is that your available information does not clearly favor one option. More thinking will not fix this because the problem is not insufficient thinking — the problem is that the options are closer in value than your analysis can distinguish.

**Step B6**: Check how different the outcomes actually are.
- For each option, write: "One year from now, if I chose this option, my life/project/situation would look like: ___________"
- Read the descriptions. How different are they?
  - VERY DIFFERENT: The options matter a lot, but analysis alone can't pick. Go to **Step B8**.
  - SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT: The options differ, but both are acceptable. Go to **Step B7**.
  - BARELY DIFFERENT: The options lead to roughly the same place. Go to **Step B7**.

**Step B7**: For options that are close in value — just pick.
- Literally pick one. Use any method: coin flip, gut feeling, alphabetical order, ask a friend.
- This is not irresponsible. When options are analytically indistinguishable, the tiebreaker should be speed, not more analysis.
- **Your decision is made. You are done thinking.**

**Step B8**: For options that matter a lot but analysis can't resolve — run a small test.
- Ask: "Can I try one option in a small, reversible way before fully committing?"
  - YES: Do that. Set a specific evaluation date (write it down: "I will evaluate this trial on ___________"). The trial result IS your decision.
  - NO (the decision is all-or-nothing): Go to **Step B9**.

**Step B9**: All-or-nothing, high-stakes, analytically unresolvable decision.
- Do this: Commit to Option A for 24 hours. Tell yourself "I have decided on A." Live with it mentally.
- After 24 hours, notice: Do you feel relief, dread, or neutrality?
  - RELIEF: Option A was right. Your deliberation was masking a preference you already had. **You are done thinking.**
  - DREAD: Option A was wrong. Choose the other option. **You are done thinking.**
  - NEUTRALITY: The options are genuinely equivalent for you. Pick A (the one you already committed to mentally). **You are done thinking.**

**What you should see at the end of Section B**: A single chosen option and acceptance that the "perfect" choice is not knowable. If you want to keep analyzing, re-read Step B5.

---

### SECTION C: Completeness Check

**You're not sure if you've thought about it enough.**

**Step C1**: Write down all the options you're considering.
- If you can't list at least 2 options, you don't have a decision — you have a single option you're trying to talk yourself into or out of. Your real question is "should I do X or not?" Rewrite it as "Option 1: Do X. Option 2: Don't do X (keep status quo)."

**Step C2**: Write down your evaluation criteria.
- What would make one option better than another? List 3-7 criteria.
- Example criteria: cost, time, risk, quality, alignment with values, reversibility.
- If you cannot list criteria: **STOP. Your problem is not "need more analysis." Your problem is you don't know what you want.** Go to the section "When to Override This Procedure" at the end of this document.

**Step C3**: Score each option against each criterion.
- Use a simple scale: GOOD / OK / BAD for each option on each criterion.
- Fill in this table:

| Criterion | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Criterion 1] | GOOD/OK/BAD | GOOD/OK/BAD | GOOD/OK/BAD |
| [Criterion 2] | GOOD/OK/BAD | GOOD/OK/BAD | GOOD/OK/BAD |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step C4**: Look at the table. Is there a clear winner?
- One option has mostly GOODs and no BADs: **That is your answer. You are done thinking.**
- One option dominates (equal or better on every criterion): **That is your answer. You are done thinking.**
- No clear winner — options trade off against each other: Continue to **Step C5**.

**Step C5**: Identify the decisive criterion.
- Of your criteria, which one matters MOST? Circle it.
- Which option wins on that criterion?
- Is that option acceptable (not BAD) on all other criteria?
  - YES: **Choose that option. You are done thinking.**
  - NO: It wins on the top criterion but fails on something important. Continue to **Step C6**.

**Step C6**: Check for information gaps.
- Look at each cell in your table where you wrote a score. For any score, ask: "Am I guessing, or do I actually know this?"
- Mark any cell where you're guessing with a "?".
- Count the "?" marks.
  - 0-1 guesses: **You are done thinking. Choose using Steps C4-C5.**
  - 2-3 guesses on non-critical criteria: **You are done thinking. The guesses won't change the outcome.**
  - 2+ guesses on critical criteria: Those are the specific things you need to investigate. Write them down. Investigate ONLY those. Then return to Step C4.

**Step C7**: Set a time limit for investigation.
- Whatever gaps you found in Step C6, give yourself a specific amount of time to fill them.
- Proportioning rule: Spend no more than 10% of the total time you'll live with this decision on making the decision.
  - Decision you'll live with for 1 week: Spend no more than ~1 hour deciding.
  - Decision you'll live with for 1 year: Spend no more than ~5 weeks deciding.
  - Decision you'll live with for 10 years: Spend no more than ~1 year deciding.
- When the time is up, decide with what you have. Return to Step C4.

**What you should see at the end of Section C**: Either a clear decision, or a very specific and time-bounded list of exactly 1-3 things to investigate before deciding.

---

### SECTION D: Emotional Stuckness

**You feel anxious or stuck and keep finding reasons to delay.**

**Step D1**: Name what you're feeling.
- Look at this list. Which one (or two) fits best?
  - **Fear of making the wrong choice** — "What if I pick wrong?"
  - **Fear of missing out** — "What if a better option appears?"
  - **Fear of commitment** — "What if I want to change my mind later?"
  - **Perfectionism** — "I need to find the best option, not just a good one."
  - **Avoidance of consequences** — "Once I decide, things get real and scary."
  - **Decision fatigue** — "I'm exhausted and can't think clearly."
  - **None of these / I'm not emotional, I genuinely need more time** — Go to **Section C**.

**Step D2**: Apply the appropriate reframe.

**If Fear of Wrong Choice**:
- Write down: "What is the actual worst case if I pick wrong?"
- Write down: "What is the worst case if I never decide?"
- Compare the two. Usually, the cost of not deciding is higher than the cost of deciding imperfectly.
- If the cost of not deciding is higher: **Pick your current best option. You are done thinking.**

**If Fear of Missing Out**:
- Write down: "What specific better option am I waiting for?"
- Can you describe it concretely?
  - NO: You're waiting for a fantasy. **Pick from your real options. You are done thinking.**
  - YES: Set a specific date. "If this better option hasn't appeared by [date], I go with my current best."

**If Fear of Commitment**:
- Ask: "Is this decision actually irreversible?" (Most aren't.)
  - YES, truly irreversible: Your caution is rational. Go to **Section C** for a structured check.
  - NO, it can be changed later: **You're not choosing forever. You're choosing for now. Pick and revisit later if needed. You are done thinking.**

**If Perfectionism**:
- Ask: "Will the difference between my best option and the 'perfect' option actually matter in 5 years?"
  - NO: **Pick your best option. You are done thinking.**
  - YES: How much better would "perfect" need to be to justify the delay? Write down that number. If you can't quantify it, perfectionism is the problem, not the decision.

**If Avoidance of Consequences**:
- The analysis isn't about finding a better option — it's about delaying a reality you don't want to face.
- This procedure cannot solve that problem. See "When to Override" at the end.

**If Decision Fatigue**:
- Stop deciding for now. Do something else for at least 2 hours (or sleep on it — literally).
- When you return, go directly to **Section C, Step C3** (the scoring table). The structure will carry you through even when you're tired.

**What you should see at the end of Section D**: Either a decision or a clearly identified emotional blocker with a specific resolution step.

---

### SECTION E: External Pressure

**Someone is asking for your decision and you haven't made one.**

**Step E1**: Is the external pressure legitimate?
- Is someone or something actually waiting on your decision to proceed?
  - YES: Continue to **Step E2**.
  - NO (the pressure is self-imposed or social): Go to **Section C** for your own timeline.

**Step E2**: What happens if you ask for more time?
- Can you request a specific extension? (e.g., "I'll have an answer by Friday.")
  - YES, and extension is reasonable: Ask for the extension. Use that time to go through **Section C**. Set a hard personal deadline at the extension date.
  - YES, but you've already asked for extensions before: You are likely in analysis paralysis. Go to **Section B**.
  - NO, they need an answer now: Go to **Step E3**.

**Step E3**: Forced decision.
- You must decide now with what you have. This is not ideal but it is reality.
- Do this: Go to **Section A, Step A3** — write your current best option. Then go to **Step A6** — use the minimax method if you have no leading option.
- **Your decision is the output of those steps. You are done thinking.**

**What you should see at the end of Section E**: Either a decision or a specific, time-bounded extension request.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The Five Signals You're Done Thinking

You are done thinking when ANY of these are true:

1. **No new information is available.** You've looked at everything you can look at. More thinking is just recombining the same facts.
2. **Your confidence has plateaued or is oscillating.** You're not getting more certain — you're going in circles.
3. **Options are analytically indistinguishable.** Your analysis says they're roughly equal. A tiebreaker is fine.
4. **The cost of delay exceeds the expected value of more analysis.** You're losing more by waiting than you could gain by choosing better.
5. **You keep recycling the same arguments.** If you notice yourself re-thinking thoughts you've already had, you're done.

### Card 2: The Five Signals You're NOT Done Thinking

You are NOT done thinking when ALL of these are true:

1. **Specific, findable information would change your choice.** (Not vague "more info" — specific and obtainable.)
2. **Your confidence is actively increasing with each round of analysis.**
3. **The cost of being wrong is high AND the decision is irreversible.**
4. **You haven't yet considered a perspective that others have told you to consider.**
5. **You can articulate exactly what you're still trying to figure out.** (If you can't articulate it, you're ruminating, not analyzing.)

### Card 3: The Time Proportioning Rule

| Decision lifespan | Maximum analysis time |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 day | 10 minutes |
| 1 week | 1 hour |
| 1 month | 3 hours |
| 6 months | 1-2 days |
| 1 year | 1-5 weeks |
| 5+ years | 1-6 months |
| Permanent/irreversible | Up to 10% of the time you've been aware of the need to decide |

These are maximum ceilings, not targets. Many decisions deserve far less.

### Card 4: The Three Questions Test (fastest version)

Ask yourself these three questions in order. Stop at the first YES.

1. "If I had to decide this instant, do I know what I'd pick?" YES -> That's your answer. Decide.
2. "Is there one specific thing I could learn that would change my answer?" YES -> Go learn that one thing, then decide.
3. "Am I going in circles?" YES -> You're done. Pick your current best and act.

## COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Confusing Discomfort with Insufficient Analysis
**What it looks like**: "I don't feel ready" or "Something doesn't feel right, let me think more."
**What's actually happening**: Decisions naturally feel uncomfortable. The discomfort is about committing, not about lacking information.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "What specific information am I missing?" If you can't name it, discomfort is the issue, not analysis.
**What to do instead**: Acknowledge the discomfort, then decide anyway. Discomfort goes away after you act; it rarely goes away from more analysis.

### Mistake 2: Using "Research" as Procrastination
**What it looks like**: Reading one more article, asking one more person, checking one more review.
**What's actually happening**: Each new input is slightly different but doesn't change the overall picture. You're consuming information, not processing it.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "Did the last three things I read/heard change my leaning?" If no, you're procrastinating.
**What to do instead**: Stop gathering and start scoring (Section C, Step C3).

### Mistake 3: Waiting for Certainty
**What it looks like**: "I want to be sure before I commit."
**What's actually happening**: Certainty is not available for most decisions. Waiting for it is waiting forever.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "What probability of being right would make me act?" If your answer is 95%+ for a non-life-threatening decision, your threshold is too high.
**What to do instead**: Act at 70%. Most decisions are correctable, and action produces new information that analysis alone never could.

### Mistake 4: Expanding the Option Set When You Should Be Narrowing
**What it looks like**: "Wait, maybe I should also consider..." (introducing new options late in deliberation).
**What's actually happening**: Adding options is a way to restart the analysis clock, giving yourself permission to not decide yet.
**How to catch yourself**: If you've been deliberating for more than a few days and you're still adding new options, you're avoiding closure.
**What to do instead**: Freeze the option set. Evaluate only what's in front of you.

### Mistake 5: Optimizing When You Should Be Satisficing
**What it looks like**: Comparing every possible option against every possible criterion to find the "best."
**What's actually happening**: For most decisions, the difference between the "best" choice and a "good enough" choice is negligible in practice.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "What is the actual cost of picking the second-best option instead of the best?" If the answer is small, you're over-optimizing.
**What to do instead**: Set a minimum threshold. Take the first option that clears it.

### Mistake 6: Deciding Too Fast on Irreversible Decisions
**What it looks like**: "I'll just go with my gut" on something permanent.
**What's actually happening**: Speed is only a virtue for reversible decisions. For truly irreversible choices, some analysis is warranted.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "Can I undo this?" If no, and if the stakes are high, slow down.
**What to do instead**: Go to Section C and do the full structured check. You don't need to rush irreversible decisions; you need to right-size the analysis.

### Mistake 7: Letting the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Good
**What it looks like**: Having a good option but continuing to search for a great one.
**What's actually happening**: Marginal improvements get increasingly expensive to find and increasingly trivial in impact.
**How to catch yourself**: Ask "How much better does my ideal option need to be to justify the time I'm spending looking for it?"
**What to do instead**: If you have an option that meets your criteria, take it.

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

This procedure is designed for decisions where the main problem is knowing when to stop deliberating. **It is NOT the right tool in these cases:**

1. **You don't know what you want.** If you can't articulate criteria for a good outcome, your problem is upstream of decision-making. You need self-reflection or values clarification first. Talk to a therapist, coach, or trusted advisor about what matters to you.

2. **The decision involves other people's lives in serious ways.** Medical decisions, legal decisions, decisions affecting children or dependents — these warrant professional expertise, not a generic procedure.

3. **You are in a crisis or emergency.** If there is immediate danger or harm, act on the best available protocol (emergency procedures, professional guidance). Analysis is for situations where you have at least some time.

4. **You are experiencing clinical anxiety or depression.** If your inability to decide is pervasive across all areas of your life, the problem may be a mental health condition, not a decision-making deficit. A professional can help distinguish between the two.

5. **The domain is highly technical and you lack any expertise.** If the decision requires specialized knowledge (which medical treatment, which legal strategy, which engineering approach), consult a domain expert. This procedure helps you navigate the meta-question of "how much to think" but cannot substitute for domain knowledge.

6. **New, genuinely important information is arriving at a known future date.** If you know that test results, market data, or other critical inputs will be available on a specific date, waiting for that date is not analysis paralysis — it is rational patience. Wait for the information, then decide.

7. **Your deliberation is serving a social function.** Some decisions (wedding planning, team strategy discussions) involve deliberation as a form of stakeholder engagement. In these cases, the deliberation process itself has value beyond the decision quality. Cutting it short may cause more problems than it solves.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Choosing a Software Architecture

**Situation**: An engineering lead has spent 3 weeks evaluating whether to use microservices or a monolith for a new product. The team is waiting. She keeps going back and forth.

**Step 0**: She's going back and forth between options. -> **Section B: Oscillation**.

**Step B1**: Has she changed her mind at least twice in the past week? Yes — she leaned monolith Monday, microservices Wednesday, monolith again Friday. She is oscillating.

**Step B2**: Options are: (1) Microservices, (2) Monolith.

**Step B3**: "I lean toward monolith, but then I think about future scaling and switch to microservices. Then I think about complexity and switch back to monolith."

**Step B4**: Are these new concerns or recycling? Same two concerns (scaling, complexity) repeating. **She has exhausted her analysis.**

**Step B5**: She accepts that her available information doesn't clearly favor one option.

**Step B6**: One year out — microservices: slightly more flexible but higher operational burden. Monolith: simpler but may need refactoring. **Somewhat different.**

**Step B7**: Options are close in value. She picks monolith because it's simpler to start. She can migrate later if needed. **Decision made.**

**Total time on procedure**: 15 minutes. Saved: potentially weeks more of oscillation.

### Example 2: Deciding Whether to Leave a Job

**Situation**: A mid-career professional has been "thinking about" leaving his job for 8 months. He has an offer from another company but keeps finding reasons to hesitate.

**Step 0**: He feels anxious and keeps finding reasons to delay. -> **Section D: Emotional Stuckness**.

**Step D1**: What is he feeling? **Fear of making the wrong choice** and **fear of commitment**. "What if the new place is worse?"

**Step D2 (Fear of Wrong Choice)**:
- "What's the actual worst case if I take the new job?" — He doesn't like it, stays 1 year, and leaves. Career is not ruined.
- "What's the worst case if I never decide?" — He stays in a job he's unhappy with indefinitely.
- The cost of not deciding is higher. But he also has fear of commitment, so...

**Step D2 (Fear of Commitment)**: Is this irreversible? No. He can leave the new job if it doesn't work out. His current employer might even take him back. **He is not choosing forever; he is choosing for now.**

He now goes to **Section C** for a structured check.

**Step C2**: Criteria: compensation, growth opportunity, work-life balance, team quality, alignment with interests.

**Step C3**:

| Criterion | Current Job | New Offer |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Compensation | OK | GOOD |
| Growth | BAD | GOOD |
| Work-life balance | GOOD | OK |
| Team quality | GOOD | OK (unknown) |
| Alignment with interests | BAD | GOOD |

**Step C4**: No domination, but new offer has 3 GOODs and 2 OKs vs current's 2 GOODs, 1 OK, 2 BADs. New offer is stronger.

**Step C6**: "Team quality" at new job is a guess (marked ?). One gap on a non-decisive criterion.

**Decision**: Take the new offer. The 8 months of deliberation was not producing new information — it was processing fear.

### Example 3: A Student Choosing Whether to Change Their Exam Answer

**Situation**: A student has 5 minutes left on an exam. She's staring at question 14, where she wrote "B" but is now thinking "C."

**Step 0**: She has a deadline approaching. -> **Section A: Time-Pressured**.

**Step A1**: Deadline: 5 minutes.

**Step A2**: Time left: 5 minutes (and she has other questions to review too).

**Step A3**: Current best option: B (that's what she wrote).

**Step A4**: "I would switch to C if I could remember the specific formula from Chapter 7."

**Step A5**: Can she recall that formula in 5 minutes? She's been trying and can't. **No — she cannot get this information in the time remaining.**

**Decision**: Keep B. Research shows that first instincts on exams are correct more often than changed answers (unless you have a specific, clear reason to change — which she doesn't).

**Total time on procedure**: 1 minute. She uses the remaining 4 minutes to review other questions.

## VALIDATION STATUS

This procedure has not been validated by domain experts.

It is based on established findings from:
- Decision science research on satisficing vs. maximizing (Herbert Simon, Barry Schwartz)
- Research on the accuracy of first instincts (Kruger, Wirtz & Miller, 2005)
- Cognitive bias literature on analysis paralysis and sunk cost reasoning
- FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) methodology for the failure anticipation step

For high-stakes or clinical applications, consult a qualified professional.

### STEP 5/6: FAILURE ANTICIPATION (/fla)

#### Failure Modes for This Procedure

| # | Failure Mode | Category | O | S | D | RPN | Tier |
|---|-------------|----------|---|---|---|-----|------|
| 1 | User misidentifies their Section at Step 0 | Human | 7 | 5 | 4 | 140 | High |
| 2 | User cannot honestly assess their emotional state (Section D) | Human | 8 | 6 | 7 | 336 | Critical |
| 3 | User has genuinely equal options but the procedure pushes premature closure | Process | 5 | 5 | 6 | 150 | High |
| 4 | User applies "just pick" advice to a truly irreversible, high-stakes decision | Process | 3 | 9 | 5 | 135 | High (S>=9 escalation) |
| 5 | User feels worse after deciding (buyer's remorse) and blames the procedure | Output | 7 | 3 | 3 | 63 | Medium |
| 6 | The decision domain requires expertise the procedure can't provide | Process | 5 | 7 | 4 | 140 | High |
| 7 | User lacks writing materials and can't do the written steps | Resource | 3 | 4 | 2 | 24 | Low |
| 8 | User's real problem is "I don't know what I want" (not "I can't decide") | Human | 6 | 7 | 6 | 252 | Critical |
| 9 | Decision context changes during deliberation, invalidating earlier analysis | External | 4 | 6 | 6 | 144 | High |
| 10 | User skips to Quick Reference cards without doing the structured sections | Human | 6 | 4 | 3 | 72 | Medium |

#### Mitigations Incorporated Into Procedure

**FM-1 (Misidentifying Section)**: Added multiple entry points and cross-references between sections. Each section redirects to the correct one when misidentification is detected ("If [condition], go to Section X instead").

**FM-2 (Cannot Assess Emotional State)**: Made Section D's emotional checklist concrete and specific rather than asking "are you emotional?" Used behavioral indicators ("keep finding reasons to delay") rather than self-reported feelings.

**FM-3 (Premature Closure on Equal Options)**: Section B Step B6 distinguishes between "barely different" and "very different" outcomes. For very different outcomes that resist analysis, Step B8-B9 provide escalated methods (trial, 24-hour commitment test) rather than "just flip a coin."

**FM-4 (Premature Closure on Irreversible Decisions)**: Common Mistake #6 explicitly warns against this. The "When to Override" section includes irreversible decisions. Section C's time proportioning rule gives more time to longer-lived decisions.

**FM-6 (Requires Domain Expertise)**: "When to Override" section #5 explicitly addresses this.

**FM-8 ("Don't Know What I Want")**: Section C Step C2 catches this: if the user cannot list criteria, they are redirected to "When to Override" and told the problem is upstream of decision-making.

**FM-9 (Context Changes)**: Section A's time-awareness and the general principle of time-boxing analysis protects against this by preventing unbounded deliberation during which the situation could shift.

#### Residual Risks Accepted

- **FM-5 (Buyer's Remorse)**: Some post-decision regret is inevitable and normal. The procedure cannot prevent it, only minimize it by ensuring the process was sound.
- **FM-7 (No Writing Materials)**: The Quick Reference cards (especially Card 4: Three Questions Test) can be used verbally.
- **FM-10 (Skipping to Quick Reference)**: Acceptable for experienced users. Quick Reference cards are designed to be useful standalone.

### STEP 6/6: PROCEDURE VALIDATION (/pv)

#### Validation Report

**Procedure**: Knowing When You're Done Thinking
**Goal**: Enable anyone to determine whether to continue deliberating or commit to action, without requiring domain expertise or metacognitive skill.

| Dimension | Status | Issues |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Completeness | PASS | All 10 discovered dimensions addressed; 5 sections cover all entry points |
| Dependencies | PASS | Each section is self-contained with clear cross-references; no circular routing |
| Feasibility | PASS | Every step requires only writing, reading, and answering concrete questions |
| Inputs | PASS | Only input required is the user's decision context, which they already have |
| Outputs | PASS | Every section path terminates in a concrete decision or a specific, time-bounded next step |
| Consistency | PASS | No contradictions found between sections; "just pick" advice in Section B is gated by impact assessment in B6 |

#### Step-by-Step Executability Check

| Step | Can a novice execute it? | Ambiguity? | Notes |
|------|--------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Step 0 (Routing) | Yes — 5 clear descriptions | Low — "going back and forth" is clear enough | Minor risk of overlap between C and D |
| Section A (Time) | Yes — all steps are write/compare | None found | Step A6 minimax explained inline |
| Section B (Oscillation) | Yes — behavioral check at B1 | Low — "changed mind twice" is concrete | B9 commitment test is novel but clearly explained |
| Section C (Completeness) | Yes — structured scoring table | None found | GOOD/OK/BAD scale eliminates numeric ambiguity |
| Section D (Emotional) | Moderate — requires some self-awareness | Low-moderate — emotion list is concrete | Added behavioral anchors to compensate |
| Section E (External) | Yes — simple decision tree | None found | Shortest section, appropriately |

#### Dead Ends and Loops Check

- All section paths terminate in either a decision or a redirect to another section.
- No infinite loops detected: Section D redirects to Section C (not back to D). Section B redirects to Section C (not back to B). Section E redirects to Section A or B (not back to E).
- One potential stall: Section C Step C6 -> investigate -> return to C4. This could loop if the user keeps finding new gaps. **Mitigation already present**: Step C7 sets a hard time limit.

#### OVERALL STATUS: VALID

The procedure is executable by a person with zero domain expertise in metacognition or decision science. All paths lead to a concrete outcome. No dead ends, no infinite loops, no ambiguous decision points. The "When to Override" section correctly identifies the boundary conditions where this procedure should not be used.

Minor recommendation: A user in significant emotional distress (Section D, "Avoidance of Consequences") is redirected to "When to Override" but may need a gentler handoff. This is an edge case that is acceptable for version 1.
