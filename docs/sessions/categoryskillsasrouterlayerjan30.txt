  The core finding is G53: ARAW is for TESTING (you have the thing, test both sides). UAUA is for DISCOVERING THEN TESTING (you don't have the thing yet, find it first). AR-only is for
   TRACING (assume it's right, follow implications). This three-way distinction cleanly maps every category to its analytical mode.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Four of the categories already have full configured-instance skills (/wt for goals, /foht for methods, /uaua for exploration, /araw for claims). The remaining 10 need thin routers — 
  short skills that classify the input's sub-type and invoke the right existing skill with the right mode. Skip /continue — it's handled by conversation context, not routing logic.
