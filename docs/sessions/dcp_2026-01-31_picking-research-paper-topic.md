# DCP — Picking a Research Paper Topic

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: picking a research paper topic

---

## Decision Type: "What should my research paper be about?"

This procedure applies any time you need to choose a topic for an academic research paper — undergraduate essays, graduate theses, conference submissions, or independent research.

---

## STEP 1: Decision Dimensions

What factors determine whether a research paper topic is the right choice?

| # | Dimension | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Personal Interest** | You will spend weeks or months on this. Low interest = abandoned papers, poor quality, and misery. |
| 2 | **Feasibility Within Constraints** | A brilliant topic you can't execute within your timeline, budget, or access limitations is worthless. |
| 3 | **Available Sources / Data** | A topic with no accessible evidence produces a paper with no substance. You need to verify sources exist before committing. |
| 4 | **Scope Fit** | Too broad = shallow survey nobody needs. Too narrow = not enough material. The scope must match the assignment length and depth. |
| 5 | **Novelty / Contribution** | Does this add something? Restating known conclusions wastes everyone's time. Even a small new angle, application, or synthesis counts. |
| 6 | **Audience Expectations** | A brilliant topic that doesn't match what the professor, journal, or conference wants will be rejected regardless of quality. |
| 7 | **Advisor / Evaluator Alignment** | Your advisor's expertise and interests determine the quality of feedback you'll get and how favorably the work is received. |
| 8 | **Methodological Match** | You need methods you can actually perform. A topic requiring skills you don't have (advanced statistics, lab access, foreign language sources) is a trap. |
| 9 | **Existing Literature Landscape** | Is the space over-saturated (hard to contribute) or barren (hard to ground your work)? The ideal is active-but-not-exhausted. |
| 10 | **Career / Portfolio Value** | Does this topic build toward something — a thesis, a job, a research program? Or is it a dead end? |
| 11 | **Ethical / IRB Constraints** | Topics involving human subjects, sensitive data, or controversial populations may require approvals that delay or block the project. |
| 12 | **Defensibility** | Can you defend your claims with evidence, or does the topic force you into speculation? Speculative topics are grading landmines. |

## STEP 2: Options Per Dimension

| Dimension | GREEN | YELLOW | RED |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----|
| Personal Interest | You'd read about this for fun | Mildly curious, could sustain effort | Bored by it, chose it because it seemed "safe" |
| Feasibility | Completable in 50% of available time | Tight but doable if nothing goes wrong | Requires more time/money/access than you have |
| Available Sources | 15+ quality sources found in 30 min of searching | 5-15 sources, some behind paywalls | Fewer than 5 sources, or only non-academic sources |
| Scope Fit | Clear thesis, 3-5 supporting sections obvious | Thesis possible but sections fuzzy | Can't articulate a thesis, or thesis needs a whole book |
| Novelty | Clear gap in literature you can fill | New application of existing framework | Pure summary of what others already said |
| Audience Expectations | Matches assignment/journal scope exactly | Tangentially related, could argue relevance | Outside the stated scope entirely |
| Advisor Alignment | Advisor has published on this exact area | Advisor knows the broader field | Advisor has no expertise here and can't guide you |
| Methodological Match | You've used these methods before | Methods are learnable in available time | Methods require training/tools you can't get |
| Literature Landscape | Active area, 5-10 recent papers, clear gaps | Either very active (saturated) or sparse | Dead field (no recent work) or so saturated every angle is taken |
| Career Value | Directly builds toward your next goal | Tangentially useful for your trajectory | No connection to anything you want to do next |
| Ethical Constraints | No approvals needed, public data only | IRB needed but straightforward | Sensitive populations, long approval process, may be denied |
| Defensibility | Multiple evidence types available | Evidence exists but is contested | Core claims would rest on opinion or speculation |

---

## STEP 3: Hidden Assumptions & Common Traps

| # | Assumption | Reality | Trap |
|---|-----------|---------|------|
| 1 | "I should pick the most interesting topic" | Interest is necessary but not sufficient. The most fascinating topic you can't execute is worse than a moderately interesting one you can. | People pick passion projects that are infeasible, then switch topics at the deadline. |
| 2 | "I'll find sources later" | Source availability is a hard constraint, not a soft one. If you can't find sources in 30 minutes of searching, you likely won't find them in 30 hours. | People commit to a topic, write an outline, then discover there's no evidence for their claims. |
| 3 | "A broader topic is easier" | Broader = harder. You need to survey more literature, make weaker claims, and compete with more existing work. Narrow topics are easier to execute well. | Students pick "The impact of social media on society" instead of "How Instagram Reels affect body image perception in college women aged 18-22." |
| 4 | "My advisor will help me narrow it down" | Advisors help refine topics, not choose them. If you show up with no direction, you'll get a topic that serves THEIR agenda, not yours. | You end up doing grunt work on your advisor's existing project instead of your own research. |
| 5 | "Novelty means a completely new idea" | At the undergrad/master's level, novelty usually means applying an existing framework to a new context, comparing two things not previously compared, or replicating a study in a different population. | People reject good topics because they feel "unoriginal," then struggle to find something truly new. |
| 6 | "I need to decide once and commit" | Topic selection is iterative. You pick a direction, do preliminary research, then refine or pivot. The first choice is a starting point, not a marriage. | People agonize for weeks over the "perfect" topic instead of starting with a good-enough one and iterating. |
| 7 | "Controversial topics get better grades" | Controversial topics are grading risks. They invite evaluator bias, require more rigorous evidence, and are harder to defend. Safe-but-well-executed beats provocative-but-shaky. | Students pick inflammatory topics thinking it shows boldness, then can't back up their claims. |
| 8 | "I should pick something nobody has written about" | If nobody has written about it, there's often a reason — lack of data, lack of significance, or the field has moved on. A topic with NO prior work is a red flag, not an opportunity. | People mistake an empty field for an open field. |

RESEARCH PAPER TOPIC SELECTION PROCEDURE
=========================================
Follow steps in order. Do not skip steps.

STEP 0: What is your situation?

│ Independent / self-directed research   │ SECTION B  │
│ (then skip to SECTION E)              │            │
└────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────┘
After completing your section, go to SECTION E.


SECTION A: Assigned Prompt or Topic List
────────────────────────────────────────
A1. Write down the exact assignment prompt or list of
    approved topics.
    ✓ You should see: the specific requirements in
      your own words

A2. For each option (or if open within a prompt,
    brainstorm 5-8 subtopics):
    → Write one sentence stating what your paper
      would ARGUE (not just describe)
    → Example: NOT "This paper is about climate change"
      BUT "This paper argues that carbon tax
      implementation in Nordic countries reduced
      emissions 15% more effectively than cap-and-trade
      systems in the same period"
    ✓ You should see: 5-8 one-sentence arguments

A3. For each argument from A2, spend exactly 10 minutes
    searching Google Scholar, your library database, or
    JSTOR:
    → Count how many relevant sources you find
    → Write the number next to each argument
    ✓ You should see: source counts next to each option

A4. Eliminate any option with fewer than 5 sources found
    in 10 minutes.
    → If ALL options have fewer than 5: broaden your
      search terms and repeat A3
    → If still all under 5: ask your professor for
      guidance (your prompt may be poorly designed)

A5. Go to SECTION E with your remaining options.


SECTION B: Open Topic Choice
─────────────────────────────
B1. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Write down every topic
    that interests you, even slightly. Do not filter.
    → Aim for at least 10 topics
    → Include topics from: classes you enjoyed, news
      you've read recently, arguments you've had,
      problems you've noticed, things you've Googled
      out of curiosity
    ✓ You should see: a messy list of 10+ topics

B2. For each topic, write a one-sentence ARGUMENT
    (not description):
    → Template: "I would argue that [specific claim]
      because [reason]"
    → If you can't write this sentence for a topic:
      cross it off. You don't have a paper there yet.
    ✓ You should see: topics with arguments, some
      crossed off

B3. Check scope. For each remaining topic, answer:
    → Can I cover this in [your page/word limit]?
    → If the answer requires "an overview of" or
      "a comprehensive look at" → TOO BROAD.
      Narrow it.
    → Narrowing method: Add constraints. Who? Where?
      When? Which aspect? Compared to what?
    → Example: "Effects of social media" →
      "How TikTok usage correlates with sleep quality
      in US college freshmen (2022-2024)"
    ✓ You should see: topics rewritten as specific,
      bounded claims

B4. Source check. For each remaining topic, spend
    10 minutes on Google Scholar:
    → Find relevant sources
    → Write the count
    → Eliminate anything under 5 sources
    ✓ You should see: source counts, some topics
      eliminated

B5. You should have 2-5 topics left. Go to SECTION E.


SECTION C: Thesis or Dissertation
──────────────────────────────────
C1. List your advisor's last 5 publications.
    → What themes appear?
    → What methods do they use?
    ✓ You should see: 2-3 recurring themes and
      1-2 methods

C2. List your own interests (same as B1).

C3. Find the OVERLAP between C1 and C2.
    → These are your candidate areas
    → If no overlap: you may have the wrong advisor,
      or you need to find a connection. Talk to your
      advisor before continuing.
    ✓ You should see: 2-4 areas where your interests
      and your advisor's expertise intersect

C4. For each overlap area, search the last 3 years of
    publications in your field's top journals:
    → What questions are people asking?
    → What do the "future work" sections suggest?
    → What contradictions exist between papers?
    ✓ You should see: specific gaps, contradictions,
      or suggested extensions

C5. For each gap/contradiction found:
    → Can you address it with methods you know (or
      can learn in one semester)?
    → Can you access the data/subjects/equipment
      needed?
    → Eliminate anything where both answers aren't yes
    ✓ You should see: 1-3 feasible research questions

C6. Draft a one-paragraph description of each surviving
    topic and bring it to your advisor. Do NOT ask
    "which should I pick?" Ask: "Which of these could
    I realistically complete, and which has the most
    publishable potential?"

C7. Go to SECTION E with your advisor's input.


SECTION D: Conference or Journal Submission
───────────────────────────────────────────
D1. Read the Call for Papers (CFP) or journal scope
    statement. Write down:
    → What topics are explicitly listed?
    → What methods are preferred?
    → What is the submission deadline?
    → What is the page/word limit?
    ✓ You should see: concrete constraints written out

D2. Count backward from the deadline:
    → Subtract 1 week for revision and formatting
    → Subtract 1 week for peer feedback
    → The remaining time is your actual working window
    → Is this enough time for original research, or
      only enough for analysis of existing data?
    ✓ You should see: realistic working time and what
      kind of paper that allows

D3. If time allows original research: follow SECTION C
    steps C4-C5, but filter for the CFP's topic list.
    If time only allows analysis: identify existing
    datasets, published studies to compare, or
    theoretical frameworks to apply to new contexts.

D4. Check: Has someone already published substantially
    the same paper?
    → Search exact phrases from your thesis statement
    → If yes: pivot to a different angle, population,
      time period, or method
    ✓ You should see: confirmation your angle is
      sufficiently distinct

D5. Go to SECTION E with your remaining options.


SECTION E: Final Selection (Everyone Does This)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
You should arrive here with 1-5 candidate topics, each
with a one-sentence argument and confirmed source
availability.

E1. Score each candidate. For each topic, answer these
    questions with YES (2 points), SOMEWHAT (1 point),
    or NO (0 points):

    □ Am I genuinely interested in this? (Interest)
    □ Can I finish this in the time I have? (Feasibility)
    □ Did I find 10+ quality sources? (Sources)
    □ Can I state a specific argument in one sentence?
      (Scope)
    □ Does this add something beyond summarizing others?
      (Novelty)
    □ Does this match what's expected of me? (Audience)
    □ Can my advisor/evaluator give useful feedback?
      (Alignment)
    □ Do I know how to do the research this requires?
      (Methods)
    □ Is there active recent work in this area?
      (Literature)
    □ Does this help my career/academic trajectory?
      (Career value)
    □ Are there ethical/IRB issues? Score YES if NO
      issues, NO if major issues. (Ethics)
    □ Can I defend my claims with hard evidence?
      (Defensibility)

    ✓ You should see: a score from 0-24 for each topic

E2. Interpret scores:
    → 20-24: Strong candidate. Proceed with confidence.
    → 15-19: Good candidate with some risks.
       Identify which dimensions scored low and decide
       if you can mitigate them.
    → 10-14: Risky. At least one critical dimension is
       weak. Proceed only if no better option exists AND
       you have a plan for the weak dimensions.
    → Below 10: Do not choose this topic. Return to
       your section and generate more options.

E3. If two topics score within 2 points of each other:
    → Pick the one with the higher Feasibility and
       Sources scores. These are hard constraints.
       Everything else can be improved during writing.

E4. Final gut check. Read your chosen topic's one-sentence
    argument aloud. Ask yourself:
    → "Do I want to spend [time estimate] on this?"
    → If your gut says no: honor that. Pick the next
      highest scorer.
    → If your gut says yes: proceed.

E5. Write your chosen topic as:
    → TOPIC: [title]
    → ARGUMENT: [one-sentence thesis]
    → SCOPE: [what's included and excluded]
    → METHOD: [how you'll support the argument]
    → SOURCES: [3-5 key sources already identified]

    ✓ This is your topic commitment document.

    → DONE.
```

## STEP 5: Failure Modes

| # | Failure | How to Recognize | What to Do |
|---|---------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Analysis paralysis** — scoring every topic repeatedly, never choosing | You've been on Section E for more than 1 hour, or you've re-scored topics 3+ times | Set a hard deadline: "I choose in the next 30 minutes." The difference between your top 2 options is smaller than you think. |
| 2 | **Passion trap** — chose for interest alone, ignored feasibility | You scored 2/2 on Interest but 0/2 on Feasibility and Sources | Go back to E1. If Feasibility + Sources < 3 combined, this topic will hurt you regardless of interest. |
| 3 | **Advisor appeasement** — chose your advisor's suggestion even though you hate it | You scored 0 on Interest but are proceeding because "they know best" | Negotiate. Propose a version of their suggestion that overlaps with your interests. If impossible, consider switching advisors (for thesis) or accepting reduced enthusiasm (for a single paper). |
| 4 | **Scope creep after selection** — the topic grows as you research | Your outline has 15+ sections, or you keep saying "I also need to cover..." | Re-read your E5 commitment document. If new material is outside your stated SCOPE, it's out. Period. |
| 5 | **Source mirage** — the 10 sources you found don't actually support your argument | You found sources about the topic area, but none address your specific argument | Go back to A2/B2. Rewrite your argument to match what the sources actually say, or find sources that match your argument. Don't force a mismatch. |
| 6 | **Novelty anxiety** — you reject every topic as "too obvious" | You've eliminated every option because "someone must have already done this" | At the course paper level, novelty means a new angle or application, not a new discovery. If your exact thesis sentence doesn't appear in existing papers, you have enough novelty. |
| 7 | **Late pivot** — you discover a problem 2 weeks in and start over | Fundamental issue appears during writing (no data, contradicted by evidence, too broad) | This is why the procedure front-loads source checking and scope definition. If you followed E1-E5 honestly, pivots should be minor adjustments, not restarts. |
| 8 | **Committee mismatch** — topic doesn't fit any committee member's expertise (thesis) | Committee members give vague or unhelpful feedback on your proposal | Before finalizing (between C6 and E1), verify that at least 2 committee members can meaningfully evaluate your methodology. |

---

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

```
THE 5-MINUTE VERSION:
  1. Brainstorm 10+ topics (15 min)
  2. Write a one-sentence ARGUMENT for each
  3. Cross off any you can't write an argument for
  4. Spend 10 min searching sources for each survivor
  5. Cross off any with fewer than 5 sources
  6. Score remaining topics on 12 dimensions (0-24 scale)
  7. Pick the highest scorer
  8. If tied: pick the one with better Feasibility + Sources
  9. Write your commitment document (E5)
```

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. Picking a description ("about climate change") instead of an argument ("carbon taxes reduce emissions more than cap-and-trade in Nordic countries")
2. Committing to a topic before checking that sources exist
3. Choosing the broadest possible topic because it "gives more to write about"
4. Rejecting all topics as "not original enough" at the course paper level
5. Ignoring methodological constraints — choosing a topic that requires skills you don't have
6. Letting your advisor choose for you entirely, then having no motivation
7. Spending more time choosing than writing
8. Not narrowing by adding constraints (who, where, when, which aspect, compared to what)

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **You already have a topic you're excited about and your advisor approved it**: Skip to E1, score it as a sanity check, then proceed if it scores 15+.
- **Your assignment gives you zero choice**: There is no decision to make. Follow the prompt.
- **You're an expert in the field**: Steps B1-B4 are for people who need help generating options. If you already have deep domain knowledge, start at Section C or D.
- **Deadline is tomorrow**: Skip everything. Pick the topic with the most sources you can find in 10 minutes. Write the best paper you can. This procedure is for when you have time to choose well.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Undergraduate Course Paper (open topic, 10 pages)

**Step 0**: Open topic → SECTION B

**B1**: Topics brainstormed: remote work productivity, TikTok and political opinions, sleep deprivation in students, fast fashion, cryptocurrency regulation, AI in hiring, urban gardening, vaccine hesitancy, music therapy, student debt

**B2**: Arguments written:
- "Remote workers are more productive than office workers when given autonomy over their schedule" ✓
- "TikTok's algorithm creates political echo chambers stronger than Facebook's" ✓
- "Sleep deprivation costs US universities more in academic failure than alcohol does" ✓
- (7 others)

**B3**: Scope narrowing:
- Remote work → "Remote software developers with 2+ years experience, 2020-2024, measuring output quality not just hours"
- TikTok → "How TikTok's For You algorithm affects political knowledge accuracy in US college students, 2023-2024"

**B4**: Source check (10 min each on Google Scholar):
- Remote work: 23 sources → ✓
- TikTok politics: 8 sources → ✓
- Sleep deprivation: 31 sources → ✓
- (3 others eliminated, under 5 sources)

**E1**: Scoring (top 3 shown):

| Dimension | Remote Work | TikTok | Sleep |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| Interest | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Feasibility | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Sources | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Scope | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Novelty | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Audience | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Alignment | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Methods | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Literature | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Career | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Ethics | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Defensibility | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **21** | **20** | **18** |

**E2**: Remote work (21) and TikTok (20) are within 2 points.

**E3**: Tiebreaker — Feasibility + Sources: Remote work (4), TikTok (3). **Pick remote work.**

**E5**:
- TOPIC: Remote Software Developer Productivity and Schedule Autonomy
- ARGUMENT: Remote software developers produce higher-quality code when given full autonomy over their daily schedule, based on 2020-2024 studies
- SCOPE: Software developers only, quality metrics (not hours), post-pandemic data
- METHOD: Literature review comparing controlled studies
- SOURCES: [3 key papers identified]

### Example 2: Graduate Thesis (advisor in behavioral economics)

**C1**: Advisor's recent publications: nudge theory in healthcare, default options in retirement savings, framing effects in consumer choice. Methods: randomized controlled trials, survey experiments.

**C2**: Student interests: environmental policy, behavioral change, consumer psychology.

**C3**: Overlap: behavioral nudges applied to environmental behavior (e.g., default green energy options, framing recycling choices).

**C4**: Literature search reveals: many studies on green defaults in energy, fewer on framing effects in water conservation. "Future work" sections mention: applying nudge theory to water usage in drought-prone regions.

**C5**: Feasibility check: student can design a survey experiment (known method), can access university participant pool (no special equipment), no IRB issues beyond standard survey approval.

**C6**: Takes to advisor: "Framing effects on household water conservation intentions in drought-prone California communities — would this be feasible and publishable?" Advisor says yes, suggests adding a comparison between gain-framing and loss-framing.

**E1**: Scores 22/24 (Career value = 1 because student wants to go into tech, not academia; otherwise strong across the board). Proceeds.

---

**Validation status**: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts. It synthesizes common academic advising practices into a mechanical format. Should be tested across disciplines — STEM topics may weight methodology and data access higher, humanities topics may weight novelty and argument quality higher.
