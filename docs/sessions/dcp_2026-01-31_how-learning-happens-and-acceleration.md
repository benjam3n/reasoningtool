## Step 1: Discover Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

The recurring decision: **"Given what I need to learn, what is the fastest path to functional competence?"**

### Dimensions that determine the right learning approach:

1. **Knowledge Type** — Is this declarative (facts/concepts), procedural (how-to), perceptual (pattern recognition), or motor (physical skill)? Each type has a fundamentally different acquisition mechanism.

2. **Current Level** — Where are you now? Complete novice, have adjacent expertise, intermediate with gaps, or advanced seeking mastery? The optimal strategy differs radically at each level.

3. **Feedback Availability** — Can you get clear, fast, accurate feedback on whether you're doing it right? Some domains give instant feedback (programming compiles or doesn't), others are delayed or noisy (management decisions take months to evaluate).

4. **Decomposability** — Can the skill be broken into independent sub-skills you can practice separately? Playing chess decomposes (openings, endgames, tactics). "Being charismatic" resists decomposition.

5. **Transfer Distance** — How far is this from things you already know? Learning Spanish when you know French (near transfer) vs. learning Mandarin from only English (far transfer).

6. **Error Tolerance** — What's the cost of doing it wrong while learning? Surgery has zero error tolerance. Writing has high error tolerance. This determines whether you can learn by doing or must learn by simulation first.

7. **Encoding Modality** — Does this knowledge live in words, images, body memory, spatial relationships, or social intuition? Mismatching the study method to the modality wastes time.

8. **Retention Requirement** — Do you need this for a one-time event (an exam, a presentation), ongoing use (a job skill), or permanent fluency (a language)? The investment profile changes completely.

9. **Complexity Gradient** — Is there a natural progression from simple to complex, or does the domain hit you with full complexity from day one? Math has a clear gradient. Entrepreneurship doesn't.

10. **Social Component** — Does learning require interaction with others (negotiation, teaching, leadership), or can it be done alone (programming, writing, math)?

11. **Motivation Structure** — Is motivation intrinsic (you find it fascinating), extrinsic (you need it for a goal), or aversive (you're avoiding consequences)? This determines which study methods you'll actually sustain.

12. **Available Time Structure** — Do you have concentrated blocks (sabbatical, bootcamp) or scattered fragments (30 min/day between other obligations)?

## Step 2: Enumerate Options per Dimension (`/se`)

| Dimension | Possible States |
|---|---|
| **Knowledge Type** | Declarative / Procedural / Perceptual / Motor / Hybrid (most real skills) |
| **Current Level** | Zero (never encountered) / Novice (basic awareness) / Intermediate (can do with effort) / Advanced (seeking refinement) |
| **Feedback Availability** | Instant & clear / Delayed but clear / Instant but ambiguous / Delayed & ambiguous / No feedback available |
| **Decomposability** | Fully decomposable / Partially decomposable / Holistic (can't meaningfully separate parts) |
| **Transfer Distance** | Near (similar domain known) / Medium (adjacent domain) / Far (nothing similar known) / Negative transfer (existing knowledge interferes) |
| **Error Tolerance** | High (mistakes are cheap) / Medium (mistakes cost time/money) / Low (mistakes are dangerous or irreversible) |
| **Encoding Modality** | Verbal-conceptual / Visual-spatial / Kinesthetic / Social-relational / Multi-modal |
| **Retention Requirement** | One-time use / Periodic use / Daily use / Permanent fluency |
| **Complexity Gradient** | Clear simple→complex path / Moderate ordering possible / No natural ordering / Must face full complexity immediately |
| **Social Component** | Solo-learnable / Benefits from partner / Requires group / Requires live interaction with stakeholders |
| **Motivation Structure** | Intrinsic fascination / Goal-driven extrinsic / Avoidance-driven / No motivation (forced) |
| **Available Time** | Immersive blocks (4+ hrs/day) / Moderate blocks (1-3 hrs/day) / Fragments (< 1 hr/day) / Irregular/unpredictable |

**Key interactions**:
- If Feedback Availability = none AND Error Tolerance = low → you MUST find a mentor or simulator before practicing
- If Knowledge Type = procedural AND you study only declaratively → you will feel like you're learning but can't perform (the "read about swimming" trap)
- If Motivation Structure = no motivation AND Available Time = fragments → dropout rate approaches 100%; address motivation first
- If Transfer Distance = negative → unlearning phase required before new learning begins

## Step 3: Surface Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

What does conventional learning advice assume that's often wrong?

1. **"Understanding precedes doing"** — The standard model says: read → understand → practice. Research on procedural learning shows the opposite is often faster: attempt → fail → understand why → attempt again. Understanding that arrives *after* an attempt sticks because it has something to attach to.

2. **"More study time = more learning"** — After about 45-90 minutes of focused study on a single topic, retention drops sharply. Two 45-minute sessions with sleep between them outperform one 3-hour session. People who "study all day" are mostly doing forgetting-and-re-encoding loops.

3. **"Difficulty means you're doing it wrong"** — Desirable difficulty (Bjork) shows that conditions that *slow* learning during practice (interleaving, spacing, generation) *accelerate* long-term retention. Feeling confused is often a signal of effective learning, not ineffective teaching.

4. **"Learn the fundamentals first, then apply"** — For many domains, learning in context (project-based, case-based) is faster than learning fundamentals in isolation. Fundamentals make sense retroactively after you've seen why they matter.

5. **"You need to be comprehensive"** — The Pareto principle applies aggressively to learning. In most domains, 20% of the concepts account for 80% of practical competence. Most learners waste time on completionism.

6. **"Talent determines speed"** — Prior knowledge and study strategy explain far more variance in learning speed than innate ability. Someone with the right adjacent knowledge and an effective strategy will outlearn a "talented" person using a poor strategy.

7. **"Passive review works"** — Re-reading, re-watching, and highlighting produce almost no durable learning. Active recall (testing yourself) is 2-3x more effective per minute spent. But passive methods *feel* productive because recognition is easy and misleads you into thinking you know the material.

8. **"Learning is monotonically increasing"** — Learning follows a staircase pattern with plateaus. Plateaus feel like failure but are often consolidation periods. Quitting during a plateau is the #1 cause of learning failure.

## Step 4: The Procedure (`/stg`)

```
LEARNING ACCELERATION PROCEDURE
=================================

WHO THIS IS FOR: Anyone who needs to learn something and wants
to do it in the least time possible without sacrificing retention.

YOU WILL NEED:
- A clear description of what you're trying to learn
- Knowledge of how much time you have available
- Willingness to feel uncomfortable (effective learning feels harder)
```

### STEP 0: What are you trying to learn?

Write one sentence: "I need to be able to ___."

Not "I want to learn about X" — that's a topic, not a capability. Rewrite until it describes something you can *do*.

| Your capability looks like... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Knowing facts/concepts to use in reasoning or conversation | SECTION A (Declarative) |
| Performing a procedure or process | SECTION B (Procedural) |
| Recognizing patterns (reading X-rays, tasting wine, debugging code) | SECTION C (Perceptual) |
| A physical skill (instrument, sport, surgery) | SECTION D (Motor) |
| Multiple types combined | Start with the type you're weakest in |

---

### SECTION A: Learning Facts and Concepts (Declarative Knowledge)

**Step A1: Find the 20% that matters.**
- Ask someone who uses this knowledge daily: "What are the 10 most important concepts a beginner needs?"
- If no expert is available: scan a textbook's table of contents. Star the chapters referenced by later chapters — those are the load-bearing concepts.
- Write down the list. This is your **core curriculum**.
- **What you should see**: 5-15 concepts, not 50.

**Step A2: For each core concept, create a question-answer pair.**
- The question should require *recall*, not recognition.
- BAD: "What are the three types of X? (a) A, B, C (b) D, E, F" ← this is recognition
- GOOD: "Name the three types of X and explain when each applies." ← this is recall
- **What you should see**: A stack of flashcards (physical or digital, e.g., Anki).

**Step A3: Study using spaced retrieval.**
- Day 1: Attempt all cards. Mark which ones you got wrong.
- Day 2: Attempt only the wrong ones, plus re-attempt 30% of the right ones.
- Day 4: Attempt all cards again.
- Day 7: Attempt all cards again.
- After Day 7: Review once per week for cards you get right, once per day for cards you get wrong.
- **What you should see**: The number of "wrong" cards shrinking each session.

**Step A4: Connect concepts to each other.**
- After you can recall each concept individually, draw a map showing how they relate.
- For each pair of concepts, ask: "How does A affect B?" If you can't answer, study that relationship.
- **What you should see**: A web of relationships, not a list of isolated facts.

**Step A5: Test with application.**
- Find a real problem that requires using this knowledge.
- Attempt to solve it using only what you've learned (no references).
- Note where you get stuck. Those gaps are your next study targets.
- **Exit criterion**: You can solve novel problems using the knowledge without looking anything up.

→ If done, go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION B: Learning Procedures (Procedural Knowledge)

**Step B1: Get a complete worked example.**
- Find someone doing the thing you need to learn and watch/read the ENTIRE process, start to finish.
- If no example exists: find a tutorial, walkthrough, or case study.
- DO NOT try to understand everything yet. Just observe the full sequence.
- **What you should see**: A recorded or written sequence of steps from start to finish.

**Step B2: Identify the sub-procedures.**
- Break the full procedure into chunks of 3-7 steps each.
- Label each chunk: "Setting up," "The core operation," "Handling exceptions," etc.
- **What you should see**: 3-8 labeled chunks that together make up the whole procedure.

**Step B3: Practice the easiest chunk first — in isolation.**
- Pick the chunk with the fewest dependencies on other chunks.
- Do it 3 times. On each attempt, try to do more from memory and less from reference.
- **What you should see**: By attempt 3, you can do this chunk with only occasional reference checks.

**Step B4: Add chunks one at a time.**
- Practice chunk 1 + chunk 2 together. Then 1 + 2 + 3.
- Each time you add a chunk, do the full sequence from the beginning.
- This feels inefficient (you keep redoing early chunks). It's not — the repetition builds automaticity.
- **What you should see**: Earlier chunks becoming effortless as you focus on newer ones.

**Step B5: Practice with variation.**
- Once you can do the full procedure, change the inputs. Use different starting conditions.
- Deliberately introduce common problems and practice recovering.
- **What you should see**: The procedure working even when conditions aren't ideal.

**Step B6: Practice without a safety net.**
- Do the full procedure in a realistic context without any reference material.
- Note where you hesitate or make errors. Those are your remaining gaps.
- **Exit criterion**: You can perform the full procedure in realistic conditions with acceptable error rate.

→ If done, go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION C: Learning Pattern Recognition (Perceptual Knowledge)

**Step C1: Collect labeled examples.**
- You need examples where you KNOW the right answer (diagnosed X-rays, classified bugs, categorized cases).
- Minimum: 20 examples per category you need to distinguish.
- **What you should see**: A library of examples with verified labels.

**Step C2: Start with extreme cases.**
- Find the most obvious example of each category — the textbook case.
- Study these until you can identify them instantly.
- **What you should see**: "That's obviously an X" confidence on clear-cut cases.

**Step C3: Introduce harder cases.**
- Now look at cases that are close to the boundary between categories.
- For each, ask: "What feature distinguishes this from [the similar category]?"
- Write down the distinguishing features. These are your **diagnostic cues**.
- **What you should see**: A list of 3-7 cues per category that distinguish it from similar categories.

**Step C4: Practice classification with feedback.**
- Look at unlabeled examples. Classify them. Then check the answer.
- CRITICAL: when you're wrong, don't just note "I was wrong." Ask: "What cue did I miss? What cue misled me?"
- **What you should see**: Your error rate dropping from session to session.

**Step C5: Increase speed.**
- Once accuracy is high (>85%), reduce the time you spend on each classification.
- Expert pattern recognition is fast — if you're slow but accurate, you're reasoning, not recognizing. Speed training converts reasoning into recognition.
- **Exit criterion**: You can classify novel examples accurately within the time frame required by your context.

→ If done, go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION D: Learning Physical Skills (Motor Knowledge)

**Step D1: Watch expert performance in slow motion.**
- Video of an expert doing the skill. Watch it at 0.5x speed, multiple times.
- Focus on a different body part or movement each viewing.
- **What you should see**: You can describe the sequence of movements verbally.

**Step D2: Isolate the hardest sub-movement.**
- Which part of the physical skill is the most technically demanding?
- Practice ONLY that part, at reduced speed or reduced intensity.
- Do 10-20 repetitions per practice session. More than that, fatigue degrades form.
- **What you should see**: The sub-movement becoming smoother (less jerky, less effortful).

**Step D3: Chain movements together.**
- Once the isolated sub-movement is passable, connect it to the movements before and after.
- Practice the 3-movement sequence. Then expand.
- **What you should see**: Transitions between movements becoming seamless.

**Step D4: Add speed/intensity gradually.**
- Increase speed by 10% increments. At each increment, check if form degrades.
- If form breaks down, drop back one increment and practice more at that level.
- **What you should see**: Same quality of movement at progressively higher speed.

**Step D5: Practice under realistic conditions.**
- Add the distractions, fatigue, and pressure of real performance conditions.
- Motor skills that only work in quiet practice rooms don't transfer.
- **Exit criterion**: You can perform the skill at target speed under realistic conditions.

→ If done, go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### COMPLETION CHECK

Answer these three questions:

1. **Can you do the thing you wrote in Step 0 — right now, without preparation?**
   - YES → You've learned it. Move to RETENTION PLAN.
   - NO → Identify what's missing. Return to the relevant section.

2. **Can you do it when conditions are slightly different from how you practiced?**
   - YES → Your learning has generalized. Move to RETENTION PLAN.
   - NO → You've memorized, not learned. Go back and practice with more variation (Steps A5, B5, C4, D5).

3. **Can you explain to someone else how to do it?**
   - YES → Deep encoding achieved.
   - NO → This is fine for procedural/motor/perceptual skills. For declarative knowledge, this gap means your understanding is shallow — go back to Step A4.

---

### RETENTION PLAN

| Your retention need | Do this |
|---|---|
| One-time use (exam, presentation) | Intensive practice in the 48 hours before. No long-term plan needed. |
| Periodic use (quarterly skill) | Review/practice for 20 minutes on the day before you need it. Keep your notes accessible. |
| Ongoing use (job skill) | Use it regularly. If gaps appear, do a targeted review of the weak area. |
| Permanent fluency (language, instrument) | Schedule practice 3x/week minimum. Missing more than 2 weeks triggers skill decay. |

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The Learning Accelerator Hierarchy

The interventions below are ordered from highest to lowest impact per hour invested:

1. **Test yourself instead of re-reading** (2-3x more effective per minute)
2. **Space your practice** (same total time, spread over days = 2x better retention)
3. **Interleave topics** (mix different types of problems in one session)
4. **Sleep between sessions** (consolidation happens during sleep, not during study)
5. **Eliminate the 80% that doesn't matter** (study less, but study the right things)
6. **Get immediate feedback** (every minute of practice without feedback risks encoding errors)

### Card 2: Why You Feel Like You're Not Learning

| What you're experiencing | What's actually happening |
|---|---|
| "I keep forgetting" | Normal. Forgetting and re-learning is HOW memory strengthens. |
| "I'm stuck at the same level" | Plateau. Consolidation phase. Change your practice method slightly. |
| "It feels too hard" | Desirable difficulty. This is the feeling of effective learning. |
| "I understood it yesterday, can't do it today" | Sleep reconsolidation. Try again — it'll come back faster than before. |
| "Others learn this faster than me" | They probably have more prior knowledge in adjacent areas, not more talent. |

### Card 3: The Anti-Patterns

| What people do | Why it's slow | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Read the whole textbook | Passive intake, no encoding | Read one chapter, test yourself, then read the next |
| Watch tutorial after tutorial | Creates illusion of learning | Watch one, then DO it without the tutorial |
| Practice only what they're good at | No challenge = no growth | Practice the thing you're worst at |
| Study for 4 hours straight | Diminishing returns after ~1 hour | Two 1-hour sessions with a break/sleep between |
| Highlight and re-read notes | Recognition ≠ recall | Cover the page, write from memory, check |

---

## Step 5: Anticipate Failures (`/fla`)

### Failure Mode 1: "I classified my knowledge type wrong"
**When it happens**: User thinks they need declarative knowledge ("understand machine learning") but actually need procedural knowledge ("build a model that works").
**How to recognize**: You're making flashcards for something you should be doing hands-on.
**Override**: If at any point the thing you wrote in Step 0 is a *verb* (build, perform, diagnose, negotiate), you need Section B, C, or D — not Section A. Reclassify.

### Failure Mode 2: "I'm doing the right method but the wrong content"
**When it happens**: Step A1's "find the 20%" goes wrong because the expert you asked has different goals than you, or no expert is available and you guessed wrong about what's load-bearing.
**How to recognize**: You're learning material that doesn't help you solve real problems (Step A5 reveals large gaps despite good flashcard performance).
**Override**: Find a second expert with a different perspective. Or skip to Step A5 first — attempt the real problem immediately, and let your failures reveal what you actually need to learn.

### Failure Mode 3: "I quit during the plateau"
**When it happens**: After initial rapid improvement, progress stalls. Learner interprets this as "I've hit my ceiling" and stops.
**How to recognize**: You've been at the same level for 1-3 weeks and are losing motivation.
**Override**: Plateaus are not ceilings. Change ONE variable: study method, practice type, or difficulty level. If you've been doing isolated practice, try integrated practice. If you've been studying alone, find a practice partner. The plateau usually breaks within a week of changing approach.

### Failure Mode 4: "I'm studying effectively but not sleeping enough"
**When it happens**: Learner uses all the right techniques but short-changes sleep, negating most of the benefit.
**How to recognize**: Material learned in the evening is gone by morning. Recall feels "foggy."
**Override**: Sleep is not optional infrastructure — it's the primary mechanism of memory consolidation. One hour of sleep is worth more than one hour of additional study. Non-negotiable minimum: 7 hours on nights between study sessions.

### Failure Mode 5: "I have negative transfer from existing expertise"
**When it happens**: Something you already know interferes with what you're learning. A Java programmer learning Python keeps writing Java-style Python. A tennis player learning badminton uses the wrong wrist mechanics.
**How to recognize**: You keep making the SAME error and it feels "natural" to do it wrong.
**Override**: You need an explicit unlearning phase. Name the old pattern ("In Java, I do X"). Name the new pattern ("In Python, I do Y"). Every time you catch yourself doing X, stop, say "that's the old way," and deliberately do Y. This takes 2-3x longer than learning from scratch because you're fighting an established habit.

---

## Step 6: Validate Executability (`/pv`)

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Every step is a concrete action (write, find, practice, attempt) — not "consider" or "reflect" | PASS |
| All decision points are binary or explicit multiple choice | PASS |
| No jargon without inline definition | PASS — "desirable difficulty," "interleaving," "spaced retrieval" all defined in context |
| Every path terminates (no dead ends or infinite loops) | PASS — Completion Check provides exit criteria; plateau failure mode prevents infinite loops |
| Someone with no expertise in learning science could follow this | PASS |
| Steps reference observable outputs ("what you should see" at each step) | PASS |
| Exit criteria are measurable | PASS — "can you do X right now without preparation" is observable |

**Issue found and fixed**: Section C (Perceptual Knowledge) requires "20 labeled examples per category" which may be hard to obtain. This is a real constraint, not a procedure flaw — the difficulty of obtaining labeled examples is why perceptual skills are slow to learn. No change needed, but the requirement stands as a genuine bottleneck the user should address before starting.

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Studying the subject instead of practicing the skill.** Reading a book about negotiation is not learning to negotiate. If your Step 0 is a verb, your study sessions must contain that verb.

2. **Optimizing the plan instead of executing it.** Spending a week choosing the "perfect" textbook or the "best" Anki settings. Pick one reasonable option and start. You can adjust after your first week.

3. **Treating all learning as Section A.** Schools train people to think learning = reading + memorizing. For most real-world skills, Section B or C is what you actually need.

4. **Ignoring the feedback loop.** Practice without feedback is just repetition. You get really good at doing it wrong. Always know how to check whether you did it right.

5. **Comparing your rate of progress to others.** Learning speed depends heavily on prior knowledge, which is invisible. Someone who learns "faster" usually has more relevant background, not more ability.

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **When you have a dedicated teacher/mentor**: A good mentor adapts the curriculum in real-time, which is more effective than any static procedure. Use this procedure when learning alone.
- **When you're learning for pleasure, not performance**: If you're learning guitar for fun, optimizing for speed may kill the enjoyment. Efficiency matters when there's a goal with a deadline.
- **When the domain is changing rapidly**: In fast-moving fields (AI, crypto, emerging markets), the content you need to learn is shifting faster than you can learn it. Prioritize "learning to learn" and "knowing where to look" over deep retention.
- **When learning requires immersion**: Some domains (language, culture, artistic style) are better absorbed through immersion than through structured practice. If after 2 weeks of this procedure you feel like you're "learning about" the domain but not "becoming fluent in" it, switch to immersion.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Software Engineer Learning Kubernetes

**Step 0**: "I need to be able to deploy and manage containerized applications on Kubernetes."
→ This is procedural. **Section B**.

- B1: Follows a complete Kubernetes deployment tutorial, start to finish, deploying a sample app.
- B2: Identifies chunks: writing Dockerfiles → creating manifests → deploying to a cluster → configuring networking → monitoring → troubleshooting.
- B3: Starts with "writing Dockerfiles" (fewest dependencies). Practices containerizing 3 different apps.
- B4: Chains Dockerfile → manifest → deploy. Does the full sequence 3 times.
- B5: Varies inputs: different app types, different cluster configurations, intentionally breaks things to practice troubleshooting.
- B6: Takes a new app they've never seen and deploys it to a fresh cluster without reference material.

**Completion Check**: Can deploy a novel app? Yes. Different conditions? Tested with variations. Can explain? Yes.
**Time saved vs. "read the docs end to end"**: Functional in ~40% of the time because they skipped the 80% of Kubernetes they don't need for their use case.

### Example 2: Medical Student Learning ECG Interpretation

**Step 0**: "I need to be able to identify common cardiac arrhythmias from 12-lead ECGs."
→ This is perceptual. **Section C**.

- C1: Collects a library of labeled ECGs — normal sinus, AFib, AFlutter, VTach, VFib, heart blocks (20+ of each from textbooks and online databases).
- C2: Studies the "textbook perfect" example of each: the unmistakable AFib, the classic VTach.
- C3: Introduces ambiguous cases: is this rapid AFib or SVT? What cue distinguishes them? (Irregularly irregular vs. regular.) Documents diagnostic cues for each arrhythmia.
- C4: Uses an ECG quiz app. After each guess, checks the answer. When wrong, identifies the missed cue.
- C5: After reaching 90% accuracy, starts doing timed classification — 30 seconds per ECG.

**Completion Check**: Can identify arrhythmias in novel ECGs? Yes. Under time pressure? Yes.
**Why this beats "memorize the textbook chapter"**: Pattern recognition requires SEEING patterns, not reading descriptions of patterns. 100 labeled examples teach more than 1000 words.

### Example 3: Manager Learning to Give Difficult Feedback

**Step 0**: "I need to be able to deliver critical feedback to direct reports in a way that's clear, specific, and doesn't destroy the relationship."
→ This is procedural + social. **Section B** with social component.

- B1: Watches 3 videos of well-executed feedback conversations (training videos, not theory lectures). Notes the structure: opening, evidence, impact, request, check-in.
- B2: Chunks: opening (set context without triggering defensiveness) → stating the issue (specific behavior, not character) → explaining impact → making a request → checking understanding.
- B3: Practices the opening alone — writes out 5 different openings for 5 different scenarios. Says them out loud.
- B4: Chains opening → issue → impact. Role-plays with a peer or coach.
- B5: Varies: practices with different severity levels (minor habit vs. serious performance issue), different personality types (defensive, emotional, dismissive).
- B6: Delivers real feedback in a real 1:1.

**Completion Check**: Can deliver feedback on a novel issue? Tested in Step B6. Different conditions? Practiced variation in B5.
**Override**: This is a domain where a mentor (executive coach) adds enormous value. Use the procedure to structure self-practice between coaching sessions.
