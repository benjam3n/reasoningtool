  1. [NOVEL] The improvement pipeline has failure modes at each stage - Need cascading safeguards                                                                                       
  2. [NOVEL] Improvement criteria themselves need improvement - Meta-meta problem

    - Answer: Bootstrap from grounded criteria, then iterate                                                                                                                            
  3. [NOVEL] The validation test suite is itself a form of criteria - Tests encode quality expectations                                                                                 
  4. [NOVEL] Human oversight can be minimal but must exist - "Zero human" is dangerous; "minimal human" is achievable                                                                   
  5. [NOVEL] Emergence detection is more valuable than improvement automation - Finding new dimensions matters more than optimizing known ones

  1. [NOVEL] Autonomy is a spectrum, not a binary - Current state → Semi → Supervised → Autonomous with oversight                                                                       
  2. [NOVEL] The improvement pipeline has the same structure as GOSM itself - Map space (learning) → Test (validation) → Synthesize (improvement) → Verify (monitoring)                 
  3. [NOVEL] Emergence detection is more valuable than improvement automation - Finding new dimensions > optimizing known ones                                                          
  4. [NOVEL] Criteria themselves need improvement mechanisms - The system should improve its improvement criteria                                                                       
  5. [NOVEL] Minimal human ≠ zero human - The goal is not full autonomy but appropriate autonomy                                                                                        
  6. [NOVEL] Failure cases are the best test cases - What broke before must not break again

  This session designed the architecture for GOSM to become self-improving. The path is clear: outcome tracking → pattern extraction → test suite → proposals → validation → deployment.
