# Decision Procedure — Finding the Right Question

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: finding the right question

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

What factors determine whether you've found the right question?

| # | Dimension | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Current State** | What situation triggered the need for a question? (stuck, curious, starting something, failing, succeeding but unsatisfied) | The right question depends entirely on what you're actually facing — not what you think you're facing |
| 2 | **Question Level** | Are you asking at the operational level (how to do X), strategic level (should I do X), or foundational level (what is X really about)? | Most people ask operational questions when they need strategic ones, and strategic questions when they need foundational ones |
| 3 | **Assumed Answer** | What answer are you already expecting? | If you already know the answer you want, you haven't found a question — you've found a confirmation request. The right question has an uncertain answer |
| 4 | **Stakeholder Scope** | Whose problem is this? Just yours, your team's, your organization's, your field's, humanity's? | Scope determines whether the question is personal or systemic, and whether you need a local or universal answer |
| 5 | **Constraint Awareness** | What constraints are you taking as given that might actually be changeable? | The right question often lives behind a constraint everyone assumes is fixed |
| 6 | **Time Horizon** | Does the answer need to work for the next hour, week, year, decade? | Short-horizon questions are about tactics; long-horizon questions are about direction. Mismatched horizons produce wrong questions |
| 7 | **Information State** | What do you already know, what don't you know, and what don't you know you don't know? | If you have full information, you don't need a question — you need a decision. If you're missing info, the right question gets you the right info |
| 8 | **Emotional Substrate** | What feeling is driving the need for a question? (anxiety, frustration, curiosity, ambition, boredom, fear) | Emotions point at real needs but often misdirect the framing. Anxiety asks "how do I not fail?" when the right question might be "what's worth attempting?" |
| 9 | **Question History** | What questions have you already asked about this? What did the answers reveal? | If previous questions led nowhere, the problem isn't the answers — it's the questions. Pattern in failed questions reveals the framing error |
| 10 | **Actionability** | Can the answer to this question change what you do? | A question whose answer doesn't change your behavior is entertainment, not inquiry. The right question has action implications |
| 11 | **Decomposability** | Is this one question or several questions pretending to be one? | "How do I fix my life?" is 15 questions. The right question is specific enough to have a specific answer |
| 12 | **Falsifiability** | Can you tell the difference between a good answer and a bad one? | If any answer sounds equally plausible, the question is too vague. The right question lets you distinguish signal from noise |

---

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

### Current State Options

| State | Common Wrong Question | Right Question Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Stuck** | "How do I get unstuck?" | "What am I actually trying to accomplish, and is stuck-ness a sign I'm on the wrong path?" |
| **Curious** | "What's the answer to X?" | "Why does X interest me? What would change if I knew?" |
| **Starting something** | "How do I begin?" | "What does done look like? What's the first thing I could test?" |
| **Failing** | "How do I stop failing?" | "What is the failure telling me? Is the goal right?" |
| **Succeeding but unsatisfied** | "How do I do more of this?" | "What am I optimizing that I don't actually value?" |
| **Overwhelmed** | "How do I handle all of this?" | "Which of these things actually matters? What can I drop?" |
| **In conflict** | "How do I win this argument?" | "What does the other side know that I don't?" |

### Question Level Options

| Level | Characteristics | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Operational** | How to execute a known plan | "How do I format this spreadsheet?" |
| **Tactical** | Which approach to use for a known goal | "Should I use tool A or tool B?" |
| **Strategic** | Whether the goal itself is correct | "Am I solving the right problem?" |
| **Foundational** | Whether the entire frame is correct | "What is this situation actually about?" |

**Key pattern**: People default one level too low. If you think you need a tactical question, you probably need a strategic one.

### Question Types by Function

| Type | What It Does | Template |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagnostic** | Finds the actual problem | "What is really going on here?" |
| **Generative** | Opens new possibilities | "What haven't I considered?" |
| **Evaluative** | Distinguishes better from worse | "How would I know if this is working?" |
| **Causal** | Finds root mechanisms | "What's causing X, and what's causing that?" |
| **Comparative** | Reveals relative value | "Compared to what?" |
| **Constraint-revealing** | Surfaces hidden limits | "What am I assuming can't change?" |
| **Inverting** | Flips the problem | "What would I do if the opposite were true?" |
| **Simplifying** | Cuts to the core | "What's the simplest version of this problem?" |

### Key Interactions

- If **Current State = stuck** AND **Question History = many failed questions**, then you need a foundational-level question, not another tactical one
- If **Emotional Substrate = anxiety** AND **Time Horizon = short**, then you're probably asking a fear-driven question; step up to a longer horizon
- If **Actionability = low** AND **Assumed Answer = already known**, then you're not actually asking a question — you're seeking reassurance
- If **Decomposability = low** (question is compound), then no single answer will satisfy; decompose before continuing

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It's Dangerous | What To Do Instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "There is one right question" | This assumption creates a search for perfection that delays action. Often there are 3-5 good questions and you need to pick one and learn from the answer | Find a GOOD question, not THE question. Run it. Iterate |
| 2 | "The right question feels right immediately" | Good questions often feel uncomfortable because they challenge your frame. If a question feels satisfying, it might just be confirming what you already believe | Be suspicious of questions that feel good. The right question often makes you uneasy |
| 3 | "I need more information before I can ask the right question" | This is a stalling tactic. You have enough information to ask a question now. The question will reveal what information you actually need | Ask the best question you can NOW. The answer tells you what to ask next |
| 4 | "The question should be about the topic" | Often the right question is about YOU — your assumptions, your frame, your goals — not about the external topic | Ask: "What about MY thinking might be wrong?" before asking about the world |
| 5 | "Smart people find the right question through thinking" | The right question usually emerges from CONTACT WITH REALITY — trying things, getting feedback, encountering surprises — not from sitting and thinking | Do something, observe what happens, and let the right question emerge from the gap between expectation and reality |
| 6 | "The right question is the hardest question" | Some of the most powerful questions are embarrassingly simple. "What are we actually trying to do?" is often the right question, and people skip it because it seems too basic | Don't dismiss a question for being simple. Simple questions that nobody is asking are the highest-leverage ones |
| 7 | "Finding the question is the hard part; answering is easy" | Sometimes you find the question and the answer is genuinely unknown, requiring experimentation, not analysis | Finding the question is half the work. Budget equal effort for answering it |
| 8 | "The question stays fixed" | Questions evolve as you learn. The right question today is different from the right question after you've gathered more information | Revisit your question regularly. If new information hasn't changed your question, you're not learning from it |
| 9 | "Other people's questions are my questions" | Adopting someone else's framing means adopting their assumptions and blind spots | Before accepting a question from someone else, ask: "Is this MY question, or theirs?" |
| 10 | "All questions deserve answers" | Some questions are distractions, some are unanswerable, some are the wrong frame entirely. Not every question should be pursued | Before investing in answering a question, ask: "Would the answer change what I do?" If no, drop it |

## Step 4: The Procedure

```
FINDING THE RIGHT QUESTION PROCEDURE
======================================

STEP 0: Why do you need a question?

  Answer this honestly:

  Q1: What is your current situation?
      → I'm stuck on something: Go to SECTION A
      → I'm starting something new: Go to SECTION B
      → Something isn't working: Go to SECTION C
      → I want to understand something: Go to SECTION D
      → Someone asked me to solve a problem: Go to SECTION E

================================================================

SECTION A: YOU'RE STUCK
------------------------

Step A1: WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU'RE STUCK ON
  Action: Complete this sentence in writing:
    "I am trying to _________ but I can't because _________."

  What you should see: A concrete statement with two
  parts — a goal and an obstacle.

  If you can't complete the sentence → your problem isn't
  that you're stuck. You don't have a clear goal. Go to
  SECTION B.

Step A2: CHECK THE OBSTACLE
  Action: Look at the "because" part of your sentence.
  Is the obstacle:

  a) A lack of information? ("I don't know how to...")
     → Your question is: "Where can I find [specific info]?"
     → This is an operational question. It's probably the
        right one. Go find the information. DONE.

  b) A lack of options? ("I can't think of a way to...")
     → Your question is: "What approaches exist that I
        haven't considered?"
     → Go to Step A3.

  c) A conflict between options? ("I can't decide between...")
     → Your question is: "What criteria would make this
        decision obvious?"
     → Go to Step A4.

  d) A feeling? ("I'm afraid to..." / "I don't want to..." /
     "It feels wrong...")
     → Your question is NOT about the task. It's about you.
     → Go to Step A5.

  e) Something external? ("They won't let me..." /
     "I don't have the resources...")
     → Your question is: "Is this constraint real, or
        assumed? And if real, what changes?"
     → Go to Step A6.

Step A3: EXPAND YOUR OPTION SPACE
  Action: List every approach you've already considered.
  Then for each one, ask:
    "What's the OPPOSITE of this approach?"
    "What would a complete beginner try?"
    "What would someone with unlimited resources do?"
    "What would happen if I did nothing?"

  Your question is the one that points at the most
  promising unexplored direction.

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

Step A4: CLARIFY YOUR CRITERIA
  Action: For each option you're deciding between, write:
    "If I choose this, I get _________ but lose _________."

  Now look at what you'd gain and lose. Ask:
    "Which of these gains/losses matters most to me in
     [your time horizon — 1 month? 1 year? 5 years?]?"

  Your question is: "What do I actually value more:
  [gain A] or [gain B]?"

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

Step A5: ADDRESS THE FEELING
  Action: Name the feeling. Write it down.
  Then ask: "What is this feeling protecting me from?"

  Common patterns:
  - Fear → "What's the worst realistic outcome, and
    can I handle it?"
  - Overwhelm → "What is the ONE next thing I need to do?"
  - Perfectionism → "What would 'good enough' look like?"
  - Boredom → "What about this have I outgrown?"
  - Resentment → "What did I agree to that I shouldn't have?"

  Your question is the one above that fits your feeling.

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

Step A6: TEST THE CONSTRAINT
  Action: Write down the constraint. Then answer:

  "Has anyone ever done what I want despite this
   constraint?"
    → Yes → Your question is: "How did they do it?"
    → No  → "Is there a different goal that avoids this
             constraint entirely?"
    → Unsure → "What would I need to check to find out?"

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

================================================================

SECTION B: YOU'RE STARTING SOMETHING NEW
-----------------------------------------

Step B1: DEFINE "DONE"
  Action: Complete this sentence:
    "This is successful when _________."

  If you can't complete the sentence → your question is:
    "What would success look like, concretely?"
  Answer THAT question first, then return to B1.

Step B2: FIND THE RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
  Action: List everything that must be true for your
  "done" definition to be achievable. These are your
  assumptions.

  Rank them: Which is LEAST certain?

  Your question is: "Is [least certain assumption]
  actually true? How would I find out quickly?"

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

================================================================

SECTION C: SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING
------------------------------------

Step C1: SPECIFY THE FAILURE
  Action: Complete this sentence:
    "I expected _________ but instead I got _________."

  If you can't specify what you expected → you didn't
  have a clear goal. Go to SECTION B.

Step C2: LOCATE THE GAP
  Action: The gap between expected and actual has a cause.
  List three possible causes, then for each ask:
    "What evidence would confirm or rule this out?"

  Your question is: "Which of [cause 1 / cause 2 / cause 3]
  is actually responsible, and how can I test it fastest?"

  If you can only think of one cause → WARNING: You're
  probably anchored on the obvious explanation. Ask:
    "What if the obvious cause is wrong? What ELSE
     could produce this result?"

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

================================================================

SECTION D: YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
--------------------------------------------

Step D1: CHECK YOUR MOTIVE
  Action: Ask yourself honestly:
    "If I understood this, what would I DO differently?"

  → Clear action → Your question is about HOW to do
    that action. Go to SECTION A, Step A2a.
  → No clear action → Ask: "Is this curiosity or
    avoidance?" Be honest.
    → Curiosity → Step D2
    → Avoidance → You're procrastinating.
       What are you avoiding? Go to SECTION A, Step A5.

Step D2: FIND THE SPECIFIC CONFUSION
  Action: Write down what you think you understand.
  Then mark the point where your understanding breaks down.

  Your question lives at THAT boundary — the edge
  between what you know and what you don't.

  Frame it as: "I understand [X] but I don't understand
  [Y]. What connects X to Y?"

  → Test your question with Step F1. Go to SECTION F.

================================================================

SECTION E: SOMEONE GAVE YOU A PROBLEM
---------------------------------------

Step E1: CHECK THE FRAME
  Action: Write down the problem as given to you.
  Then ask three questions about it:

  1. "Is this the real problem, or a symptom?"
     → To test: Ask "Why is this a problem?" If the
       answer points to a DIFFERENT problem, follow that
       chain until you hit a root.

  2. "Whose problem is this really?"
     → If it's not yours, your question is: "What's my
       actual role here?" (solver, advisor, supporter,
       affected party?)

  3. "Has the problem-giver already decided the answer?"
     → If yes, they don't want a question — they want
       validation. Your question is: "Do I agree with
       their proposed solution?" If yes, help execute.
       If no, raise your concern.

Step E2: REFRAME IF NEEDED
  Action: If Step E1 revealed a different problem,
  write the NEW problem statement and go to the
  appropriate section (A through D).

  If the problem survived E1 unchanged → it's well-framed.
  Go to the appropriate section based on what type
  of problem it is.

================================================================

SECTION F: VALIDATE YOUR QUESTION
-----------------------------------

Step F1: THE FIVE TESTS
  Apply each test to your candidate question.
  Score: Pass (1) or Fail (0).

  Test 1 — ACTIONABILITY:
    "If I got a clear answer to this question, would
     it change what I do?"
    → Yes = Pass / No = Fail

  Test 2 — SPECIFICITY:
    "Could two different people interpret this question
     differently and give different (valid) answers?"
    → No = Pass / Yes = Fail (too vague, narrow it)

  Test 3 — HONESTY:
    "Am I asking this to learn, or to confirm what I
     already believe?"
    → To learn = Pass / To confirm = Fail (find what
      you're avoiding)

  Test 4 — LEVEL:
    "Is this question at the right level? Could there
     be a deeper question underneath it?"
    → Right level = Pass / Deeper question exists = Fail
      (ask the deeper one)

  Test 5 — ANSWERABILITY:
    "Is there a way — some observation, experiment, or
     analysis — that could answer this question?"
    → Yes = Pass / No = Fail (reframe to be answerable)

  SCORING:
  → 5/5: You have your question. Go pursue the answer.
  → 4/5: Fix the failing test and recheck.
  → 3/5 or below: Go back to your section and dig deeper.
         You're still on the surface.

Step F2: FINAL FORMULATION
  Action: Write your validated question in this format:

    QUESTION: [your question]
    WHY THIS QUESTION: [1 sentence on why this is the
      right thing to ask right now]
    WHAT A GOOD ANSWER LOOKS LIKE: [what form the answer
      would take]
    FIRST STEP TO ANSWER IT: [one concrete action]

  → COMPLETE

================================================================

QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
---------------------

CARD 1: Question-Level Ladder
  If you're asking "How?" → check if you should ask "Should I?"
  If you're asking "Should I?" → check if you should ask "What for?"
  If you're asking "What for?" → check if you should ask "What matters?"
  Always go one level higher than feels natural.

CARD 2: Red Flags That You Have the Wrong Question
  - You already know the answer you want
  - The question has been asked before and the answer didn't help
  - The question makes you feel smart rather than uncertain
  - Everyone around you is asking the same question
  - The question is about blame rather than mechanism

CARD 3: Emergency Shortcut
  When completely lost, ask ONE of these:
  - "What would I do if I couldn't fail?"
  - "What am I avoiding?"
  - "What's the simplest version of this?"
  - "What would change my mind?"
  - "What do I know for sure?"
```

---

## Step 5: Failure Modes

| # | Failure Mode | How to Recognize It | What to Do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Question shopping** | You keep generating questions without committing to one. Each new question feels more exciting than answering the last one | STOP generating. Pick the best question you have and go answer it. You'll learn more from one answered question than ten unasked ones |
| 2 | **False depth** | You keep going "one level deeper" forever. "But why?" loops infinitely. You mistake recursion for insight | Apply the actionability test (F1, Test 1). If going deeper doesn't change what you'd DO, you're deep enough. Stop and act |
| 3 | **Comfort questions** | You ask questions you already know how to answer. "How do I optimize X?" when the real question is "Should I be doing X at all?" | Check: Does this question challenge any of your beliefs? If not, you're in your comfort zone. Ask what you're avoiding |
| 4 | **Scope creep** | Your question keeps expanding. "How do I fix this bug?" becomes "How do I redesign the whole system?" becomes "What's the right architecture for software?" | Apply the decomposability check. If your question can't be answered in a single effort, it's multiple questions. Decompose and pick the first one |
| 5 | **Other people's questions** | You adopted a question from a book, mentor, framework, or cultural norm without checking if it's actually YOUR question | Ask: "If nobody expected me to care about this, would I still ask?" If no, find your own question |
| 6 | **Answering instead of questioning** | You start the procedure but jump to solutions before finishing. "I need to find the right question... oh, I bet the answer is X" | Notice when you shift from questioning to answering. Finish the procedure FIRST. Your premature answer is probably wrong — that's why you needed a better question |
| 7 | **Analysis paralysis via procedure** | You follow every step meticulously and end up with a validated question but no energy or time left to answer it | The procedure should take 15-30 minutes, not hours. If you're spending more, you're overthinking. Set a timer. Pick the best question you have when the timer goes off |
| 8 | **Mistaking novelty for quality** | A surprising question feels like a good question. But surprise alone doesn't mean it's actionable or important | Every novel question still needs to pass the five tests in F1. Novelty is a bonus, not a criterion |

---

## Step 6: Validation Check

Every step reviewed for executability:

- **All steps are concrete actions**: "Complete this sentence," "List three possible causes," "Score Pass or Fail" — no "consider" or "reflect"
- **All decision points are binary or small multiple choice**: Step 0 has 5 options; Step A2 has 5 options; F1 is pass/fail on 5 tests
- **Every path terminates**: All sections route to Section F for validation; F1 either passes (done) or sends you back to a specific section
- **No jargon**: Plain language throughout. "Actionability," "decomposability," and "falsifiability" are used in Step 1 analysis but converted to plain tests in the procedure itself
- **Recursion is bounded**: The "go deeper" loop in Test 4 is bounded by the actionability test — you stop going deeper when deeper doesn't change action

**One limitation**: Step D1's "Is this curiosity or avoidance?" requires honest self-assessment. People who are avoiding something rarely know they're avoiding it. Mitigation: the procedure asks the question directly, which helps, but genuine self-deception will bypass it.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting with "How?" instead of "What?" or "Why?"** — How-questions assume the goal is right. Check the goal first
2. **Asking the question everyone else is asking** — consensus questions produce consensus answers. The right question is often the one nobody is asking
3. **Refusing to ask simple questions** — "What are we actually trying to do?" is the most powerful question in most situations, and the one people are most embarrassed to ask
4. **Treating question-finding as a solo activity** — explaining your problem to someone else often reveals the question faster than thinking alone. The question emerges in the gap between your understanding and theirs
5. **Asking questions in the wrong order** — foundational questions first, operational questions last. "Should I do this?" before "How should I do this?"
6. **Optimizing the question instead of testing it** — a mediocre question that gets answered teaches you more than a perfect question that stays theoretical

## When to Override This Procedure

- **Emergency / time pressure** — skip to the Emergency Shortcut (Card 3). Any question is better than no question when you need to act NOW
- **You already know the question but are stalling** — sometimes you know what to ask and you're using "finding the right question" as procrastination. If a question came to mind immediately and makes you uncomfortable, that's probably it
- **The situation is genuinely novel** — no procedure can navigate a truly unprecedented situation. Use the procedure to get started, then trust your judgment as new information arrives
- **You're in a collaborative context** — finding the right question WITH others is a different process (more dialogic, less procedural). Use this procedure for your own thinking, then bring your best question to the group

---

*Validation status: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts. It synthesizes principles from critical thinking, epistemology, coaching practice, and problem-solving methodology but should be tested on real question-finding situations before relying on it.*
