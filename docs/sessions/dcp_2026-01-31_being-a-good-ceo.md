# CEO EFFECTIVENESS PROCEDURE
============================

**Who this is for**: Anyone serving as CEO (or evaluating a CEO) who wants a mechanical process for assessing and improving CEO performance across ethics, efficiency, and quality.

**How to use**: Start at STEP 0. Follow the instructions. Every step tells you exactly what to do. Don't skip steps.

---

## STEP 0: What type of CEO situation is this?

Answer these three questions:

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| **Company stage?** | (A) Pre-revenue / <20 employees, (B) Growth / 20-500 employees, (C) Scaled / 500+ employees |
| **Current condition?** | (X) Things are generally working, (Y) Significant problems exist, (Z) Crisis / existential threat |
| **CEO tenure?** | (1) First 90 days, (2) 90 days - 2 years, (3) 2+ years |

**Your combination determines your section:**

| If... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Any Z (crisis) | SECTION A: Crisis Mode |
| A + any (early stage) | SECTION B: Startup CEO |
| B or C + Y (problems) | SECTION C: Turnaround Mode |
| B + X (growth working) | SECTION D: Growth CEO |
| C + X (scaled, working) | SECTION E: Scaled CEO |

If tenure = 1 (first 90 days), add **SUPPLEMENT 1** to whichever section you're in.

---

## SECTION A: Crisis Mode

*You're here because an existential threat exists. Ethics, efficiency, and quality all matter, but survival comes first.*

**Step A1: Name the crisis in one sentence.**
Write it down: "The company will [specific bad outcome] within [timeframe] unless [specific thing changes]."

*What you should see*: A concrete, falsifiable statement. If you can't write this sentence, you don't understand the crisis yet. Go talk to 5 people closest to the problem before proceeding.

**Step A2: Triage — what must happen in the next 7 days?**
List every action that, if not taken this week, makes the crisis worse. Maximum 5 items.

*Check*: If your list has more than 5 items, you're not triaging. Force-rank and cut to 5.

**Step A3: Ethical red lines.**
Before taking crisis actions, write down 3-5 things you will NOT do regardless of pressure:
- Will you lay people off without severance? YES / NO
- Will you mislead investors about the situation? YES / NO
- Will you cut safety/compliance corners? YES / NO
- Will you blame specific individuals publicly? YES / NO

*What you should see*: Clear NOs. If you're hedging ("it depends"), you don't have red lines — and you'll cross them under pressure.

**Step A4: Communicate the crisis.**
Within 48 hours, tell these groups what's happening (in this order):
1. Your leadership team — full truth
2. Your board — full truth + your plan
3. All employees — honest summary + what it means for them
4. External stakeholders — as required by law/contract

*Check*: Did you tell each group before they heard it from someone else? If no, your credibility is damaged. Accelerate.

**Step A5: Execute triage list from A2. Daily check-in cycle.**
- Morning: What are today's 3 priorities?
- Evening: What happened? What changed? Update tomorrow's priorities.
- Weekly: Is the crisis getting better or worse? Measure with ONE metric.

**Step A6: When is the crisis over?**
Define this in advance: "The crisis is over when [metric] reaches [threshold] for [duration]."

*When crisis is resolved*: Go to the appropriate non-crisis section (B, D, or E).

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Staying in crisis mode after the crisis passes. If your one metric has been in safe range for 4+ weeks, transition out. Permanent crisis mode destroys the organization.

---

## SECTION B: Startup CEO

*You're here because the company is early-stage. Your job is to find product-market fit and not run out of money.*

**Step B1: Can you state your company's purpose in one sentence a stranger would understand?**
Write it: "We help [specific group] do [specific thing] by [specific method]."

*If you can't*: This is your #1 problem. Nothing else matters until this is clear. Talk to 20 customers/potential customers this week.

**Step B2: Ethics at startup stage — set 3 non-negotiable rules.**
At this stage, you don't need a comprehensive ethics framework. You need 3 rules you'll follow even when desperate:
1. Rule about honesty (e.g., "We never lie to customers about what our product does")
2. Rule about people (e.g., "We never ask people to work without agreeing on compensation first")
3. Rule about money (e.g., "We never misrepresent our financials to investors")

Write them down. Share them with your co-founders. These are not negotiable.

**Step B3: Efficiency at startup stage — the ONE metric.**
Pick ONE metric that tells you if you're making progress. Examples:
- Revenue (if selling)
- Weekly active users (if pre-revenue product)
- Successful experiments per week (if pre-product)

*Check*: Is this metric going up week over week? If yes, keep going. If no for 3+ consecutive weeks, something is wrong — go to Step B5.

**Step B4: Quality at startup stage — minimum viable quality.**
Answer: "What is the minimum quality level where customers will use this AND tell others about it?"

*This is NOT "what quality do we aspire to."* This is the floor below which the product fails to spread.
- Ask 5 current users: "What's the one thing that, if it broke, would make you stop using this?"
- Those answers define your quality floor. Protect those. Everything else can be rough.

**Step B5: Weekly CEO self-check (10 minutes every Friday).**

| Question | Answer | Action if NO |
|---|---|---|
| Did I talk to at least 3 customers this week? | Y/N | Block 3 hours next week for customer calls |
| Is my ONE metric improving? | Y/N | Diagnose: wrong metric, wrong strategy, or wrong execution? |
| Did I spend >50% of my time on the #1 priority? | Y/N | Audit calendar — what stole time? Eliminate or delegate it |
| Am I being honest with my team and investors? | Y/N | Have the hard conversation you're avoiding. Today. |
| Do I still believe in what we're building? | Y/N | Talk to an advisor. This is important. |

---

## SECTION C: Turnaround Mode

*You're here because the company has significant problems but isn't in existential crisis. Something needs to change.*

**Step C1: Diagnose — which dimension is failing?**
Rate each on a 1-5 scale (1 = broken, 5 = excellent):

| Dimension | Score | Evidence (one sentence) |
|---|---|---|
| Product/service quality | _/5 | |
| Customer satisfaction | _/5 | |
| Employee engagement | _/5 | |
| Financial health | _/5 | |
| Operational efficiency | _/5 | |
| Ethical standing | _/5 | |
| Strategic clarity | _/5 | |

*Check*: Did you use EVIDENCE or GUT FEELING for each score? If gut feeling, replace with a real data point before proceeding. Ask someone who would know.

**Step C2: Identify the binding constraint.**
Look at your lowest score. That's probably (but not always) your binding constraint — the one thing that, if fixed, would improve everything else.

Ask: "If this dimension were a 4/5 instead of its current score, would the other low scores improve on their own?"
- If YES → this is your binding constraint. Focus here.
- If NO → test the next-lowest score with the same question.

**Step C3: Pick ONE turnaround lever.**
Based on your binding constraint, choose exactly ONE action from this list:

| If binding constraint is... | Lever |
|---|---|
| Product quality | Replace the head of product/engineering OR redefine quality standards and enforce with gates |
| Customer satisfaction | CEO spends 1 day/week with customers for 8 weeks, then implements top 3 findings |
| Employee engagement | Fix compensation if below market; if at market, fix management (start with skip-level 1:1s to find the real problem) |
| Financial health | Cut the bottom 20% of spend by ROI within 30 days |
| Operational efficiency | Map the top 3 workflows end-to-end, eliminate steps that don't add value |
| Ethical standing | Hire external counsel to audit; fix what they find; communicate transparently |
| Strategic clarity | Lock yourself in a room for 2 days. Produce a 1-page strategy. Cascade to every level in 2 weeks. |

**Step C4: Set a 90-day checkpoint.**
"In 90 days, I expect [binding constraint dimension] to be at [target score] because [specific things will have happened]."

*If the 90-day target isn't met*: The lever was wrong, or execution failed. Diagnose which, then return to C2.

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Trying to fix everything at once. You get ONE lever. If you pick two, you'll execute neither well.

---

## SECTION D: Growth CEO

*You're here because things are working and the company is scaling. Your job is to scale without breaking things.*

**Step D1: Monthly dimension audit (30 minutes, first Monday of each month).**

For each dimension, score and track trend:

| Dimension | This Month | Last Month | Trend | Action needed? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ethics**: Any ethical concerns raised this month? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **Quality**: Customer-reported quality issues trending? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **Efficiency**: Revenue per employee improving? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **People**: Unwanted attrition rate? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **Strategy**: Does the team know the top 3 priorities? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **Culture**: Are behaviors matching stated values? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |
| **Cash**: Months of runway / free cash flow? | _/5 | _/5 | ↑↓→ | Y/N |

*Rule*: If any dimension drops 2+ points in a single month, or trends down for 3 consecutive months, it requires CEO intervention. Go to Step D3.

**Step D2: Quarterly strategic check (2 hours, once per quarter).**

Answer these 5 questions in writing:

1. **What did we say we'd accomplish this quarter?** (List the goals)
2. **What did we actually accomplish?** (Be honest)
3. **Why is there a gap?** (If >20% of goals missed)
4. **What should our top 3 priorities be next quarter?** (Force-rank)
5. **What should we STOP doing?** (At least 1 thing)

Share with leadership team. Get their written disagreements before finalizing.

**Step D3: Intervention protocol (when a dimension is declining).**

1. **Gather data**: Talk to 5 people closest to the problem. Don't share your hypothesis. Ask: "What's happening with [dimension]? What are you seeing?"
2. **Diagnose**: Is the problem a people problem, a process problem, or a strategy problem?
   - People: wrong person in role → make the change within 30 days
   - Process: missing/broken process → design and implement within 30 days
   - Strategy: wrong approach → schedule a strategy session within 2 weeks
3. **Act**: Implement the fix.
4. **Verify**: Check the dimension score 60 days later. Did it improve? If no, you diagnosed wrong. Return to step 1.

**Step D4: Growth-stage ethics protocol.**
As you scale, new ethical situations emerge. Monthly, ask:
- "Did we make any decision this month that I wouldn't want reported in the press?" If yes, reverse it or fix it.
- "Are we pressuring anyone to cut corners?" Ask middle managers directly, not just execs.
- "Do employees have a safe way to raise ethical concerns that bypasses their direct manager?" If no, create one.

**Step D5: Growth-stage quality protocol.**
- Define quality metrics for every product/service. Not aspirational — measured.
- Review quality metrics monthly. If any are declining, treat as Step D3 intervention.
- Every quarter, ask 10 customers: "What's the worst thing about working with us?" Act on the top response.

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Assuming what worked at 50 people works at 200. Every time headcount doubles, revisit processes, communication structures, and delegation patterns. What got you here won't get you there.

---

## SECTION E: Scaled CEO

*You're here because the company is 500+ people and things are generally working. Your job is institutional excellence and long-term positioning.*

**Step E1: Establish the CEO operating rhythm.**

| Cadence | Activity | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Daily | 15-min standup with CoS or EA | Stay informed without micromanaging |
| Weekly | Leadership team meeting (60 min max) | Decisions and blockers only. No status updates. |
| Weekly | 2-3 skip-level 1:1s (rotating) | Ground truth. Unfiltered information. |
| Monthly | Dimension audit (same as D1) | Early warning system |
| Monthly | External: 1 board member, 1 investor, 1 customer | Outside perspective |
| Quarterly | Strategic review (same as D2) | Course correction |
| Annually | Strategy offsite (2 days) | Long-term direction |

*Check*: Is >60% of your time in these structured activities? If yes, you may be over-structured — block 20% for unstructured thinking time. If <30%, you're flying blind.

**Step E2: Scaled ethics — build the system, not the hero.**
You can no longer be personally involved in every ethical decision. Build infrastructure:

1. **Ethics reporting channel** that reaches someone independent of the chain of command (board member, ombudsperson, or external hotline). Verify it works by checking usage quarterly — zero reports means people don't trust it or don't know about it.
2. **Decision documentation**: For any decision affecting >100 people or >$1M, require a one-paragraph "ethical consideration" section. Not a rubber stamp — a genuine pause.
3. **Annual ethical audit**: Hire an external firm to review the top 20 decisions of the year for ethical implications. Share results with the board.

**Step E3: Scaled efficiency — manage the portfolio, not the operations.**
- You should NOT be optimizing individual processes. Your job is portfolio allocation.
- Quarterly: rank every business unit / major initiative by ROI. Bottom 10% gets scrutiny: improve, restructure, or cut.
- Track overhead ratio (non-revenue-generating headcount / total headcount). If trending up without strategic justification, investigate.

**Step E4: Scaled quality — build quality into the system.**
- Every product/service has an owner with quality authority (can stop shipment/release).
- Customer satisfaction scores are reviewed at leadership level monthly.
- Quality incidents get root-cause analysis within 1 week and systemic fix within 30 days.
- Annual: benchmark quality against top 3 competitors. If you're not top 2, this becomes a strategic priority.

**Step E5: Succession and institutional resilience.**
- At this stage, the question isn't just "Am I a good CEO?" but "Is this institution good without me?"
- Have identified successors for yourself and every C-suite role.
- Test resilience: take a real 2-week vacation with no contact. What broke? Fix those dependencies.

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Becoming a figurehead. If your monthly audit scores are all 4-5 and you can't identify what you personally changed in the last quarter, you may be adding less value than you think. Honestly assess whether the org needs you, a different CEO, or a different structure entirely.

---

## SUPPLEMENT 1: First 90 Days (Add to Any Section)

**Week 1-2: Listen.**
- Schedule 1:1s with every direct report (30 min each). Ask: "What's working? What's broken? What would you do if you were CEO?"
- Schedule skip-levels with 10-15 people across the org. Same questions.
- Talk to 5 customers. Ask: "What's it like to work with us?"
- Talk to 3 board members. Ask: "What do you expect from me in the first year?"
- DO NOT make any major changes yet.

**Week 3-4: Diagnose.**
- From your conversations, identify the top 3 problems.
- For each problem, rate: urgency (1-5) and CEO-solvability (1-5).
- Your first priority is the problem with the highest (urgency × solvability) score.

**Week 5-8: Act on ONE thing.**
- Pick your #1 priority. Communicate what you're doing and why.
- Execute. Get a visible win.
- Continue listening — your initial diagnosis may be wrong.

**Week 9-12: Assess and plan.**
- Was your diagnosis correct? Did the intervention work?
- Now set 90-day goals. Maximum 3.
- Communicate these goals to the entire organization.

⚠️ **FAILURE MODE**: Making sweeping changes in the first 30 days. You don't understand the organization yet. The exception: if something is clearly unethical or illegal, act immediately regardless of tenure.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The Weekly CEO Checklist
- [ ] Did I talk to at least 1 customer?
- [ ] Did I make the hard decision I've been avoiding?
- [ ] Did I give honest feedback to someone who needed it?
- [ ] Did I ask "what am I missing?" at least once?
- [ ] Did I protect time for strategic thinking (not just reacting)?

### Card 2: Ethical Decision Quick Test
When facing an ethical dilemma:
1. Would I be comfortable if this decision were public? → If NO, don't do it.
2. Am I rationalizing? (Am I explaining why this is okay despite feeling wrong?) → If YES, don't do it.
3. Who bears the cost of this decision? Is it the people with the least power? → If YES, reconsider.
4. Would I make this same decision if the financial pressure were removed? → If NO, the financial pressure is distorting your ethics.

### Card 3: Quality Triage
When quality problems emerge:
1. Is anyone at physical risk? → YES: Stop everything. Fix now.
2. Is a customer's business at risk? → YES: Fix within 24 hours. CEO-level attention.
3. Is it embarrassing but not harmful? → Fix within 1 week. Delegate but verify.
4. Is it a slow degradation? → Add to monthly review. Track trend.

### Card 4: Efficiency Red Flags
Investigate immediately if you see:
- Headcount growing faster than revenue for 2+ quarters
- Meetings consuming >40% of maker (individual contributor) time
- Decisions taking >2x longer than 6 months ago
- Same problems recurring after being "fixed"
- Teams waiting on other teams for >1 week routinely

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Confusing activity with effectiveness.** Working 80-hour weeks doesn't make you a good CEO. Measure by outcomes (dimension scores), not effort.

2. **Treating ethics as a constraint rather than a capability.** Ethics isn't the thing that limits what you can do — it's the thing that builds the trust that lets you do more.

3. **Optimizing efficiency in the wrong areas.** Cutting costs in customer-facing quality to hit margin targets. This trades a visible metric for an invisible one (customer trust) until the invisible one collapses.

4. **Not firing fast enough.** The #1 regret of experienced CEOs. If you've given clear feedback, provided support, and performance hasn't improved in 90 days, the kind thing is to let them find a role where they can succeed.

5. **Solving problems your team should solve.** If you're the one debugging the issue, you're not doing your job. Your job is to ensure the system produces good solutions, not to produce them yourself.

6. **Ignoring your own health.** A CEO operating on 5 hours of sleep, no exercise, and no relationships outside work will make progressively worse decisions. This isn't self-help advice — it's a performance variable.

7. **Consensus addiction.** Getting everyone aligned before every decision. Some decisions need speed more than buy-in. Know which is which: reversible decisions → decide fast. Irreversible decisions → decide carefully.

8. **Measuring ethics by absence of scandal.** "We haven't had any ethical problems" usually means "we haven't looked" or "people don't feel safe reporting."

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

Seek expert help (executive coach, experienced board member, industry mentor) when:

- You score 2/5 or below on 3+ dimensions simultaneously — the problems are likely interconnected in ways this procedure can't address mechanically
- You're in a regulated industry facing a compliance issue — legal expertise required, not a checklist
- You're considering a major transaction (M&A, IPO, major pivot) — these are unique events requiring situation-specific expertise
- You've been in the same section for 12+ months without improvement — something structural is wrong that self-assessment won't reveal
- You're experiencing personal burnout or loss of conviction — this is a human problem, not a process problem
- The competitive landscape is shifting in ways you don't understand — get external perspective before optimizing internally

---

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Series B SaaS CEO, 80 employees, things going well

**Step 0**: Company stage = B (Growth), Condition = X (working), Tenure = 3 (2+ years) → **SECTION D: Growth CEO**

**Step D1 (Monthly audit)**:
| Dimension | Score | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Ethics | 5/5 | → | No concerns raised |
| Quality | 3/5 | ↓ | NPS dropped 8 points; bug reports up 40% |
| Efficiency | 4/5 | → | Revenue/employee stable |
| People | 4/5 | ↑ | Attrition down after comp adjustment |
| Strategy | 4/5 | → | Team aligned on top 3 |
| Culture | 4/5 | → | Positive engagement scores |
| Cash | 4/5 | → | 18 months runway |

Quality trending down → triggers D3 intervention.

**Step D3**: Talk to 5 engineers and 5 customers. Finding: engineering team is shipping too fast to hit aggressive growth targets, skipping testing. This is a **process problem** (no quality gates) combined with a **strategy problem** (growth targets incompatible with quality standards).

Action: Implement CI/CD quality gates (no deploy without passing tests), adjust sprint velocity targets to include quality metrics. 60-day check: bug reports should be back to baseline.

---

### Example 2: New CEO of 2,000-person manufacturing company, significant problems

**Step 0**: Company stage = C (Scaled), Condition = Y (problems), Tenure = 1 (first 90 days) → **SECTION C: Turnaround Mode** + **SUPPLEMENT 1**

**Supplement 1 (First 90 Days)**: Spends weeks 1-4 listening. Discovers: quality issues causing customer losses, middle management demoralized, strategy unclear after previous CEO departed.

**Step C1 (Diagnose)**:
| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Product quality | 2/5 | Customer defect returns at 8%, industry standard is 2% |
| Customer satisfaction | 2/5 | 3 of top 10 accounts have issued warnings |
| Employee engagement | 2/5 | Survey scores lowest in company history |
| Financial health | 3/5 | Profitable but margin declining |
| Operational efficiency | 3/5 | Comparable to peers |
| Ethical standing | 4/5 | No known issues |
| Strategic clarity | 1/5 | No one can articulate the strategy |

**Step C2 (Binding constraint)**: Lowest is strategic clarity (1/5). Test: "If strategic clarity were 4/5, would other scores improve?" YES — quality and engagement are partly caused by people not knowing what matters. Binding constraint = strategic clarity.

**Step C3 (Lever)**: "Lock yourself in a room for 2 days. Produce a 1-page strategy. Cascade to every level in 2 weeks."

CEO does this. Strategy: "We will be the quality leader in our segment. This means: defect rate below 2% in 12 months, investment in QA infrastructure, and saying no to low-margin high-volume contracts."

**Step C4 (90-day checkpoint)**: "In 90 days, strategic clarity will be 4/5 because every employee will be able to state our top priority (quality leadership) and defect rate improvement will be underway."

---

### Example 3: Founder-CEO facing an ethical dilemma

A growth-stage CEO discovers that the company's biggest customer (30% of revenue) is using the product in a way that harms end users. The sales team has been aware but hasn't raised it because losing this customer would mean layoffs.

**Quick Reference Card 2 (Ethical Decision Quick Test)**:
1. Would I be comfortable if this decision were public? → Continuing to serve this customer knowing the harm = NO
2. Am I rationalizing? → "They're technically not violating our TOS" = YES, rationalizing
3. Who bears the cost? → End users who have no voice in this decision = YES, least powerful
4. Would I make this decision without financial pressure? → NO

**Result**: The procedure says don't continue. But this is a case where SECTION A (Crisis Mode) may apply because losing 30% of revenue is potentially existential.

**Step A3 (Ethical red lines)**: CEO decides: "We will not knowingly facilitate harm to end users."

**Step A2 (Triage)**: (1) Notify customer of policy violation and required changes, (2) Begin accelerated sales pipeline to reduce concentration risk, (3) Model financial impact of customer loss, (4) Prepare for potential layoffs with dignity (severance, outplacement), (5) Communicate to board.

This is the hard version of CEO ethics: when doing the right thing might cost the company. The procedure doesn't make it painless, but it makes it clear.

**Validation status**: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts. It synthesizes common frameworks but should be supplemented with situation-specific mentorship and board guidance.
