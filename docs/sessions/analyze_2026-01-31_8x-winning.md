# Analyze — 8x Winning

## Phase 1: Decomposition

**Decomposition strategy**: Structural — "8x" implies a multiplicative relationship, so the question is: what are the multipliers, and how do they compose?

### The Core Question

Going from 1x to 8x is not "try 8 times harder." Linear effort produces linear results. 8x requires either:
- **One 8x multiplier** (rare, fragile)
- **Three 2x multipliers** (2 × 2 × 2 = 8)
- **A mix** (e.g., 2x × 4x, or 2x × 2x × 2x)

The decomposition focuses on where multiplicative (not additive) gains come from.

### The 8 Multiplier Domains

**1. Game Selection (potential: 2x–10x)**
- The single highest-leverage variable. Playing the right game matters more than playing well.
- A mediocre player in a great game beats an excellent player in a dying one.
- Most people never question the game. They inherited it from school, industry norms, or social pressure.
- 8x question: *"Am I in the top game available to me, or just the default one?"*

**2. Leverage Type (potential: 2x–100x)**
- Naval Ravikant's framework: labor, capital, code, media. Each is a form of leverage.
- Labor leverage: linear. You hire 8 people, you get ~3-4x (management overhead eats the rest).
- Capital leverage: multiplicative, but requires access.
- Code/media leverage: multiplicative with near-zero marginal cost. This is where modern 8x lives.
- 8x question: *"Am I applying a leverage type that scales, or one that adds?"*

**3. Timing (potential: 2x–5x)**
- Same action, different timing, wildly different results.
- Early in a wave: compounding time works for you. Late: diminishing returns.
- "The best time to plant a tree" — but the second-best time reveals whether you're actually 8x-serious or just nostalgic.
- 8x question: *"Is my timing adding a multiplier or a drag?"*

**4. Skill Stacking (potential: 2x–4x)**
- Being top-10% in one skill: common. Top-10% in two complementary skills: rare. Three: extremely rare.
- Scott Adams's model: "Be good (not great) at two or more things."
- The combination creates a unique niche where competition is thin.
- 8x question: *"What's my second or third skill that multiplies my first?"*

**5. Feedback Speed (potential: 2x–3x)**
- Faster feedback → faster learning → faster compounding.
- The person who gets 100 reps of feedback while you get 10 isn't 10x more experienced — they're on a different curve entirely.
- Tightening the feedback loop is almost always available and almost always underinvested.
- 8x question: *"How do I cut my feedback cycle in half, twice?"*

**6. Asymmetric Bets (potential: 2x–10x)**
- Winning 8x doesn't mean winning 8x as often. It can mean winning much bigger when you do win.
- Capped downside, uncapped upside. Taleb's barbell.
- Most people bet symmetrically (risk $1 to gain $1). 8x players structure for convexity.
- 8x question: *"What's my ratio of upside to downside on current bets?"*

**7. Elimination (potential: 1.5x–3x)**
- Addition is intuitive. Subtraction is where the multipliers hide.
- Every low-value commitment you keep is a tax on your high-value ones.
- Warren Buffett's "avoid-at-all-cost" list. Essentialism. Saying no.
- 8x question: *"What am I doing at 1x that's blocking my 8x?"*

**8. Compounding Duration (potential: 2x–∞)**
- The most underestimated multiplier. Not quitting is a strategy.
- At 15% annual improvement, you double in ~5 years and 8x in ~15.
- Most people reset (new job, new field, new strategy) before compounding kicks in.
- 8x question: *"Have I been in my current game long enough for compounding to work?"*

### MECE Check

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Mutually Exclusive | Each domain targets a different lever. Minor overlap between Game Selection and Leverage Type (choosing a game partly means choosing a leverage type), but the decisions are distinct. |
| Collectively Exhaustive | Covers: what you play, how you amplify, when you act, what you stack, how fast you learn, how you structure bets, what you remove, and how long you persist. Gap check: **Relationships/network** is implicit in leverage but could be its own domain. Accepting this as covered under Leverage Type (labor/social capital). |

### Dependency Map

```
Game Selection ──→ Leverage Type ──→ Asymmetric Bets
      │                                     │
      ↓                                     ↓
Skill Stacking ──→ Feedback Speed ──→ Compounding Duration
                                            ↑
Elimination ────────────────────────────────┘
Timing ──────── cross-cuts everything
```

**Critical path**: Game Selection → Leverage Type → Compounding Duration. If any of these three are wrong, the other five can't compensate.

## Phase 2: Synthesis

### The 8x Formula

The practical path to 8x is **three 2x multipliers stacked**:

```
Pick: 2x from Game Selection or Leverage Type (the structural multipliers)
Add:  2x from Skill Stacking or Asymmetric Bets (the strategic multipliers)
Hold: 2x from Elimination or Compounding Duration (the patience multipliers)

2 × 2 × 2 = 8
```

### Why Most People Stay at 1x

| Trap | What happens | Which multiplier it kills |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Default game | Never question the game they're in | Game Selection |
| Linear effort | Work harder instead of differently | Leverage Type |
| Breadth without depth | Start over every 2-3 years | Compounding Duration |
| Symmetric betting | Risk $1 to make $1 | Asymmetric Bets |
| Addition addiction | Keep adding commitments, never subtract | Elimination |
| Slow loops | Monthly feedback when weekly was possible | Feedback Speed |

### The Key Insight

**8x is not about being 8x better. It's about being multiplicatively positioned.** The difference between 1x and 8x performers is rarely talent or effort — it's the structure of their decisions. Three correct structural choices, each providing a modest 2x, compound to 8x. Three incorrect ones, each imposing a 0.5x drag, compound to 0.125x — which is why some very talented people produce almost nothing.

### Recommended Next Steps

| If you want to... | Use |
|---|---|
| Audit which game you're playing | `/gu` (goal understanding) → `/ve` (value elicitation) |
| Find your highest-leverage multiplier | `/lp` (leverage points) |
| Identify what to eliminate | `/im` (inversion) — "What guarantees I stay at 1x?" |
| Design asymmetric bets | `/fla` (failure anticipation) + `/snp` (scenario planning) |
| Stack skills deliberately | `/ska` (skill acquisition) + `/dd` (dimension discovery) |
| Build a compounding strategy | `/dsd` (derive strategy from desired state) |
