    - Nothing significant. The main cost is [R109] — tension with writing                                                                                                               
      traditions that treat quality as partly intuitive. But [R120-R121] resolves                                                                                                       
      this: intuition is unarticulated criteria detection.

  1. CRITERIA vs METHODS is the fundamental refactoring the writing skill needs.                                                                                                        
     Criteria define what satisfying writing IS (objective properties). Methods are                                                                                                     
     ways to produce those properties. Methods are Goodhartable. Criteria are not.                                                                                                      
     The current skill is mostly methods. [R11-R14, R122-R124, R135-R136]                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. A satisfying CLAIM sits at the intersection of RECOGNITION and ADVANCEMENT.                                                                                                        
     The reader recognizes it from their experience (no evaluation needed) AND it                                                                                                       
     connects that experience to the question in a way they hadn't noticed.                                                                                                             
     Recognition alone = obvious ("yes, and?"). Advancement alone = analytical                                                                                                          
     ("I'd need to check that"). Both = satisfying ("oh, of course — and that                                                                                                           
     means..."). [R66-R72]                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. Criteria are HIERARCHICAL. Upstream (question, recognition, advancement,                                                                                                           
     momentum, non-skippability, reader-drawn conclusion) determine whether writing                                                                                                     
     works AT ALL. Downstream (scope, voice, rhythm, precision) determine how well.                                                                                                     
     Five drafts fixed downstream while upstream was broken — producing polished,                                                                                                       
     empty text. [R40-R43, R125-R131]                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  4. Every criterion is TESTABLE with binary questions. "Have you experienced this?"

     quality is fully operationalizable. [R137-R142]                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  5. "Satisfying" is not subjective — it is a response to objective properties,                                                                                                         
     the way pain is a response to tissue damage. The feeling is subjective. The                                                                                                        
     cause is objective. "I can't say why it's good" means "I detect properties I

[R2-R3, R104, R119-R121]                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  6. Each draft failure discovered a criterion. Draft 1: structure. Draft 2:

     The failures ARE the specification being built. [R27-R33, R132-R133]                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  7. The upstream criteria discovered so far form a proof-like structure:                                                                                                               
     an unresolved question the reader cares about → steps that are each recognized                                                                                                     
     from experience AND connect that experience to the question in a new way →                                                                                                         
     each step creates the question the next step answers (momentum) → no step                                                                                                          
     is skippable → the reader draws the conclusion themselves. [R116, R126]                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  8. For AI writing specifically: if criteria are fully specified and testable,                                                                                                         
     the generation problem is solvable through iteration — check output against

  The core finding: writing quality is objective criteria, not subjective taste, and the criteria are hierarchical. The writing skill should be refactored from methods (how to write)  
  to criteria (what satisfying writing IS) with binary tests for each. The upstream criteria — unresolved question, recognition + advancement at every step, momentum, non-skippability,
   reader-drawn conclusion — determine whether writing works at all. Five drafts failed because they fixed downstream criteria while upstream was broken.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  The key criterion at the claim level: each sentence must be recognized from the reader's experience AND connect that experience to the question in a way they hadn't noticed before.  
  Recognition alone is obvious. Advancement alone requires analysis. Both together is satisfying.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Should I refactor the writing skill now based on this — criteria with binary tests, hierarchically organized — and then tackle Draft 6?
