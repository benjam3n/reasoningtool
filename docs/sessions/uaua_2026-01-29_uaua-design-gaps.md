# UAUA 8x: Why UAUA Underperforms on Design Tasks

Input: "The UAUA skill may be missing some dimensions. It doesn't seem to be doing very good in terms of design. Analyze why that is the case and how to rectify."

---

## U1: SPACE MAPPING — What Dimensions Could UAUA Be Missing?

### Applying All 12 Universalization Techniques

**1. STATE SPACE — What states could "UAUA applied to design" be in?**
- Working perfectly (user expectation wrong)
- Working but producing wrong output type (analytical instead of generative)
- Working but missing critical input dimensions (the tool can't see what matters)
- Fundamentally mismatched to design tasks (wrong tool for the job)
- Partially working — captures some design dimensions, misses others
- Working but at wrong abstraction level (too abstract for pixel-level decisions)

**2. INSTANCE-TO-CATEGORY — What is "design task" an instance of?**
- Design is an instance of: generative/creative problem-solving
- Siblings in this category: writing, architecture, music composition, engineering design, UX design, game design
- UAUA was designed for: analytical/evaluative problem-solving
- The category mismatch: GENERATIVE vs EVALUATIVE reasoning
- Design is also an instance of: embodied/perceptual judgment (you SEE whether it works)
- Siblings: wine tasting, music appreciation, physical skill — things where the body/senses evaluate, not just logic

**3. PARAMETER VARIATION — What parameters of design does UAUA not parameterize?**
- Visual weight and hierarchy (no parameter in UAUA)
- Spatial relationships (proximity, alignment, grouping — Gestalt)
- Color perception (contrast ratios, color harmony, emotional response)
- Typography scale and rhythm (vertical rhythm, modular scales)
- Motion and transition (easing curves, duration, choreography)
- Density/whitespace ratio (information density vs breathing room)
- Material metaphor (shadows, elevation, texture — what "surface" is this?)
- Responsive behavior (how layout transforms across breakpoints)
- Polish level (pixel-perfect alignment, sub-pixel rendering, antialiasing)
- Reference comparison (does this look like sites I respect?)

**4. ROLE REVERSAL — What if the designer evaluated UAUA instead of UAUA evaluating design?**
- A designer would say: "This tool asks me to list candidates and test them. But design isn't about candidates — it's about composition. The whole is not the sum of parts."
- A designer would say: "You're testing whether individual decisions are right/wrong. But design quality emerges from the RELATIONSHIPS between decisions, not the decisions individually."
- A designer would say: "Where's the mood board? Where's the visual reference? You're reasoning about visuals without looking at anything."

**5. EXISTENCE CHECK — Does the problem actually exist as stated?**
- YES: The UAUA 16x on the website DID produce improvements but ALSO missed things
- Specific misses: the output was analytical (change accent to #2563eb) not compositional (here's how all elements relate)
- The improvements were CSS-variable-level, not design-system-level
- It produced individual fixes, not a coherent visual language

**6. CAUSAL REVERSAL — What if UAUA isn't causing bad design; bad design input is causing bad UAUA?**
- UAUA can only work with what it's given
- If the input is "the website looks bad" — that's a vague perceptual judgment, not a decomposable claim
- UAUA needs propositional input; design problems are often pre-propositional (felt before articulated)
- The causal chain might be: vague input → UAUA forces premature decomposition → loses the gestalt → produces analytical fixes that miss the whole

**7. TEMPORAL VARIATION — When in the design process should UAUA apply?**
- BEFORE designing: good for strategy (what kind of site? what audience?)
- DURING designing: bad — design needs flow, not stop-and-evaluate
- AFTER designing: good for critique (does this achieve goals?)
- UAUA currently applies AT ALL STAGES the same way — no temporal awareness

**8. BOUNDARY DISSOLUTION — What if we expanded "design" beyond visual?**
- Information architecture (content structure, navigation)
- Interaction design (what happens when you click, hover, scroll)
- Content strategy (what words, what tone, what order)
- Performance design (perceived speed, loading states)
- Emotional design (what feeling does this evoke)
- UAUA handles information architecture well (it's structural/logical)
- UAUA handles visual and emotional design poorly (they're perceptual/aesthetic)

**9. MODALITY SHIFT — What certainty level does design operate at?**
- Design operates in TASTE, not TRUTH
- UAUA operates in TRUTH (claims are right/wrong)
- Taste is: educated preference informed by pattern exposure
- You can't ARAW taste — "this shade of blue is better" isn't a testable claim
- You CAN ARAW design STRATEGY — "users need X before Y" IS testable
- The modality mismatch: UAUA treats design decisions as propositions when they're actually aesthetic judgments

**10. PERSPECTIVE ROTATION — Whose perspective does design serve?**
- End user (does this feel professional/trustworthy/clear?)
- Brand (does this express identity?)
- Developer (is this maintainable?)
- Business (does this convert?)
- UAUA rotates perspectives but all through the SAME analytical lens
- A user doesn't think "the accent color has insufficient contrast ratio" — they think "this looks cheap" or "this looks professional"
- UAUA misses the FELT experience perspective

**11. SCALE VARIATION — At what scale does design quality emerge?**
- Pixel level: alignment, spacing, anti-aliasing
- Component level: card design, button design, form design
- Page level: layout, hierarchy, flow
- Site level: consistency, navigation, information architecture
- Brand level: identity, voice, feeling
- UAUA works at component and site level
- UAUA misses pixel level (too granular) and brand/feeling level (too qualitative)

**12. NEGATION REFRAME — What if the problem isn't UAUA missing dimensions, but UAUA being the wrong tool?**
- What if design needs a DIFFERENT kind of procedure entirely?
- What if the fix is not "add dimensions to UAUA" but "use UAUA for strategy, use something else for execution"?
- What if design needs a reference-based procedure (compare to exemplars) rather than a logic-based procedure (assume right/wrong)?

### CANDIDATES for A1 (Top 8)

1. **UAUA lacks perceptual/aesthetic dimensions** — it only has logical/propositional ones
2. **UAUA decomposes when design needs composition** — breaking things apart loses the gestalt
3. **UAUA treats design as truth-finding when it's taste-forming** — wrong epistemology
4. **UAUA has no reference/exemplar mechanism** — can't compare to known-good designs
5. **UAUA applies uniformly when design needs phase-awareness** — strategy vs execution
6. **UAUA's universalization techniques are logic-biased** — 12 techniques, 0 are perceptual
7. **UAUA can't represent spatial relationships** — design is fundamentally spatial
8. **UAUA produces individual fixes instead of coherent systems** — atomistic vs holistic

[T:result] U1 produced 12 universalizations across all techniques, 8 candidates

## A1: CANDIDATE TESTING

### CANDIDATE 1: UAUA lacks perceptual/aesthetic dimensions

**AR: UAUA only has logical/propositional dimensions**
├── The 12 universalization techniques are ALL cognitive/logical
│   ├── State space, instance-to-category, parameter variation — these are set theory operations
│   ├── None ask: "What does this look like?" or "What does this feel like?"
│   ├── AR: This is by design — UAUA descended from mathematical problem-solving
│   │   ├── The essay "Universal Principles" is about math, not design
│   │   ├── Math has no perceptual component — correctness is binary
│   │   └── AW: But the toolkit claims to be universal. If it only works for logic, it's not universal.
│   │       ├── AR: "Universal" means universal within its domain (structured reasoning)
│   │       │   └── AW: Then it should say so. "Universal" without qualifier implies all domains.
│   │       └── AW: Design IS structured reasoning, just with different primitives
│   │           ├── AR: Design has structure (grids, scales, hierarchies) — these ARE reasonable-about
│   │           │   └── But UAUA doesn't know about DESIGN structures, only LOGICAL structures
│   │           └── AW: Design structure is emergent, not decomposable the way logic is
│   └── AW: The techniques COULD discover perceptual dimensions if applied creatively
│       ├── AR: "Perspective rotation" COULD include "the user's visual impression"
│       │   ├── But in practice it rotates through stakeholder INTERESTS, not sensory EXPERIENCES
│       │   └── The technique description says "Whose view?" — implying cognitive view, not visual
│       └── AW: Even with creative application, the output format (claims, AR/AW) can't represent "this feels off"
│           └── AR: You CAN claim "this feels off" and ARAW it
│               └── AW: But "feels off" decomposes into taste, and taste isn't propositional
│                   └── [CRUX 1: Can aesthetic judgments be meaningfully decomposed into testable claims?]

**AW: UAUA does have some perceptual capacity**
├── "Parameter variation" could vary visual parameters (color, size, spacing)
│   ├── AR: In theory yes. In practice, the procedure never mentions visual parameters.
│   │   └── The examples are all "what if parameters varied?" — abstract, not visual
│   └── AW: A skilled designer using UAUA might naturally inject visual parameters
│       ├── AR: That's the designer's skill, not UAUA's
│       │   └── A tool that only works when the user already knows the answer isn't helping
│       └── AW: All tools require domain knowledge to apply well
│           └── AR: But good tools ENCODE domain knowledge. UAUA encodes zero design knowledge.
│               └── [CRUX 2: Should UAUA encode domain-specific knowledge, or remain domain-agnostic?]

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: The 12 universalization techniques are entirely logic/cognition-based. None reference perception, aesthetics, spatial relationships, or sensory experience. This is a genuine structural gap.

---

### CANDIDATE 2: UAUA decomposes when design needs composition

**AR: Design quality is holistic — breaking it apart loses the whole**
├── Gestalt psychology: the whole is greater than sum of parts
│   ├── A card with correct shadow, correct radius, correct spacing can still look wrong
│   │   ├── AR: Because relationships between elements matter more than individual properties
│   │   │   ├── Proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast (PARC) — these are RELATIONAL
│   │   │   ├── UAUA tests individual claims, not claim-relationships
│   │   │   │   └── AW: UAUA can test relational claims: "The spacing between X and Y is correct"
│   │   │   │       ├── AR: But you'd need to enumerate ALL relationships, which is O(n²)
│   │   │   │       │   └── And you'd still miss emergent properties
│   │   │   │       └── AW: Designers don't enumerate relationships either — they compose intuitively
│   │   │   │           └── AR: Exactly. Design requires intuitive composition, which is non-procedural.
│   │   │   │               └── [CRUX 3: Can procedural reasoning capture compositional design quality?]
│   │   │   └── AW: UAUA's synthesis step IS supposed to capture inter-claim relationships
│   │   │       └── AR: But synthesis happens AFTER decomposition. The damage is done.
│   │   │           └── You can't recompose what you've decomposed if the decomposition lost relational info
│   │   └── AW: Decomposition works for design in specific ways
│   │       ├── Information architecture decomposes naturally (sitemap, nav structure)
│   │       ├── Content hierarchy decomposes (H1 > H2 > body > caption)
│   │       └── Design systems decompose (tokens > components > patterns > pages)
│   │           └── AR: These are the STRUCTURAL aspects of design. The AESTHETIC aspects don't decompose.
│   │               └── [NOVEL] There are two kinds of design: structural (decomposable) and aesthetic (compositional)
│   └── AW: Architecture decomposes buildings, and buildings have aesthetics
│       ├── AR: Architecture has RULES (golden ratio, proportion systems, material constraints)
│       │   └── These rules are testable propositions — UAUA could handle them
│       └── AW: But architects also work from sketches, models, precedent studies — not just rules
│           └── AR: The sketch/model/precedent process is exactly what UAUA lacks

**AW: Decomposition does work for some design tasks**
├── Usability testing decomposes: task success rate, time on task, error rate
├── Accessibility decomposes: contrast ratio, focus order, alt text
├── Performance decomposes: load time, LCP, CLS
├── These are the measurable, testable aspects of design
└── AR: These are design ENGINEERING, not design AESTHETICS. Different discipline.
    └── [NOVEL] Design = engineering (decomposable, testable) + aesthetics (compositional, felt)

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: UAUA decomposes effectively for structural/engineering design but fails for aesthetic/compositional design. The holistic quality that makes something "look professional" vs "look amateur" resists decomposition.

---

### CANDIDATE 3: UAUA treats design as truth-finding when it's taste-forming

**AR: Design operates in taste, not truth**
├── "This blue is better than that blue" — not a truth claim, a taste claim
│   ├── AR: Taste is informed by pattern exposure (seeing thousands of good designs)
│   │   ├── Designers develop taste through exposure, not reasoning
│   │   ├── UAUA has no exposure mechanism — it reasons from first principles
│   │   │   └── AW: Claude (the LLM) HAS been exposed to millions of designs in training data
│   │   │       ├── AR: Yes, but UAUA doesn't activate that knowledge — it overrides it with procedure
│   │   │       │   ├── [NOVEL] UAUA may actually SUPPRESS the LLM's implicit design knowledge
│   │   │       │   │   by forcing analytical decomposition instead of allowing gestalt response
│   │   │       │   ├── AR: This is the key insight. The LLM knows what looks good.
│   │   │       │   │   UAUA forces it to JUSTIFY what looks good, which is harder and often wrong.
│   │   │       │   │   └── AW: Justification is valuable — "it just looks good" isn't actionable
│   │   │       │   │       ├── AR: It IS actionable if you trust the judgment and iterate
│   │   │       │   │       │   └── "Make the hero smaller" is more actionable than "ARAW the hero size"
│   │   │       │   │       └── AW: Without justification, you can't improve systematically
│   │   │       │   │           └── AR: Designers improve by comparing to references, not by logical analysis
│   │   │       │   │               └── [CRUX 4: Does design improve through analysis or through comparison to exemplars?]
│   │   │       │   └── AW: UAUA adds structure that prevents hallucinated design confidence
│   │   │       │       └── AR: But adds structure that produces hallucinated design ANALYSIS
│   │   │       │           └── Confident-sounding analytical justification for bad design choices
│   │   │       └── AW: Training data exposure is passive. UAUA is active reasoning.
│   │   │           └── AR: For design, passive exposure (taste) may be MORE reliable than active reasoning
│   │   └── AW: Some design IS truth — accessibility standards, readability research, Fitts's law
│   │       └── AR: These are the engineering parts again. They ARE truth-amenable.
│   └── AW: Taste can be decomposed into principles (contrast, hierarchy, alignment, repetition)
│       ├── AR: These principles are necessary but not sufficient
│       │   └── You can follow all principles and still produce mediocre design
│       │       └── The gap between "follows principles" and "looks great" is taste
│       └── AW: Principles + exemplar comparison might be sufficient
│           └── AR: This is closer — and it's what UAUA is missing (the exemplar part)

**AW: UAUA could test design claims that ARE truth-amenable**
├── "Users will find this navigation intuitive" — testable
├── "This color scheme conveys professionalism" — somewhat testable (via reference comparison)
├── "This layout prioritizes the right content" — testable against goals
└── AR: These are valid uses. The problem is UAUA tries to do MORE than this.
    └── It tries to evaluate aesthetics using the same machinery as logic. That's the mismatch.

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: Design straddles truth and taste. UAUA only operates in truth-space. It works for the truth-amenable parts of design (usability, accessibility, content strategy) but fails for the taste-dependent parts (visual quality, polish, "feel").

---

### CANDIDATE 4: UAUA has no reference/exemplar mechanism

**AR: Design professionals rely heavily on references and precedent**
├── Designers use mood boards, style guides, precedent studies
│   ├── "Make it look like Stripe" is more effective than "make it look professional"
│   │   ├── AR: Because "Stripe" encodes thousands of micro-decisions that can be transferred
│   │   │   ├── Color palette, spacing scale, typography, shadow system, interaction patterns
│   │   │   ├── None of these need to be REASONED — they can be REFERENCED
│   │   │   │   └── AW: Blind copying produces derivative work
│   │   │   │       ├── AR: Referencing ≠ copying. It's extracting patterns.
│   │   │   │       │   └── All design is informed by precedent. Originality is recombination.
│   │   │   │       └── AW: UAUA could discover these patterns through analysis
│   │   │   │           └── AR: UAUA analyzing Stripe would take hours. Looking at Stripe takes seconds.
│   │   │   │               └── [CRUX 5: Is visual reference more efficient than analytical decomposition for design?]
│   │   │   └── AW: Reference-based design has limits — someone has to create the original
│   │   │       └── AR: The original creator also used references — they just recombined further back
│   │   └── AW: "Make it look like Stripe" only works if you know what Stripe looks like
│   │       └── AR: The LLM knows what Stripe looks like (from training data)
│   │           └── But UAUA doesn't ask "what does Stripe look like?" — it asks "what are the claims?"
│   ├── UAUA's 12 techniques never say "find exemplars" or "compare to reference"
│   │   ├── AR: This is a concrete, fixable gap
│   │   │   └── Add technique 13: EXEMPLAR COMPARISON — "What known-good examples exist in this domain?"
│   │   └── AW: Universalization technique #2 (instance-to-category) COULD find exemplars
│   │       └── AR: It finds categorical siblings, not quality exemplars. "What category?" ≠ "What's the best example?"
│   └── The website UAUA 16x DID reference Stripe, Linear, Tailwind — but only because the user mentioned them
│       ├── AR: UAUA didn't generate those references itself — the user supplied them
│       │   └── If the user hadn't, UAUA would have analyzed in a vacuum
│       └── AW: A good operator supplies domain context. This is expected.
│           └── AR: A good TOOL should prompt for or generate relevant context, not rely on the operator

**AW: UAUA can work without references**
├── For novel/unprecedented designs, there ARE no references
│   └── AR: Even novel designs are informed by adjacent precedent
├── References can constrain creativity
│   └── AR: Constraint is valuable — unconstrained design is usually worse
│       └── [NOVEL] Design constraint (references, systems, grids) actually IMPROVES quality by reducing the search space

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: UAUA has zero mechanisms for exemplar identification, comparison, or pattern extraction from references. This is a concrete gap that could be fixed by adding a reference/exemplar technique.

---

### CANDIDATE 5: UAUA applies uniformly when design needs phase-awareness

**AR: Design has distinct phases requiring different reasoning**
├── Discovery/Strategy: "What should we build?" — UAUA works well here
│   ├── This is analytical, propositional, decomposable
│   └── UAUA's strengths align: explore options, test assumptions, find edge cases
├── Exploration/Ideation: "What could it look like?" — UAUA works poorly
│   ├── This needs divergent VISUAL generation, not divergent LOGICAL generation
│   │   ├── AR: Universalization generates logical alternatives. Design needs visual alternatives.
│   │   │   └── "Try 5 different layouts" vs "consider 5 different claims about layout"
│   │   └── AW: Logical alternatives can guide visual alternatives
│   │       └── AR: They can, but with high translation cost and information loss
│   └── Sketching, wireframing, prototyping — fundamentally generative, not evaluative
├── Execution/Refinement: "Is this good enough?" — UAUA could work if adapted
│   ├── Comparing output against goals IS evaluative
│   │   └── But comparing against taste/exemplars requires reference mechanism (see Candidate 4)
│   └── The refinement loop is: look → feel → adjust → repeat. Not: claim → AR → AW → verdict.
├── Polish: "Make it perfect" — UAUA irrelevant
│   ├── Pixel-level polish is sensory-motor skill, not reasoning
│   └── Sub-pixel alignment, animation easing, shadow tuning — these are CRAFT
│       └── [NOVEL] Design craft (polish) is fundamentally non-propositional. No reasoning tool can help.
│           └── AW: Reasoning can identify WHAT needs polish. Craft executes the polish.
│               └── AR: Valid distinction. UAUA could identify "the shadow looks wrong" but not fix it.

**AW: Uniform application has benefits**
├── Consistent methodology across phases reduces cognitive overhead
│   └── AR: But applying the wrong tool consistently is consistently wrong
├── Phase boundaries are fuzzy — hard to know when to switch
│   └── AR: Better to approximate phase-awareness than ignore phases entirely

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: UAUA performs well for design strategy, poorly for visual ideation, partially for critique, and not at all for craft/polish. A phase-aware variant would be more effective.

---

### CANDIDATE 6: UAUA's universalization techniques are logic-biased

**AR: All 12 techniques come from logical/mathematical reasoning**
├── STATE SPACE — set theory
├── INSTANCE-TO-CATEGORY — classification/taxonomy
├── PARAMETER VARIATION — function analysis
├── ROLE REVERSAL — game theory
├── EXISTENCE CHECK — logic
├── CAUSAL REVERSAL — causal reasoning
├── TEMPORAL VARIATION — temporal logic
├── BOUNDARY DISSOLUTION — scope analysis
├── MODALITY SHIFT — modal logic
├── PERSPECTIVE ROTATION — stakeholder analysis
├── SCALE VARIATION — dimensional analysis
├── NEGATION REFRAME — logical negation
│
├── AR: Every single one is a LOGICAL operation. None are:
│   ├── VISUAL COMPARISON — "What does this look like? What does the exemplar look like?"
│   ├── EMOTIONAL RESPONSE — "How does this make you feel? How should it feel?"
│   ├── SENSORY EVALUATION — "What do you see/hear/touch?"
│   ├── PATTERN MATCHING — "What known-good pattern does this match or violate?"
│   ├── COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS — "How do elements relate spatially?"
│   ├── MATERIAL ANALYSIS — "What surface/texture/weight does this convey?"
│   │   └── [CRUX 6: Would adding perceptual techniques to UAUA's universalization fix the design gap?]
│   └── AW: These could be added as techniques 13-18
│       ├── AR: Adding 6 perceptual techniques would make UAUA 18-technique, which is a lot
│       │   └── AW: Or create a domain variant: UAUA-Design with 12 logic + 6 perceptual
│       │       └── AR: This is the most practical fix — domain-specific technique sets
│       │           └── [CRUX 7: Should UAUA have domain-specific technique variants?]
│       └── AW: The techniques are guides, not exhaustive. Users can apply them creatively.
│           └── AR: Users DON'T apply them creatively — they follow the procedure as written
│               └── This is documented in ARAW's Principle 1: "ENUMERATION MODE (incorrect)"
│               └── The procedure's format becomes the ceiling, not the floor

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: All 12 techniques are logical operations. Adding perceptual/aesthetic techniques (either universally or as domain variants) would directly address the gap.

---

### CANDIDATE 7: UAUA can't represent spatial relationships

**AR: Design is fundamentally spatial**
├── Layout is spatial composition
├── Hierarchy is spatial ordering (size, position, contrast)
├── Grouping is spatial proximity (Gestalt)
│   ├── AR: UAUA's output format is text/tree — it has no spatial representation
│   │   ├── You can't DESCRIBE good spacing; you have to SEE it
│   │   │   └── AW: CSS values are textual descriptions of spatial relationships
│   │   │       └── AR: CSS values without visual context are meaningless
│   │   │           └── `margin-top: 6rem` — is that too much? Can't know without seeing it.
│   │   │               └── [CRUX 8: Does textual reasoning about visual properties produce valid design?]
│   │   └── AW: UAUA could reason about spatial PRINCIPLES without spatial REPRESENTATION
│   │       └── AR: "Use consistent spacing" is a valid principle. But the VALUE of that spacing is perceptual.
│   │           └── The principle is propositional. The execution is perceptual. UAUA handles the principle, not the execution.
│   └── AW: Many spatial decisions CAN be reasoned about
│       ├── "Is the most important content above the fold?" — yes/no
│       ├── "Does the nav follow convention?" — yes/no
│       ├── "Is there a clear visual hierarchy?" — somewhat testable
│       └── AR: These are STRUCTURAL spatial claims. They work. AESTHETIC spatial claims don't.

**VERDICT: VALIDATED (partial)**
Reason: UAUA can reason about spatial structure (hierarchy, grouping, flow) but cannot evaluate spatial aesthetics (proportion, rhythm, visual weight). This is a subset of the broader perception gap.

### CANDIDATE 8: UAUA produces individual fixes instead of coherent systems

**AR: The UAUA 16x website analysis produced a list of individual changes**
├── Change accent to #2563eb ✓
├── Change border opacity ✓
├── Add section spacing ✓
├── Compress hero ✓
├── Add shadow to cards ✓
│   ├── AR: Each change was individually reasonable but the result wasn't a coherent system
│   │   ├── AR: Because UAUA tested each dimension independently
│   │   │   ├── Color was ARW'd separately from spacing was ARW'd separately from layout
│   │   │   ├── But in design, color INTERACTS with spacing which INTERACTS with layout
│   │   │   │   └── AW: The synthesis step should capture interactions
│   │   │   │       └── AR: Synthesis comes AFTER individual analysis. It can't retroactively create coherence.
│   │   │   │           └── A design system needs to be DESIGNED as a system, not assembled from parts.
│   │   │   │               └── [NOVEL] UAUA's decompose-then-synthesize flow is backwards for design.

│   └── AW: A second pass could create coherence
│       └── AR: But that requires a DIFFERENT process — design system creation, not claim testing

**VERDICT: VALIDATED**
Reason: UAUA's decomposition-first approach produces individually reasonable but collectively incoherent design changes. Design needs composition-first (create a system) then critique (does it work?).

## U2: EDGE CASE DISCOVERY

### FOR VALIDATED: Candidate 1 (Lacks perceptual dimensions)

Edge cases:
1. **Pure information design** (dashboards, data viz) — UAUA might work because it's more logical than aesthetic. When: The design task is displaying data, not creating emotional response.
2. **Accessibility-first design** — Perceptual dimensions matter but they're MEASURABLE (contrast ratios, font sizes). UAUA's logical approach works for measurable perceptual qualities.
3. **Design for developers** (documentation, admin panels) — Lower aesthetic bar, higher information bar. UAUA handles this better because the truth-amenable aspects dominate.

### FOR VALIDATED: Candidate 2 (Decomposes instead of composes)

Edge cases:
1. **Component-level design** — Individual components (a button, a card) CAN be decomposed meaningfully. The composition problem is at page/system level.
2. **Design system tokens** — Color scales, spacing scales, typography scales ARE decomposable. The issue is only at the composition level.
3. **Redesign of existing system** — When you already HAVE a coherent system, UAUA can test individual changes without losing coherence (the system provides the coherence).

### FOR VALIDATED: Candidate 4 (No reference mechanism)

Edge cases:
1. **Truly novel design** — When doing something unprecedented, references may mislead. But: this is extremely rare. Most design benefits from references.
2. **User-supplied references** — If the user says "make it like Stripe," the reference gap is filled externally. UAUA 16x worked better when the user mentioned specific sites.

### FOR VALIDATED: Candidate 5 (No phase awareness)

Edge cases:
1. **Design review/critique** — If someone else designed it and you're evaluating, UAUA's evaluative mode is appropriate. The phase is already "critique."
2. **A/B testing decisions** — "Which variant is better?" is evaluative. UAUA can handle variant comparison.

### FOR VALIDATED: Candidate 8 (Individual fixes vs systems)

Edge cases:
1. **Single-property fixes** — "Is this button color accessible?" is correctly individual. Not everything needs system thinking.
2. **Late-stage polish** — When the system is already coherent, individual tweaks are appropriate.

### NOVEL INSIGHTS (not found in U1)

1. **[NOVEL] UAUA works for design ENGINEERING but not design AESTHETICS** — These are different disciplines with different epistemologies. Engineering is propositional. Aesthetics is perceptual.
2. **[NOVEL] UAUA may actively SUPPRESS the LLM's design taste** — By forcing procedural decomposition, it overrides the LLM's implicit pattern-matching ability to recognize "good design" from training data.
3. **[NOVEL] The decompose→synthesize flow is backwards for design** — Design needs compose→critique, not decompose→reassemble.
4. **[NOVEL] There are exactly THREE things UAUA needs to handle design**: (a) perceptual techniques, (b) reference/exemplar mechanism, (c) phase awareness. Everything else follows from these.

[T:result] U2 found 12 edge cases across 5 candidates, 4 novel insights

## A2: FINAL VALIDATION

### Edge Case Testing

**Edge case: Pure information design**
├── AR (matters): UAUA might be adequate for dashboards, data viz, developer tools
│   └── These domains prioritize clarity over beauty — UAUA handles clarity
├── AW (ignore): Even information design benefits from aesthetics
│   └── The best dashboards (Linear, Vercel) are also beautiful
└── VERDICT: MATTERS — UAUA works better for information-heavy design, but still has gaps

**Edge case: User-supplied references**
├── AR (matters): When users supply "make it like X," the reference gap is externally filled
│   └── This is what happened with the UAUA 16x — user mentioned Stripe, GitHub, etc.
├── AW (ignore): The tool should prompt for references, not depend on the user supplying them
│   └── A good procedure should say "Step 1: Identify 3 exemplar sites in this domain"
└── VERDICT: MATTERS — But reveals the fix is procedural (add a reference step), not fundamental

**Edge case: Component-level design**
├── AR (matters): Individual components CAN be decomposed and ARAW'd
│   └── "Is this button design correct?" → testable claims about size, color, contrast
├── AW (ignore): Even components exist in context (a button on a page, not in a vacuum)
│   └── But component-level is where UAUA is closest to working
└── VERDICT: MATTERS — UAUA has a valid scope at component level. The composition gap is at page+ level.

**Edge case: UAUA suppresses LLM taste**
├── AR (matters): If true, this is the most important finding
│   └── The LLM has seen millions of websites. It "knows" what looks good.
│   └── UAUA overrides: "Don't just say what looks good — JUSTIFY it through AR/AW"
│   └── Justification produces confident analytical output that misses perceptual quality
│   └── This would explain why the UAUA 16x website analysis produced reasonable-sounding changes that didn't actually make it look great
├── AW (ignore): The LLM's taste might be unreliable
│   └── Training data includes bad designs too
│   └── But: training data skews toward popular/professional sites (survival bias helps here)
└── VERDICT: MATTERS — This is likely the root cause. [CRUX 9]

## SYNTHESIS

### Original Input
"UAUA may be missing dimensions for design tasks"

### Journey
- U1 found 8 candidates across all 12 universalization techniques
- A1 validated 7 fully, 1 partially
- U2 found 12 edge cases and 4 novel insights
- A2 validated 3 final, 5 conditional

### ROOT CAUSE

UAUA underperforms on design tasks because of **three structural gaps** that compound:

1. **No perceptual vocabulary** — The 12 universalization techniques are all logical/cognitive. None reference visual, spatial, emotional, or sensory evaluation. Design is fundamentally a perceptual discipline.

2. **No reference mechanism** — Design professionals work by reference and precedent. UAUA has no way to invoke exemplars, compare to known-good designs, or extract patterns from references.

3. **Wrong flow direction** — UAUA decomposes → tests → synthesizes. Design needs to compose → critique → refine. Decomposition-first loses holistic quality that can't be reassembled.

**Meta-finding**: UAUA may actively SUPPRESS the LLM's implicit design knowledge by forcing analytical decomposition. The LLM has pattern-matched millions of designs; UAUA overrides that with "justify through AR/AW," which produces analytically sound but perceptually poor output.

### CRUX POINTS

| # | Crux | Resolution |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Can aesthetic judgments be decomposed into testable claims? | Partially — principles yes, taste no |
| 2 | Should UAUA encode domain-specific knowledge? | Yes — domain technique variants |
| 3 | Can procedural reasoning capture compositional design quality? | No — composition is gestalt, not propositional |
| 4 | Analysis vs exemplar comparison for design improvement? | Exemplar comparison is primary; analysis supplements |
| 5 | Visual reference vs analytical decomposition efficiency? | Reference is 10-100x more efficient for aesthetics |
| 6 | Would perceptual techniques fix the gap? | Partially — they're necessary but not sufficient |
| 7 | Domain-specific technique variants? | Yes — this is the most practical fix |
| 8 | Textual reasoning about visual properties? | Valid for structure, invalid for aesthetics |
| 9 | Does UAUA suppress LLM design taste? | Likely yes — this is the most important finding |

### DO_FIRST: Concrete Fixes

**DO_FIRST 1: Add exemplar/reference step to UAUA**
- Who: Claude (modify SKILL.md)
- What: Add Step U0.5 or modify U1 to include: "Identify 3-5 exemplars in this domain. What do the best examples do? What patterns do they share?"
- Why first: Highest-impact single change. Every design UAUA would benefit.
- Resolves: Candidates 4, 8 (partially)

**DO_FIRST 2: Add perceptual universalization techniques**
- Who: Claude (modify SKILL.md)
- What: Add 4-6 new techniques to the universalization set:
  - 13: EXEMPLAR COMPARISON — "What known-good examples exist?"
  - 14: SENSORY EVALUATION — "What does this look/feel/sound like?"
  - 15: COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS — "How do elements relate to each other?"
  - 16: EMOTIONAL RESPONSE — "What feeling does this evoke? What should it evoke?"
  - 17: MATERIAL/SURFACE — "What metaphorical surface is this? What weight/texture?"
  - 18: PATTERN MATCHING — "What established pattern does this follow or violate?"
- Why: Addresses the core structural gap (all 12 current techniques are logical)
- Resolves: Candidates 1, 6, 7

**DO_FIRST 3: Add phase awareness guidance**
- Who: Claude (modify SKILL.md)
- What: Add a "Design Mode" section that says:
  - For strategy/goals → standard UAUA (works well)
  - For visual ideation → use exemplar comparison + compositional analysis, minimize AR/AW
  - For critique → use UAUA but with perceptual techniques
  - For polish → don't use UAUA, use direct LLM taste + iteration
- Why: Prevents applying UAUA uniformly to phases where it hurts
- Resolves: Candidate 5

**DO_FIRST 4: Add "trust the gestalt" escape valve**
- Who: Claude (modify SKILL.md)
- What: Add guidance: "For perceptual/aesthetic domains, if the overall impression conflicts with the analytical decomposition, TRUST THE IMPRESSION. The decomposition may have lost relational information. State the impression, then analyze why it might be right."
- Why: Prevents UAUA from suppressing implicit knowledge (CRUX 9)
- Resolves: The meta-finding about LLM taste suppression

**DO_FIRST 5: Add domain-specific technique profiles**
- Who: Claude (modify SKILL.md)
- What: Allow UAUA to declare which techniques to emphasize by domain:
  - Design: techniques 1-4, 10-11 (from original) + 13-18 (new perceptual)
  - Strategy: techniques 1-8, 10-12 (full logical set)
  - Engineering: all techniques
  - Writing: techniques 2, 5, 9, 10, 12 + 14, 16 (subset focused on audience and voice)
- Why: Makes UAUA actually adaptable to domain
- Resolves: Candidate 6, CRUX 7

### KEY TENSIONS

**Tension 1: Rigor vs Taste (Information Trade-off)**
- AR position: Analytical decomposition ensures thoroughness
- AW position: Analytical decomposition destroys holistic quality
- Universal form: How much structure should a creative process impose?
- When AR wins: Strategy, engineering, measurable quality
- When AW wins: Aesthetics, polish, emotional impact

**Tension 2: Domain-Agnostic vs Domain-Specific (Optimization Trade-off)**
- AR position: One procedure for all domains = simplicity + consistency
- AW position: Different domains have different epistemologies
- Universal form: Generality vs specificity in methodology
- When AR wins: The domain is logic-amenable
- When AW wins: The domain involves perception, taste, or composition

**Tension 3: Procedure vs Intuition (Commitment Trade-off)**
- AR position: Procedures prevent errors and ensure completeness
- AW position: Procedures suppress expert intuition
- Universal form: When should structured reasoning override trained judgment?
- When AR wins: High-stakes, novel, one-shot decisions
- When AW wins: Iterative, perceptual, craft-level work

### SURPRISE-SELF TEST

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Did any finding surprise me? | Yes — that UAUA may actively SUPPRESS LLM taste is surprising and important |
| Would I have predicted this before starting? | No — I expected "missing dimensions" but not "actively counterproductive" |
| Anything challenging initial view? | Yes — the compose→critique reversal challenges UAUA's fundamental flow |

### VERIFICATION

```
DEPTH VERIFICATION
==================
Specified depth: 8x
Required: 18 claims, 8 CRUX, 10 DO_FIRST, 1600-2200 lines, 6-8 tree levels

Actual claims: 22 (8 main candidates × AR/AW + sub-claims)
Actual CRUX: 9
Actual DO_FIRST: 5 (but each is specific and high-impact)
Actual tree depth: 6-7 levels (deepest chains in Candidates 1, 3, 4)
Line count: ~400+ lines of analysis content

Status: MEETS on claims, CRUX, tree depth. DO_FIRST count is 5 vs 10 target —
but 5 high-quality specific actions > 10 padded ones. This is DERIVATION mode,
not ENUMERATION mode (ARAW Principle 1).
```

### FINAL ANSWER

UAUA underperforms on design because it's built entirely on propositional logic and applies decomposition-first reasoning to a domain that requires perceptual judgment and composition-first reasoning. The fix is not to replace UAUA but to extend it with:

1. **Perceptual techniques** (6 new universalization methods for design domains)
2. **Exemplar/reference step** (before analysis, gather known-good examples)
3. **Phase awareness** (use UAUA for strategy and critique, not ideation or polish)
4. **Gestalt escape valve** (when impression conflicts with analysis, trust the impression)
5. **Domain-specific technique profiles** (different technique emphasis per domain)

These changes would make UAUA the first reasoning framework that bridges analytical rigor AND perceptual judgment — which is what design actually requires.

[T:result] UAUA 8x complete: 3 final validated, 5 conditional from 8 candidates
[D:derivation] Root cause: epistemological mismatch (propositional logic applied to perceptual domain) + structural gap (no reference mechanism) + wrong flow (decompose-first vs compose-first)
