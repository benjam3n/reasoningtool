# DCP — Enhancing Human Intelligence Through Technology and Biotechnology (Practical, Limited Resources)

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: methods of enhancing human intelligence through technology and biotechnology practically with limited resources

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

What dimensions determine which intelligence enhancement method to pursue?

| # | Dimension | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Enhancement Target** | Which cognitive capacity are you trying to improve? (working memory, processing speed, executive function, creativity, knowledge acquisition, emotional regulation) | Different targets require completely different interventions. "Intelligence" is not one thing. |
| 2 | **Time to Effect** | How quickly do you need results? (hours, weeks, months, years) | Pharmacological acts in hours; skill training takes months; genetic approaches are generational. |
| 3 | **Budget** | What can you spend monthly? ($0, <$50, <$200, <$1000, >$1000) | Eliminates most biotech interventions immediately. Determines whether you're in lifestyle/software or pharmaceutical/device territory. |
| 4 | **Risk Tolerance** | What side effects or unknowns are acceptable? (none, minor/reversible, moderate, significant) | The most effective interventions often carry the most uncertainty. Nootropics vs. sleep optimization have very different risk profiles. |
| 5 | **Reversibility** | Must the intervention be stoppable/reversible? | Supplements can be stopped; brain-computer interfaces cannot be easily removed; gene editing is permanent. |
| 6 | **Evidence Quality Required** | Do you need RCT-level evidence, or will plausible mechanism + anecdote suffice? | Most "intelligence enhancement" claims have weak evidence. Your standard determines your option space. |
| 7 | **Legal/Regulatory Status** | What's legal and accessible in your jurisdiction? | Modafinil is prescription in most countries; microdosing is illegal in most; tDCS devices are unregulated consumer products. |
| 8 | **Baseline State** | Are you currently impaired (sleep-deprived, depressed, ADHD) or optimizing from a healthy baseline? | Fixing impairment produces 10-50x larger gains than optimizing from baseline. This changes everything. |
| 9 | **Sustainability** | One-time boost or permanent ongoing enhancement? | Stimulants provide temporary boosts with tolerance; deliberate practice creates permanent neural changes. |
| 10 | **Implementation Complexity** | Can you just take a pill, or does this require lifestyle restructuring, equipment, medical supervision? | Limited resources usually means limited support infrastructure too. |
| 11 | **Interaction Effects** | Are you already using other interventions? What combinations are safe? | Stacking nootropics, stimulants, and sleep changes without understanding interactions is dangerous. |
| 12 | **Measurement Capability** | Can you actually measure whether this is working? | Without measurement, you're guessing. Subjective "I feel smarter" is unreliable. |

### Category C: Pharmacological ($20-200/month, often prescription/grey market)

| Intervention | Target | Evidence | Time to Effect | Risk |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------|------|
| Modafinil/armodafinil | Wakefulness, executive function | Strong (FDA-approved for narcolepsy; off-label cognitive use well-studied) | 1-2 hours | Moderate (headache, insomnia, rare SJS) |
| Methylphenidate/amphetamine (Rx) | Attention, working memory (especially if ADHD) | Strong (if diagnosed ADHD) | 30-60 minutes | Moderate (cardiovascular, dependence) |

### Category D: Technology & Devices ($50-1000+)

| Intervention | Target | Evidence | Time to Effect | Risk |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------|------|
| AI cognitive assistants (ChatGPT, etc.) | Effective intelligence (offloading tasks) | N/A (tool, not enhancement) | Immediate | None (dependency concern) |
| tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) | Varies by montage: working memory, learning rate | Weak-moderate (results variable, hard to replicate) | During/after session | Low-moderate (burns, unknown long-term) |
| Neurofeedback (EEG-based) | Attention, relaxation | Weak-moderate (better for ADHD than general enhancement) | Weeks-months (many sessions) | Low |

| Second brain / PKM systems (Obsidian, Notion) | External memory, idea connection | N/A (tool) | Immediate | None |
| HRV biofeedback | Stress regulation, decision-making under pressure | Moderate | Weeks | None |

### Category E: Biotech / Frontier ($1000+, limited access)

| Intervention | Target | Evidence | Time to Effect | Risk |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------|------|
| Genetic testing + personalized protocol | Identify deficiencies, pharmacogenomics | Moderate (for deficiency identification) | Weeks | Low |
| TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) | Depression, specific cognitive targets | Moderate (FDA-approved for depression) | Weeks | Low-moderate |
| Peptides (semax, selank, BPC-157) | Neuroprotection, BDNF (claimed) | Weak (mostly animal/in-vitro) | Days-weeks | Moderate (unregulated) |
| Brain-computer interfaces (consumer EEG) | Neurofeedback, attention training | Weak (consumer devices limited) | Months | Low |

---

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

| # | Hidden Assumption | Why It's Dangerous |
|---|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **"Intelligence is one thing you can increase"** | Intelligence is many capacities. Improving working memory won't help if your bottleneck is domain knowledge or emotional regulation. You must diagnose your actual bottleneck first. |
| 2 | **"Enhancement means adding something new"** | The largest gains come from *removing impairments* (sleep debt, nutritional deficiency, untreated ADHD, depression). Removal > addition for 90% of people. |
| 3 | **"More interventions = more enhancement"** | Stacking produces diminishing returns and interaction risks. Three well-chosen interventions beat fifteen random ones. |
| 4 | **"If I feel smarter, I am smarter"** | Stimulants and nootropics reliably increase subjective confidence without reliably increasing actual performance. Measurement is essential. |
| 5 | **"The cutting-edge stuff works best"** | Sleep, exercise, and deliberate practice have stronger evidence than any nootropic or device. The boring stuff works; the exciting stuff mostly doesn't. |
| 6 | **"Limited resources means I can't do much"** | The most effective interventions (sleep, exercise, spaced repetition, AI tools) are free or nearly free. Money mostly buys convenience, not effectiveness. |
| 7 | **"Enhancement is about the individual brain"** | Using AI assistants, external memory systems, and better information tools increases *effective* intelligence more than any brain intervention. The best enhancement might be a tool, not a pill. |
| 8 | **"I should optimize for peak performance"** | Consistency beats peaks. A reliable 10% improvement every day beats a 50% improvement once a week with crashes between. |

## Step 4: The Procedure (`/stg`)

```
================================================================
INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT: SELECTION & IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE
(For practical use with limited resources)
================================================================

STEP 0: WHAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPROVE?

  Pick the ONE statement that best describes your situation:

  A) "I can't focus or think clearly most days"
     → Go to SECTION A (Fix Impairments First)

  B) "I'm functional but want to learn faster and retain more"
     → Go to SECTION B (Learning Enhancement)

  C) "I need to perform better at demanding cognitive work"
     → Go to SECTION C (Performance Enhancement)

  D) "I want to be more creative / generate better ideas"
     → Go to SECTION D (Creativity Enhancement)

  E) "I want to get more done with the same brain"
     → Go to SECTION E (Cognitive Offloading / Tools)

  If more than one applies, ALWAYS start with A if it's
  one of them. Impairment removal comes before optimization.

================================================================
SECTION A: FIX IMPAIRMENTS FIRST
(Cost: $0-50/month | Expected gain: 20-50% cognitive improvement)
================================================================

  This section exists because MOST people seeking intelligence
  enhancement are actually impaired and don't know it. Fixing
  impairment gives 10-50x the gains of any supplement or device.

  Step A1: SLEEP CHECK
    → Are you getting 7-9 hours of sleep, at consistent times,
      at least 5 of 7 nights?
      NO → STOP. Fix this first. Nothing else will work on
           top of sleep debt. Actions:
           - Fixed wake time (same every day, including weekends)
           - No screens 1hr before bed
           - No caffeine after noon
           - Dark, cool room
           - Do this for 14 days, then return to STEP 0
      YES → Go to Step A2

  Step A2: DEFICIENCY SCREEN
    → Have you had blood work in the last 12 months checking:
      Vitamin D, B12, iron/ferritin, thyroid (TSH)?
      NO → Get blood work done. If you can't afford a doctor,
           many direct-to-consumer labs cost $50-100.
           Common cognitive-impairing deficiencies:
           - Vitamin D < 30 ng/mL (very common)
           - B12 < 400 pg/mL
           - Ferritin < 30 ng/mL (especially in women)
           - TSH > 4.0 or < 0.4
           Fix any deficiencies found. Return in 8 weeks.
      YES, all normal → Go to Step A3
      YES, found deficiency → Supplement for 8 weeks, retest,
                              then return to STEP 0

  Step A3: MENTAL HEALTH CHECK
    → Do any of these apply?
      - Persistent low mood or anxiety most days
      - Difficulty concentrating that's been present since
        childhood (possible undiagnosed ADHD)
      - Brain fog that doesn't resolve with sleep
      NO → You're probably not impaired. Go to STEP 0 and
           pick B, C, D, or E.
      YES → See a healthcare provider. Treating depression
            improves cognition more than any nootropic.
            Diagnosing ADHD opens access to the strongest
            cognitive enhancers available (stimulant Rx).
            Return after treatment starts.

  Step A4: EXERCISE CHECK
    → Are you doing 150+ min/week of aerobic exercise
      (heart rate elevated, breathing hard)?
      NO → Add this. Walking counts if it's brisk.
           This is the single most evidence-backed cognitive
           enhancer. Increases BDNF (brain-derived
           neurotrophic factor), hippocampal volume, and
           executive function.
           Do this for 4 weeks, then return to STEP 0.
      YES → You've addressed the major impairments.
            Return to STEP 0, pick B/C/D/E.

================================================================
SECTION B: LEARNING ENHANCEMENT
(You want to learn faster and retain more)
================================================================

  Step B1: INSTALL SPACED REPETITION
    → Do you currently use Anki or an equivalent SRS?
      YES → Go to Step B2
      NO  → Download Anki (free). For whatever you're
            learning, create cards as you learn. Rules:
            - One fact per card
            - Use cloze deletions (fill-in-the-blank)
            - Review every day (this is non-negotiable)
            - Start with 10-20 new cards/day max
            This alone will 2-5x your retention of new
            material. Use for 30 days, then go to Step B2.

  Step B2: OPTIMIZE ENCODING
    → When you study/learn, which best describes your method?
      a) Re-reading or highlighting → This barely works.
         Switch to: active recall (close the book, write what
         you remember), interleaving (mix topics), and
         elaboration (explain it to an imaginary student).
      b) Already using active recall → Go to Step B3
    → Practice the new method for 2 weeks, then Step B3.

  Step B3: ADD ONE SUPPLEMENT (optional)
    → Budget check: Can you spend $15-30/month?
      NO  → Skip to Step B4. The free methods above are
            more effective than any supplement anyway.
      YES → Choose ONE (not multiple):
            OPTION 1: Creatine monohydrate (5g/day)
              - Best evidence for cognitive benefit in
                vegetarians and under sleep pressure
              - Cost: ~$10/month
              - Risk: very low (bloating initially)
            OPTION 2: Bacopa monnieri (300mg/day, standardized)
              - Evidence for memory encoding improvement
              - Takes 8-12 weeks to show effect
              - Cost: ~$15/month
              - Risk: low (some GI discomfort)
            → Take your chosen supplement for 8-12 weeks.
              Measure (see Step B4) before and after.

  Step B4: MEASURE
    → Pick ONE cognitive benchmark relevant to your learning:
      - Anki retention rate (Anki tracks this automatically)
      - Time to learn a defined unit of material
      - Score on practice tests in your domain
    → Record baseline BEFORE starting any new intervention.
    → Re-measure after 30-60 days.
    → Did the metric improve by >10%?
      YES → Keep the intervention. Add another from Section B
            or move to another section.
      NO  → Drop it. Try the next option or accept that
            you've optimized this dimension.

================================================================
SECTION C: PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT
(You need to perform better at demanding cognitive work)
================================================================

  Step C1: IDENTIFY YOUR PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECK
    → Which ONE is your biggest problem during demanding work?
      a) Can't sustain attention for long periods
         → Go to Step C2 (Attention interventions)
      b) Working memory feels overloaded (can't hold enough
         in mind at once)
         → Go to Step C3 (Working memory interventions)
      c) Mental fatigue / cognitive endurance
         → Go to Step C4 (Endurance interventions)
      d) Decision fatigue / executive function
         → Go to Step C5 (Executive function interventions)

  Step C2: ATTENTION
    → Budget: Can you spend $0-30/month?
      TIER 1 ($0): Meditation — focused attention style.
        Start with 10 min/day (use Waking Up app free trial
        or YouTube). Increase to 20min over 4 weeks.
        Improves sustained attention in 4-8 weeks.
      TIER 2 ($5-10): Caffeine + L-theanine stack.
        100mg caffeine + 200mg L-theanine. Take as needed
        (not daily — tolerance builds). Provides 3-5 hours
        of calm focus. Cost: ~$0.10-0.30 per dose.
      TIER 3 ($30+): If these don't help AND you suspect
        ADHD → see Step A3 (get evaluated). Prescription
        stimulants for actual ADHD are the strongest
        attention enhancers known.
    → Pick ONE tier. Try for 30 days. Measure with a
      focus time tracker (Toggl, simple stopwatch).

  Step C3: WORKING MEMORY
    → TIER 1 ($0): External working memory — write
      everything down. Use scratch paper, whiteboards,
      or digital notes to offload. This isn't cheating;
      it's how experts actually work.
    → TIER 2 ($0): Dual n-back training (20 min/day).
      Free apps available. Evidence is contested but some
      studies show transfer. Try for 4 weeks.
    → TIER 3 ($10): Creatine (5g/day) — modest evidence
      for working memory under cognitive load.
    → Pick ONE. Try for 30 days. Measure with n-back
      scores or self-rated task difficulty.

  Step C4: COGNITIVE ENDURANCE
    → TIER 1 ($0): Structured work blocks.
      Work 50 min, break 10 min. During breaks: move,
      don't scroll. Most people aren't actually fatigued;
      they're poorly structured.
    → TIER 2 ($0): Aerobic exercise. 30 min before
      demanding work increases cognitive endurance for
      the session. The most underused performance hack.
    → TIER 3 ($30-100): Modafinil (if legally accessible).
      100-200mg in the morning. Extends cognitive endurance
      significantly. Prescription in most countries.
      DO NOT use more than 2-3x/week (tolerance).
      DO NOT use as a sleep replacement.
    → Pick ONE tier. Try for 2 weeks.

  Step C5: EXECUTIVE FUNCTION / DECISION FATIGUE
    → TIER 1 ($0): Pre-decide. Reduce daily decisions:
      same breakfast, same morning routine, decide tomorrow's
      priorities tonight. Save decision capacity for work.
    → TIER 2 ($0): Morning-load. Do your most demanding
      cognitive work in the first 2-4 hours after waking.
      Executive function degrades through the day.
    → TIER 3 ($0-free): AI assistants for decision support.
      Use ChatGPT/Claude to structure complex decisions,
      generate options, and evaluate tradeoffs. This is
      executive function augmentation via tool.

================================================================
SECTION D: CREATIVITY ENHANCEMENT
================================================================

  Step D1: DIVERSIFY INPUTS
    → Are you consuming information from more than 3
      unrelated domains regularly?
      NO → Add 2 domains far from your expertise.
           Read/watch/listen 30 min/week each.
           Creativity = remote associations across domains.
           Novel combinations require novel inputs.
      YES → Go to Step D2

  Step D2: CREATE COLLISION OPPORTUNITIES
    → Do you have a regular practice that forces idea
      connection? (journaling, mind mapping, walking
      without phone, structured brainstorming)
      NO → Pick one:
           - Morning pages (20 min freewriting on waking)
           - Weekly "connection session" (pick 2 random
             ideas from different domains, force a link)
           - Daily phoneless walk (20+ min)
      YES → Go to Step D3

  Step D3: OPTIONAL PHARMACOLOGICAL
    → Evidence for creativity-enhancing substances is
      WEAK. The strongest signals (not strong in absolute
      terms) are:
      - Moderate caffeine (improves convergent thinking,
        may impair divergent — use for execution, not
        ideation)
      - Microdosing psychedelics — controlled studies show
        minimal effect despite strong anecdotal reports.
        LEGAL RISK in most jurisdictions. NOT RECOMMENDED
        as a first-line approach.
    → The behavioral interventions in D1-D2 have better
      evidence than any substance for creativity.

================================================================
SECTION E: COGNITIVE OFFLOADING / TOOLS
(Enhance effective intelligence via external systems)
================================================================

  Step E1: AI ASSISTANT INTEGRATION
    → Are you using AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for:
      - Drafting and editing text
      - Research and synthesis
      - Code generation
      - Decision structuring
      - Learning explanations
      NO → Start. This is the single largest practical
           intelligence multiplier currently available.
           Cost: $0-20/month. Effect: immediate.
           Start with ONE workflow you do repeatedly
           and build an AI-assisted version.
      YES → Go to Step E2

  Step E2: EXTERNAL MEMORY SYSTEM
    → Do you have a system for storing and retrieving
      your own notes, ideas, and knowledge?
      NO → Pick ONE:
           - Obsidian (free, local, graph-based)
           - Notion (free tier, structured)
           - Physical notebook with index
           Rule: if you think it, write it down. If it's
           important, file it where you'll find it again.
      YES → Go to Step E3

  Step E3: AUTOMATION
    → List 5 cognitive tasks you do repeatedly.
      For each: could a script, template, checklist, or
      AI workflow do 80% of this?
      → Automate the top 2. Reclaim that cognitive energy
        for work that actually requires your brain.

================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
================================================================

THE ENHANCEMENT PYRAMID (strongest evidence at bottom):

  Layer 5: Frontier biotech (BCI, gene therapy) — speculative
  Layer 4: Pharmacological (modafinil, Rx stimulants) — effective
           but risk/access limited
  Layer 3: Supplements (creatine, bacopa, caffeine+theanine) —
           modest, safe
  Layer 2: Tools (AI assistants, SRS, PKM systems) — large
           practical effect, free/cheap
  Layer 1: Foundations (sleep, exercise, nutrition, mental
           health) — LARGEST EFFECT, free

  ALWAYS build from the bottom up. Never skip layers.

BEST BANG FOR BUCK (limited resources):
  $0/month:  Sleep + exercise + spaced repetition + AI tools
  $20/month: Add creatine + caffeine/theanine + AI subscription
  $50/month: Add bacopa + Obsidian sync + meditation app
  $200/month: Add modafinil (if accessible) + genetic testing

THE MEASUREMENT RULE:
  If you can't measure whether it's working, don't spend
  money on it. Subjective "I feel sharper" is not measurement.

================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES
================================================================

1. SKIPPING SECTION A. You're not baseline-impaired? Are you
   sure? Most people underestimate how much sleep debt,
   deficiency, or untreated conditions cost them. Get blood
   work. Track sleep. Be certain before moving on.

2. STACKING TOO MANY SUPPLEMENTS. If you start 5 things at
   once, you can't know what's working. Start ONE, measure
   for 30-60 days, then add another.

3. CHASING NOOTROPICS WHILE NEGLECTING EXERCISE. Exercise has
   stronger cognitive evidence than ANY supplement. If you're
   taking racetams but not exercising, you've got it backwards.

4. CONFUSING STIMULATION WITH ENHANCEMENT. Caffeine and
   modafinil make you feel sharper. They reliably improve
   some metrics. But they don't build lasting capacity.
   Combine with methods that do (deliberate practice, SRS).

5. IGNORING TOOLS. Using AI assistants effectively is the
   highest-ROI intelligence enhancement available today.
   It's not "cheating" — it's extending your cognitive
   capacity, which is the entire point.

6. EXPECTING DRAMATIC RESULTS. Realistic gains from any
   single intervention (except fixing a deficiency or
   treating ADHD): 5-15% on relevant metrics. The power
   is in stacking several 5-15% gains on a solid foundation.

7. NOT MEASURING. "I think I'm thinking better" is how
   every placebo feels. Use Anki stats, timed tests,
   work output metrics, or standardized cognitive tests
   (Cambridge Brain Sciences is free).

================================================================
WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE
================================================================

- If a doctor or psychiatrist recommends a specific
  intervention → follow their advice over this procedure.
- If you have epilepsy, cardiac conditions, or are pregnant →
  consult a doctor before ANY supplement or device. Several
  interventions listed here are contraindicated.
- If you're under 25 → your brain is still developing.
  Stick to Section A (foundations) and Section E (tools).
  Avoid pharmacological interventions except under
  medical supervision.
- If cost of any intervention means you can't eat or pay
  rent → the stress of financial instability impairs
  cognition more than any supplement helps. Fix finances
  first.

================================================================
WORKED EXAMPLES
================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: "College student, no money, wants to study better"
  → STEP 0: Picks B (learning enhancement)
  → But wait — check A first. A1: sleeping 5-6hrs → FIX SLEEP
  → 14 days later, re-triage → still B
  → B1: Installs Anki, starts making cards for classes
  → B2: Switches from re-reading to active recall
  → B3: Budget = $0, skips supplements
  → B4: Measures Anki retention rate (85% → 92% after 30 days)
  → Moves to E1: starts using ChatGPT for study explanations
