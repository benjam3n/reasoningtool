# Decision Procedure — How to Turn Knowledge Into Action

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Skill**: /dcp (Decision Procedure)
**Input**: continue with what is logically next (third in sequence after "how to ask the wrong question" and "how learning happens and how it can be accelerated")

---

## Step 1: Discover Decision Dimensions (`/dd`)

The recurring decision: **"I know what I should do. Why am I not doing it, and what's the fastest path from understanding to execution?"**

This is the knowing-doing gap — the most common failure mode after learning. People finish courses, read books, develop plans, and then... nothing happens.

### Dimensions that determine whether knowledge converts into action:

1. **Action Clarity** — Can you describe the *very first physical action* you'd take? Not "implement the strategy" but "open the file, type this line." Vague actions don't get done.

2. **Activation Energy** — How much effort does starting require? Some actions need 5 seconds of setup (send an email). Others need 5 hours (configure a development environment). High activation energy kills action regardless of motivation.

3. **Reversibility** — Can you undo it if it goes wrong? Reversible actions (send a draft for review) have low psychological resistance. Irreversible actions (quit your job) create paralysis even when you know they're right.

4. **Dependencies** — Does this action require something else to happen first? Actions with unresolved dependencies sit on todo lists forever. You're not procrastinating — you're blocked and haven't identified the blocker.

5. **Identity Alignment** — Does this action fit who you believe you are? "I should cold-call prospects" fails when your self-concept is "I'm not a salesperson." The action competes with identity, and identity always wins.

6. **Feedback Latency** — How long until you know if the action worked? Actions with immediate feedback (code compiles or doesn't) are easy to sustain. Actions with 6-month feedback (diet, investing, relationship changes) require different sustaining mechanisms.

7. **Social Visibility** — Will anyone see you do this? Social visibility can be an accelerator (accountability) or a blocker (fear of looking foolish). The effect depends on the person and context.

8. **Cognitive Load at Execution** — How much thinking is required during the action itself? If you have to make judgment calls while executing, each call is a potential stopping point. Pre-deciding eliminates in-action decision fatigue.

9. **Competing Commitments** — What existing obligations conflict with this action? "I know I should exercise" competes with "I'm exhausted after work." The competing commitment is usually invisible and always wins until surfaced.

10. **Emotional Barrier** — What feeling does the action trigger? Fear, shame, boredom, anxiety? The emotion is usually not about the action itself but about what the action *means* (failure, rejection, vulnerability).

11. **Progress Visibility** — Can you see yourself making progress? Actions where progress is visible (word count, miles run, features shipped) sustain themselves. Actions where progress is invisible (networking, learning, culture change) require artificial progress markers.

12. **Environmental Support** — Does your physical/digital environment make this action easy or hard? If the action requires willpower to initiate every time, the environment is fighting you.

## Step 2: Enumerate Options per Dimension (`/se`)

| Dimension | Possible States |
|---|---|
| **Action Clarity** | Crystal clear first step / Clear goal but vague steps / "I know what to do" (but can't describe it physically) / No idea where to start |
| **Activation Energy** | Trivial (< 2 min to start) / Low (2-30 min setup) / Medium (30 min - 2 hrs setup) / High (half-day+ before you can begin) |
| **Reversibility** | Fully reversible / Mostly reversible with some cost / Partially reversible / Irreversible |
| **Dependencies** | No dependencies / Dependencies identified and resolved / Dependencies identified but unresolved / Hidden dependencies |
| **Identity Alignment** | "This is who I am" / Neutral / "This isn't really me" / Actively conflicts with self-image |
| **Feedback Latency** | Immediate (seconds-minutes) / Short (days) / Medium (weeks-months) / Long (months-years) / None (no way to measure) |
| **Social Visibility** | Private / Small audience / Public / High-stakes audience |
| **Cognitive Load** | Mechanical (follow the steps) / Some judgment needed / Constant judgment calls / Requires real-time improvisation |
| **Competing Commitments** | No conflicts / Minor conflicts / Major conflict with one commitment / Conflicts with core life structure |
| **Emotional Barrier** | None / Mild discomfort / Significant fear or anxiety / Existential dread |
| **Progress Visibility** | Naturally visible / Can be made visible with tracking / Invisible but inferable / Truly invisible |
| **Environmental Support** | Environment enables action / Neutral / Environment creates friction / Environment actively prevents action |

**Key interactions**:
- If Action Clarity = vague AND Activation Energy = high → near-zero probability of starting. Fix clarity first.
- If Identity Alignment = conflicts AND Emotional Barrier = significant → this isn't a productivity problem, it's a values conflict. No amount of "just do it" helps.
- If Competing Commitments = major AND the person hasn't identified them → they'll blame willpower for what is actually a structural conflict.
- If Feedback Latency = long AND Progress Visibility = invisible → abandonment is almost certain without artificial milestones.

---

## Step 3: Surface Hidden Assumptions (`/aex`)

What does "just do it" advice assume that's wrong?

1. **"Knowing what to do is the hard part"** — For most meaningful actions, knowing is 10% and doing is 90%. Yet people invest 90% of their time in learning and planning and 10% in executing. The bottleneck is almost never knowledge.

2. **"Motivation precedes action"** — Research consistently shows the opposite: action precedes motivation. You don't feel like running, then run. You start running, and motivation catches up around minute 8. Waiting for motivation is waiting for something that only arrives *after* you start.

3. **"The problem is laziness or willpower"** — Willpower is a post-hoc narrative. What looks like laziness is usually: unclear next step, high activation energy, unresolved dependency, competing commitment, or emotional barrier. Labeling it "laziness" prevents diagnosis.

4. **"Big actions require big motivation"** — The most effective path to big results is small actions repeated consistently. "Write for 2 hours" fails. "Write one sentence" succeeds and usually becomes 20 minutes because starting is the hard part, not continuing.

5. **"Planning is progress"** — Planning feels productive because it engages the same brain circuits as doing. But plans that don't convert to action within 48 hours have a near-zero execution rate. Planning beyond the immediate next action is usually sophisticated procrastination.

6. **"You need to feel ready"** — Readiness is not a feeling — it's a decision. If you have sufficient knowledge (not complete knowledge), you are ready. "I don't feel ready" usually means "I'm afraid of failing," which is about emotional barriers, not readiness.

7. **"Perfectionism is about high standards"** — Perfectionism is about avoiding judgment. The perfectionist doesn't act because any output can be criticized, and not-acting can't be. The cure isn't "lower your standards" — it's "separate your worth from your output."

8. **"If the action were right, it would feel easier"** — Important actions feel hard precisely because they matter. If an action feels easy and comfortable, it's probably not changing anything meaningful. Difficulty is a signal of significance, not wrongness.

## Step 4: The Procedure (`/stg`)

```
KNOWLEDGE-TO-ACTION PROCEDURE
================================

WHO THIS IS FOR: Anyone who knows what they should do but
isn't doing it. Works for single actions ("send that email")
and ongoing behaviors ("exercise regularly").

YOU WILL NEED: A clear description of what you're not doing.
If you don't know what to do yet, use the Learning Acceleration
Procedure first — this one assumes you already have the knowledge.
```

### STEP 0: What kind of inaction are you experiencing?

Write down the action you're not taking. Then classify:

| Your situation looks like... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| "I know the exact action but keep not doing it" | SECTION A (Blocked Action) |
| "I know the goal but not the specific next step" | SECTION B (Unclear Path) |
| "I keep starting but can't sustain it" | SECTION C (Abandoned Action) |
| "I'm doing things, but not the right things" | SECTION D (Displacement Activity) |
| "I don't know why I'm stuck" | SECTION E (Diagnosis) |

---

### SECTION A: Blocked Action — "I know what to do but can't make myself do it"

**Step A1: Shrink the action until it's laughably small.**
- Whatever you think the action is, make it smaller.
- "Write the report" → "Write one paragraph" → "Write one sentence" → "Open the document"
- Keep shrinking until you hit an action you could do RIGHT NOW in under 2 minutes.
- **What you should see**: An action so small it feels ridiculous to not do it.

**Step A2: Do the shrunken action. Right now. Before reading the next step.**
- Seriously. Do it. Then come back.
- Did you do it?
  - YES → Go to Step A3.
  - NO, and the reason is logistical (not at my computer, etc.) → Schedule a specific time within 24 hours. Write it down. Set an alarm. Go to Step A3 at that time.
  - NO, and I felt resistance even for the tiny action → **Your blocker is emotional, not practical.** Go to SECTION E, Step E3.

**Step A3: Now do the next-smallest increment.**
- Don't plan the whole sequence. Just do the next small piece.
- After each piece, ask: "Can I do one more small piece?"
  - YES → Do it.
  - NO, I'm done for now → That's fine. Write down exactly where you stopped and what the next tiny action is. Schedule when you'll do it.
- **What you should see**: More progress in 20 minutes of tiny steps than in weeks of planning.

**Step A4: After you've started, build a trigger.**
- A trigger is an existing daily event that you attach the action to.
- Formula: "After I [thing I already do every day], I will [small version of the action]."
- Examples: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write one paragraph." "After I close my laptop at end of day, I will send one outreach email."
- **What you should see**: A specific trigger written down, connected to a specific tiny action.

→ Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION B: Unclear Path — "I know the goal but not the next step"

**Step B1: Write down the goal. Then answer: "What would be true the moment BEFORE the goal is achieved?"**
- Not the end state — the state one step before the end.
- Example: Goal = "Launch the product." One step before = "Product is deployed and tested."
- **What you should see**: A concrete pre-condition.

**Step B2: Keep going backward. What would be true the moment before THAT?**
- Repeat until you arrive at something that IS ALREADY TRUE right now.
- **What you should see**: A chain of states from "now" to "goal achieved."

**Step B3: Find the first gap — the transition from a true state to a not-yet-true state.**
- That transition is your actual next action.
- If that transition is still too big, break IT down using the same backward technique.
- **What you should see**: A single, concrete action you can take today.

**Step B4: Is there anything you need BEFORE you can take that action?**
- If YES → That prerequisite is your real next action. Address it first.
- If NO → Go to Section A, Step A1 with this action.

→ Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION C: Abandoned Action — "I keep starting but can't sustain it"

**Step C1: How many times have you started and stopped?**
- 1-2 times → You haven't really tried yet. Go to Section A.
- 3+ times → There's a structural problem. Continue to Step C2.

**Step C2: At what point do you stop each time?**
- Write down specifically when you quit. Look for the pattern.
  - "I stop when it gets hard" → Go to Step C3.
  - "I stop when something else comes up" → Go to Step C4.
  - "I stop when I don't see results" → Go to Step C5.
  - "I don't know, I just... stop" → Go to Step C6.

**Step C3: The difficulty wall.**
- You're hitting the point where the learning curve steepens or the work gets genuinely challenging.
- Action: Break the hard part into sub-parts. Which specific sub-part stops you? Address ONLY that sub-part.
- If the sub-part requires a skill you don't have → Use the Learning Acceleration Procedure for that specific skill.
- **What you should see**: The intimidating monolith broken into manageable pieces.

**Step C4: Competing commitments.**
- List everything that "comes up" and takes priority. These are your competing commitments.
- For each one, ask: "Is this genuinely more important, or does it just feel more urgent?"
  - More important → Your action plan needs to account for this reality. Reduce the scope of your target action so it fits around the competing commitment.
  - More urgent but less important → Create a pre-commitment: decide IN ADVANCE what you'll do when the competing commitment appears. Write it down: "When [urgent thing] comes up, I will [specific response] and then return to [my action] at [specific time]."
- **What you should see**: A realistic plan that accounts for your actual life, not a fantasy life with no interruptions.

**Step C5: The feedback desert.**
- You need artificial progress markers because natural feedback is too slow.
- Create a tracking system: a simple log, spreadsheet, or physical chart.
- Track INPUTS (actions taken) not OUTPUTS (results achieved). You control inputs; outputs are lagging indicators.
- Review your input log weekly. If inputs are consistent, results will come. If inputs aren't consistent, that's the real problem — go to Step C2 and re-diagnose.
- **What you should see**: A visible record of effort that proves you're making progress even when results aren't visible yet.

**Step C6: The silent quit.**
- You stop without deciding to stop. The action just... fades.
- This usually means the action isn't connected to anything you actually care about.
- Ask: "If I never did this, what bad thing would actually happen?"
  - If you can't name a concrete consequence → You might not need to do this. It may be a "should" imposed by someone else's values. Reconsider whether this action belongs on your list at all.
  - If you CAN name a consequence → Make the consequence vivid and present. Write it on a card you see daily. The action fades because the consequence is abstract. Make it concrete.
- **What you should see**: Either a clear reason this action matters (which remotivates) or the realization that it doesn't (which frees you to drop it).

→ Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION D: Displacement Activity — "I'm busy but not on the right things"

**Step D1: List everything you did in the last 48 hours related to this goal.**
- Include planning, researching, organizing, discussing, and "preparing."
- **What you should see**: A list that's probably heavy on preparation and light on output.

**Step D2: Circle the items that produced a tangible artifact.**
- An artifact is something someone else could look at: a document, a prototype, a sent message, a completed form, a built thing.
- If everything else is planning/research/discussion → **You are using preparation as a substitute for action.**
- **What you should see**: The honest ratio of preparation to production.

**Step D3: Identify the one action you're avoiding.**
- Look at your list. What's conspicuously absent? What would you be doing if you were making real progress?
- That absent action is the one you're displacing.
- Why are you avoiding it? Write down the honest answer.
  - "It's scary" → Go to Section E, Step E3.
  - "It's boring" → Go to Step D4.
  - "I don't know how" → Go to Section B.
  - "It doesn't matter as much as these other things" → Are you sure? If yes, change your goal. If no, see Step D4.

**Step D4: Make a rule: produce before you prepare.**
- Before any planning/research/organizing session, you must produce one artifact first.
- The artifact can be small (a single email, one paragraph, one prototype sketch).
- This inverts the displacement pattern: production first, then preparation as a reward.
- **What you should see**: Daily output of at least one artifact, even on low-motivation days.

→ Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION E: Diagnosis — "I don't know why I'm stuck"

**Step E1: The physical test.**
- Stand up. Walk to where you would do the action. Put your hands on the tools you'd use (keyboard, phone, pen, whatever).
- What happened?
  - "I started doing it" → Your problem was activation energy. Go to Section A.
  - "I felt resistance in my body" (tension, avoidance, wanting to walk away) → Continue to Step E2.
  - "I realized I don't actually know the next step" → Go to Section B.

**Step E2: Name the competing commitment.**
- Complete this sentence: "I'm committed to [the action], but I'm also committed to ___."
- The blank is the competing commitment. Common ones:
  - "...not looking stupid"
  - "...keeping my options open"
  - "...not disrupting my current life"
  - "...being seen as competent"
  - "...avoiding conflict"
- **What you should see**: The hidden commitment that's actually running the show.

**Step E3: The emotional barrier.**
- Name the emotion: fear, shame, anxiety, dread, boredom, resentment.
- Now ask: "What's the worst thing that happens if I do this action and it goes badly?"
- Write down the worst case. Read it aloud.
- Now ask: "Could I survive that worst case?"
  - YES (which is almost always true) → The fear is disproportionate to the actual risk. Acknowledge the fear, then do the action anyway. Fear + action = courage. Fear + inaction = stagnation.
  - NO (actual catastrophic risk) → Your inaction might be justified. Reduce the risk: find a smaller first action that tests the waters without full exposure. Go to Section A, Step A1 with the reduced-risk version.
- **What you should see**: The actual risk stated clearly, which is almost always smaller than the imagined risk.

**Step E4: The identity check.**
- Complete this sentence: "The kind of person who does [this action] is ___."
- Is that description compatible with how you see yourself?
  - YES → Your block isn't identity. Return to Step E1 and pick a different path.
  - NO → You've found the core issue. You're not blocked by logistics, emotions, or knowledge. You're blocked because the action requires becoming someone you haven't decided to become yet.
  - **What to do**: You need to decide: are you willing to update your self-concept? If yes, start with the smallest action that the "new identity" person would take, and do it once. Identity follows behavior, not the other way around. One action doesn't make you that person. But it starts the shift.

→ Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### COMPLETION CHECK

Answer these questions:

1. **Did you take at least one concrete action as a result of this procedure?**
   - YES → The procedure worked. Repeat the triggering mechanism (Section A, Step A4) daily.
   - NO → Which section did you end up in? Return to that section and identify what's still blocking you. If you've been through multiple sections without acting, the block is likely in Section E (emotional/identity) regardless of where you think it is.

2. **Is the action sustainable, or was it a one-time push?**
   - Sustainable (trigger exists, environment supports it, competing commitments managed) → You're done.
   - One-time push → Go to Section C to build sustainability.

3. **Are you doing the RIGHT action, or just AN action?**
   - Right action (connected to real goal, produces artifacts, passes the "does this actually matter" test) → You're done.
   - Just busy → Go to Section D.

---

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The 2-Minute Rule
If the next action takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to a list, don't schedule it, don't think about it. Just do it now. Most meaningful progress chains are made of 2-minute links.

### Card 2: The Motivation Myth
```
What people think: Motivation → Action → Results
What actually works: Tiny Action → Small Result → Motivation → More Action → More Results
```
Start before you're motivated. Motivation is a consequence of action, not a prerequisite.

### Card 3: The Five Blockers (in order of frequency)
1. **Unclear next step** (50% of all inaction) → Make it concrete and tiny
2. **High activation energy** (20%) → Reduce setup friction
3. **Competing commitment** (15%) → Surface it, then choose
4. **Emotional barrier** (10%) → Name it, do it anyway
5. **Identity conflict** (5%) → Decide who you're becoming

### Card 4: The Displacement Detector
Ask: "Did I produce an artifact today, or did I only prepare to produce one?"
- Artifact = progress
- Preparation without artifact = probably displacement

---

## Step 5: Anticipate Failures (`/fla`)

### Failure Mode 1: "I did the tiny action but never scaled up"
**When it happens**: User does the "write one sentence" minimum every day but never moves beyond it. The tiny action becomes a ceiling, not a floor.
**How to recognize**: You've been doing the minimum for 2+ weeks with no natural expansion.
**Override**: After 2 weeks of consistent minimum, increase the minimum by 50%. "Write one sentence" becomes "write two sentences." If you resist this increase, the block isn't activation energy — it's in Section C or E. Re-diagnose.

### Failure Mode 2: "I diagnosed my block wrong"
**When it happens**: User classifies as Section B (unclear path) when the real issue is Section E (emotional barrier). They keep planning to avoid doing.
**How to recognize**: You have a clear next step and STILL aren't taking it.
**Override**: If you've been through Section B and have a clear action but aren't doing it, skip directly to Section E. Path clarity was never your problem.

### Failure Mode 3: "The procedure worked once but I stopped using it"
**When it happens**: User follows the procedure, gets a burst of productivity, then reverts to old patterns.
**How to recognize**: Looking at this procedure 3 weeks later thinking "I should do this again."
**Override**: The procedure is a diagnostic tool, but the trigger (Step A4) is the sustaining mechanism. If you built a trigger and it stopped working, the trigger wasn't specific enough or the environment changed. Rebuild the trigger for your current environment.

### Failure Mode 4: "I'm taking action on the wrong thing"
**When it happens**: User feels productive because they're executing consistently, but the actions don't connect to meaningful outcomes.
**How to recognize**: High effort, low results. Busy but not progressing.
**Override**: This procedure assumes you've already identified the right question (Procedure 1) and learned what you need (Procedure 2). If you skipped those, go back. Efficient execution of the wrong strategy is worse than inefficient execution of the right one.

### Failure Mode 5: "The emotional barrier keeps coming back"
**When it happens**: User works through Section E, takes action, but the fear/anxiety returns each time.
**How to recognize**: Every session starts with the same emotional resistance despite past success.
**Override**: Recurring emotional barriers that survive evidence ("I succeeded last time but I'm still afraid this time") may indicate deeper patterns that a flowchart can't resolve. Consider working with a therapist or coach. This isn't weakness — it's the right tool for the right problem.

---

## Step 6: Validate Executability (`/pv`)

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Every step is a concrete action (write, list, do, walk, stand up) — not "consider" or "reflect" | PASS |
| All decision points are binary or explicit multiple choice | PASS |
| No jargon without inline definition | PASS — competing commitments, activation energy, displacement all defined in context |
| Every path terminates | PASS — all sections lead to Completion Check; recursive loops bounded by re-diagnosis |
| Someone with no expertise could follow this | PASS — requires self-honesty, not domain knowledge |
| Steps reference observable outputs | PASS — "artifact," "trigger written down," "list on paper" |
| At least one step requires physical action before continuing | PASS — Step A2 ("do it before reading the next step"), Step E1 ("stand up and walk") |

**Issue found and fixed**: Section E Step E3 ("Could I survive that worst case?") could be misapplied to genuinely high-risk situations (e.g., financial ruin). Added the NO path with risk-reduction alternative to prevent someone from dismissing legitimate risk.

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Treating this as another planning exercise.** If you read this entire procedure and don't take a physical action before putting it down, you've fallen into the meta-trap. The procedure only works if you DO the steps, not read about them.

2. **Starting at Section E when the problem is Section A.** Most inaction is caused by unclear or too-large next steps, not deep psychological blocks. Try the simplest explanation first.

3. **Blaming willpower.** "I just need more discipline" is almost never the right diagnosis. If you need willpower to do something daily, your environment is wrong or your action is too large.

4. **Skipping the trigger (Step A4).** Taking one action feels like success. But without a trigger, you won't take the action tomorrow. The trigger is where the procedure converts from a one-time intervention to a sustainable behavior.

5. **Assuming you need to fix yourself.** Sometimes the action is wrong, not you. If sustained effort through this procedure still yields no progress, revisit whether this is actually the right action (go back to the Wrong Question Detection Procedure).

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **When you genuinely need more information**: This procedure assumes the knowledge exists. If you truly don't know what to do (not "I'm uncertain" but "I have no information"), go learn first.
- **When rest is the right action**: Chronic inaction can be burnout, not blockage. If you're exhausted, the procedure is: rest, recover, then come back. Forcing action through exhaustion produces garbage output.
- **When the action requires other people's cooperation**: This procedure is for individual action. If your block is "I need my boss to approve this" or "I need my team to agree," you need a negotiation/influence procedure, not a personal action procedure.
- **When you're grieving, in crisis, or processing trauma**: Action-forcing procedures are inappropriate during acute emotional events. Handle the human need first.

---

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: The Side Project Developer

**Situation**: Has learned React, has a project idea, has a design doc. Hasn't written a line of code in 6 weeks.
**Step 0**: "I know what to do but can't make myself do it." → Section A.
- A1: "Write the app" → "Set up the project" → "Run create-react-app" → "Open the terminal." Shrunken action: open the terminal.
- A2: Opens terminal. Done. → A3.
- A3: Types `npx create-react-app my-project`. Done. Next: create the first component file. Does it. Next: write the component skeleton. Does it. 25 minutes pass.
- A4: Trigger: "After I close Slack at end of workday, I will open the terminal and write one component."

**Result**: The 6-week block was pure activation energy. Once started, momentum carried.

### Example 2: The Aspiring Author

**Situation**: Has an outline, has researched the topic thoroughly, has blocked "writing time" on the calendar for months. Spends writing time reorganizing notes instead.
**Step 0**: "I'm doing things but not the right things." → Section D.
- D1: Last 48 hours: reorganized Notion workspace, read 3 articles "for research," color-coded the outline, discussed the book with a friend.
- D2: Artifacts produced: zero. No sentences written.
- D3: The avoided action: writing actual sentences. Why? "It's scary — what if it's bad."
- → Section E, Step E3: Worst case if the writing is bad? "I delete it and try again." Can I survive that? Obviously yes.
- Returns to Section A, Step A1: "Write one bad sentence. It doesn't have to be good."
- A2: Writes one sentence. Then another. Then a paragraph.
- D4: New rule: before opening Notion to organize, write 200 words first. Organizing is the reward.

**Result**: Displacement activity was a coping mechanism for fear of judgment. Making the first output explicitly "allowed to be bad" removed the barrier.

### Example 3: The Health-Conscious Non-Exerciser

**Situation**: Knows exercise is important. Has a gym membership. Has workout plans saved. Goes once, then stops for months. Repeat 5 times.
**Step 0**: "I keep starting but can't sustain it." → Section C.
- C1: Started and stopped 5 times. Structural problem.
- C2: "I stop when something else comes up." → Step C4.
- C4: Competing commitments: work deadlines, family dinners, social plans, fatigue. All feel "more important."
  - Are they genuinely more important? Work deadlines: sometimes. Family: sometimes. Social plans: rarely. Fatigue: usually not.
  - Pre-commitment: "When a work deadline competes with gym time, I will do a 15-minute home workout instead of skipping entirely. When I'm tired, I will go to the gym and do only 10 minutes — I'm allowed to leave after 10 minutes."
- Creates trigger: "After I put on my shoes in the morning, I will put my gym bag by the door."

**Result**: The all-or-nothing framing ("full workout or nothing") was the structural problem. Permission to do a tiny version removed the competing commitment pressure.
