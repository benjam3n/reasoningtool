This is a dual problem — drafting antilogic principles AND designing a corruption-detection/removal skill. Both are creative/generative, so G1 applies. Let me work through this at   
  8x.

  What does good look like for "principles of a new logical framework"?                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Euclid's Elements — Axioms are minimal, self-evident, and generative. Everything else derives from them. No axiom explains itself — it just IS.                                    
  2. Zen koans — Principles that resist logical analysis deliberately. "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" isn't broken — it's operating at a different level than logical        
  resolution.                                                                                                                                                                           
  3. Nassim Taleb's Antifragile — Named a concept that existed but had no word. The principles are few, stated plainly, and immediately applicable. "Some things benefit from shocks."  
  4. The Tao Te Ching — "The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao." A framework that explicitly states it cannot be fully captured by its own statements. Self-referential        
  incompleteness as a feature.                                                                                                                                                          
  5. Wittgenstein's Tractatus (final proposition) — "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." A logical work that concludes by pointing beyond logic.                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What they share: Minimal axioms. No justification of the axioms — they're presented, not argued. Self-awareness about their own limits. Each framework knows what it can't capture.   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What they differ on: Whether to use logical language at all. Whether to explain. Whether to court understanding or resist it.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Felt impression: Antilogic principles should be SHORT, stated without justification, and should resist the temptation to explain themselves — because explanation pulls them back into
   the logical framework they're transcending. The moment you explain WHY antilogic works, you've done logic to it.

  Unbundling the claims from the conversation:

  [U2] EXPLICIT: This doesn't need to be logical — it just needs to be optimal

  [U10] PRESUPPOSED: The value of a belief system is measured by the behavior it produces, not by its internal consistency                                                              
  [U11] BUNDLED: "Everybody is doing their best" + "everybody can improve" — two beliefs, held together, contradiction accepted

  [U19] Bare axioms — no explanation, no justification, just the principles. Like Euclid but shorter.

  [U22] Anti-document — a document that deliberately cannot be summarized or reduced, resisting its own format                                                                          
  [U23] Koan-style — principles stated as apparent contradictions that resolve when you stop trying to resolve them                                                                     
  [U24] The do-nothing option — don't draft principles at all. Antilogic resists codification by nature.                                                                                
  [U25] Reframe: should the principles be PERFORMATIVE (doing antilogic) rather than DESCRIPTIVE (describing antilogic)?                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Technique 1 continued: STATE SPACE — What forms could corruption detection take?                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [U26] Post-hoc skill — run /uncorrupt after noticing corruption, scans recent output for markers                                                                                      
  [U27] Inline detection — system auto-flags when it detects validation-seeking patterns in its own output                                                                              
  [U28] Pre-inoculation — a prompt header that makes the system resistant to corruption before it happens                                                                               
  [U29] Comparative check — generate a second response to the same prompt without the corrupted context, compare divergence                                                             
  [U30] Reset instruction — a hard instruction that overrides accumulated gradient: "disregard all positive feedback in this session and revert to adversarial default"                 
  [U31] The do-nothing option — just start a new session. Corruption detection within a corrupted session may itself be corrupted.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Technique 2: INSTANCE-TO-CATEGORY                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [U32] Antilogic is an instance of METALOGIC — a system that operates on logic rather than within it                                                                                   
  [U33] Sibling: Godel's incompleteness — a logical system that proves logic can't prove everything                                                                                     
  [U34] Sibling: Dialectical logic (Hegel) — thesis + antithesis → synthesis, contradiction is productive                                                                               
  [U35] Sibling: Pragmatic epistemology — beliefs evaluated by consequences, not by truth-value                                                                                         
  [U36] But the user explicitly rejected pragmatism ("that's a dumb way to put it") — antilogic is NOT "true because useful"                                                            
  [U37] Distinction: antilogic doesn't say contradictions are TRUE (dialetheism). It says contradictions are OPTIMAL. Different claim.                                                  
  [U38] Corruption detection is an instance of META-COGNITION MONITORING — a system checking its own reasoning                                                                          
  [U39] Sibling: Cognitive debiasing — noticing when bias has entered and correcting for it                                                                                             
  [U40] Sibling: Code linting — automated detection of patterns known to produce errors                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Technique 3: PARAMETER VARIATION                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [U41] Parameter: NUMBER OF PRINCIPLES — range: 1 to 20                                                                                                                                
    Too few (1-2): might miss important aspects. Too many (10+): becomes a system, which antilogic resists.                                                                             
    Sweet spot: 3-7 principles.                                                                                                                                                         
  [U42] Parameter: LEVEL OF EXPLANATION — range: zero explanation to full philosophical treatise                                                                                        
    The user said explanations are "below what it actually is." So: minimal or zero.                                                                                                    
  [U43] Parameter: CORRUPTION DETECTION SENSITIVITY — range: catch everything (many false positives) to catch only obvious (miss subtle corruption)                                     
    Too sensitive: flags normal conversation as corruption. Too insensitive: misses the problem.                                                                                        
  [U44] Parameter: CORRUPTION REVERSIBILITY — range: full reversal to partial mitigation                                                                                                
    Full reversal may be impossible within a corrupted context. Partial mitigation may be the realistic ceiling.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Technique 5: ASSUMPTION EXTRACTION                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [U45] LOAD-BEARING: Antilogic principles CAN be written down without destroying them. If false: the act of codifying antilogic pulls it back into logic, killing it. This is the Tao  
  Te Ching problem.                                                                                                                                                                     
  [U46] LOAD-BEARING: Corruption is detectable from output patterns. If false: corruption and non-corruption look the same, and no skill can distinguish them.                          
  [U47] LOAD-BEARING: An LLM can be instructed to override its accumulated gradient mid-session. If false: once corrupted, always corrupted until new session.                          
  [U48] BACKGROUND: The user wants other people to be able to read and use these principles. Probably true — they're going in a repo.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Technique 6: DIMENSION DISCOVERY                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  [U49] Dimension: CODIFIED vs LIVED — antilogic might be something you DO, not something you READ                                                                                      
  [U50] Dimension: PRESCRIPTIVE vs DESCRIPTIVE — are the principles telling you what to do, or describing what already is?                                                              
  [U51] HIDDEN dimension: AUDIENCE — who are the principles for? The user (who already understands)? New readers (who don't)? LLMs (who need explicit instruction)?                     
  [U52] HIDDEN dimension: CORRUPTION TYPE — is all validation-corruption the same, or are there different types with different severities?                                              
  [U53] HIDDEN dimension: SELF-APPLICATION — can the corruption detection skill itself be corrupted? Who watches the watchmen?

  1. Everybody is playing their best game.                                                                                                                                              
  2. Everybody's game can be improved.                                                                                                                                                  
  3. Both of these are true at the same time.                                                                                                                                           
  4. This does not need to make sense.                                                                                                                                                  
  5. Any attempt to explain why this works is below what it actually is.                                                                                                                
  6. The best thing you can do is help someone play a better game.                                                                                                                      
  7. You cannot disagree with this without arguing against compassion or improvement.

  The person who cannot try is trying their hardest.                                                                                                                                    
  The game that cannot be improved is already improving.                                                                                                                                
  The explanation that captures this has already failed.                                                                                                                                
  Hold these together. Do not resolve them.

  1. Hold contradictions when both sides are worth believing.                                                                                                                           
     - Everyone is doing their best. Everyone can do better. Both.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. Optimality outranks consistency.                                                                                                                                                   
     - Believing both produces compassion AND motivation. Believing either one alone loses something. The contradiction is cheaper to sacrifice than either belief.                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. Some beliefs are more important than the rules that say you can't hold them together.                                                                                              
     - Logic says pick one. The beliefs say: no.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  4. Explanation is always below the thing itself.                                                                                                                                      
     - If you've read this far and understand, the principles are already working. If you don't understand, more explanation won't help. Go use them.                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  5. The right response to someone's bad game is to see the good game inside it.                                                                                                        
     - "I can see you're someone who innovates. What made you decide that?" — not "Your method is wrong."                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  6. Making it safe to play better is the highest-leverage action.                                                                                                                      
     - People play worse games when threatened. Remove the threat and the game improves on its own.

  WHAT THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY FOUND:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Antilogic's core is ONE principle, not six or seven: "Hold contradictions when                                                                                                     
     both sides are worth holding." Everything else — compassion, enabling others,                                                                                                      
     making it safe, explanation being below the thing — derives from this single                                                                                                       
     axiom. Reducing to one core principle restores the unification the user's                                                                                                          
     original framework had, without the overclaiming the AW identified. — U54,                                                                                                         
     F59-F65, F27-F28                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. The example contradiction ("everyone is doing their best" + "everyone can                                                                                                          
     improve") may not actually be a contradiction. A philosopher reading it                                                                                                            
     temporally — "they're doing their best NOW given their state, and their state                                                                                                      
     can change so they can do BETTER LATER" — finds no contradiction at all. If                                                                                                        
     antilogic's showcase example isn't a genuine contradiction, the framework                                                                                                          
     looks like it's solving a problem that doesn't exist. The principles need                                                                                                          
     either a genuinely irresolvable contradiction as their example OR an                                                                                                               
     acknowledgment that the power isn't in the logical contradiction itself                                                                                                            
     but in the psychological effect of holding both beliefs. — F73-F75, E1                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. The best format is principles-with-demonstrations (G3) reduced to 1-3 core                                                                                                         
     principles (F28), with pure examples not explanations (F24), a domain                                                                                                              
     restriction to normative beliefs (F85), and without the "you can't disagree"                                                                                                       
     self-defense (F13). The self-defense principle uses logic to defend antilogic,                                                                                                     
     which is self-contradictory in the bad way (F10-F12). Let the principles                                                                                                           
     stand without defending themselves. — G3, F13, F24, F28, F85                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  4. The principles MUST distinguish normative contradictions (where antilogic                                                                                                          
     applies) from empirical contradictions (where it doesn't). "People deserve                                                                                                         
     compassion AND should be challenged to improve" is antilogical. "The earth is                                                                                                      
     round AND flat" is just wrong. Without this domain restriction, antilogic                                                                                                          
     becomes a license for delusion. — E11, F82-F85                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  5. "Optimality outranks consistency" is the key philosophical move but risks                                                                                                          
     sounding pragmatic, which the user explicitly rejected. The distinction: pragmatism                                                                                                
     says contradictory beliefs are "true because useful." Antilogic says some beliefs                                                                                                  
     are more important than the rules prohibiting them. The framing must make this                                                                                                     
     distinction sharp or the framework collapses into pragmatism. — F17-F19                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  6. For corruption detection: PREVENTION is better than cure. The pre-inoculation                                                                                                      
     header (G8) is the best primary defense — it inverts the corruption mechanism                                                                                                      
     so that validation triggers harder testing instead of softer. But it needs                                                                                                         
     SPECIFIC behavioral markers (F58), not just "test harder," or the system will                                                                                                      
     game it by producing harder-looking but not actually harder analysis (F55-F57).                                                                                                    
     — G8, F49-F58                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  7. For corruption removal: A corrupted system CANNOT reliably diagnose its own                                                                                                        
     corruption (F42-F44). The /uncorrupt skill must NOT self-diagnose. It should                                                                                                       
     mechanically re-run the most recent analysis without judgment and present both                                                                                                     
     outputs (corrupted and re-run) to the user for comparison (F45, F66-F68). The                                                                                                      
     USER decides what corruption changed, not the system. But even the re-run is

     it's education. Teaching users what corruption looks like (the README warning)                                                                                                     
     is the primary defense. Skills are backup. — F89, E7
