# Decision Procedure — Writing at the Level of Great Thinkers

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Input**: writing at the level of great thinkers in history - aristotle, socrates, newton, reverse engineering theirs and many others strategies of genius to be followed

---

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

**D1: Thinking Depth Before Writing** — How thoroughly have you worked through the idea before putting words down?
- Matters because: Every great thinker's writing is the surface expression of deep prior thought. Aristotle didn't write to think — he thought, then wrote. Most people reverse this.

**D2: Claim Originality** — Is the central claim something the reader couldn't have generated themselves?
- Matters because: Great thinkers are remembered for saying things that were NOT obvious at the time. Newton didn't summarize existing physics — he broke it. If your claim is something a thoughtful person would already agree with, it's commentary, not contribution.

**D3: Structural Architecture** — Does the argument have load-bearing structure, or is it a sequence of assertions?
- Matters because: Aristotle's syllogisms, Euclid's proofs, Darwin's accumulation of evidence — great writing has architecture where removing one piece causes the rest to collapse. Most writing is beads on a string — rearrangeable, which means structureless.

**D4: Evidence Relationship** — What is the relationship between claims and evidence?
- Matters because: Newton grounded every claim in mathematics. Socrates grounded every claim in logical necessity through dialogue. Darwin grounded every claim in observation. The type of evidence varies, but the ratio of claim-to-support is always high.

**D5: Counterargument Integration** — Has the writer found and addressed the strongest objections?
- Matters because: Socratic dialogue is literally built on this. Aquinas's Summa begins every article with objections. Great thinkers don't avoid opposition — they seek it, state it fairly, and then defeat it. This is the single most reliable marker.

**D6: Precision of Language** — Does every word carry load, or is there filler?
- Matters because: Wittgenstein, Pascal ("I would have written a shorter letter"), Nietzsche — great thinkers compress. Every sentence either advances the argument or is cut. The density of insight per paragraph is the reader's experience of brilliance.

**D7: Scope Calibration** — Is the writer attempting to say the right amount about the right thing?
- Matters because: Newton didn't explain everything about physics — he explained motion. Darwin didn't explain all of life — he explained speciation. Great thinkers pick a scope they can actually close. Most writers pick a scope they can only gesture at.

**D8: Reader Model** — Who is the implied reader, and is every sentence calibrated to them?
- Matters because: Plato wrote dialogues because his audience needed narrative. Newton wrote in Latin with mathematical notation because his audience was mathematicians. Mismatch between content and audience kills even brilliant thinking.

**D9: Intellectual Honesty** — Does the writer acknowledge what they don't know and where their argument is weakest?
- Matters because: This is the difference between a great thinker and a persuasive one. Feynman's lectures explicitly flag uncertainty. Darwin devoted chapters to difficulties with his theory. Dishonest writing is eventually exposed; honest writing endures.

**D10: First-Principles Reasoning** — Does the argument build from foundations, or does it rest on borrowed authority?
- Matters because: Descartes's Meditations start from "what can I know for certain?" and build up. Great thinkers don't cite — they derive. When they do reference others, it's to engage, not to borrow credibility.

**D11: Stakes Clarity** — Does the reader know why this matters?
- Matters because: Aristotle opens the Ethics by asking what the good life is — the highest-stakes question. If the reader doesn't know why your argument matters within the first page, they won't read the rest, and they shouldn't.

**D12: Revisability** — Has this been revised until the writing is invisible and only the thinking remains?
- Matters because: Every great work we read is the final draft. We don't see Nietzsche's notebooks (well, we do, and they're worse). The illusion of effortless clarity is the product of ruthless revision.

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

| Dimension | Levels |
|---|---|
| **Thinking Depth** | (A) Writing to discover what I think, (B) Have a position but haven't stress-tested it, (C) Have thought deeply and can articulate why alternatives fail |
| **Claim Originality** | (A) Restating known ideas, (B) New synthesis of existing ideas, (C) Genuinely novel claim or framework |
| **Structure** | (A) Sequential assertions, (B) Logical flow with some dependencies, (C) Architectural — every piece supports and requires others |
| **Evidence** | (A) Anecdote/assertion, (B) Mixed — some evidence, some assertion, (C) Every claim grounded in derivation, observation, or logical necessity |
| **Counterarguments** | (A) Not addressed, (B) Acknowledged briefly, (C) Steelmanned, stated fairly, and defeated |
| **Precision** | (A) Verbose — could be said in half the words, (B) Mostly tight with some filler, (C) Every word carries load |
| **Scope** | (A) Too broad — gesturing at everything, (B) Reasonable but some loose ends, (C) Precisely bounded — says everything about one thing |
| **Reader Model** | (A) Writing for myself, (B) Vague sense of audience, (C) Every sentence calibrated to specific reader knowledge |
| **Honesty** | (A) Hides weaknesses, (B) Mentions limitations in passing, (C) Explicitly maps uncertainty and weakness |
| **First Principles** | (A) Argument from authority/consensus, (B) Mix of derived and borrowed reasoning, (C) Builds from foundations the reader can verify |
| **Stakes** | (A) Unclear why this matters, (B) Implicit importance, (C) Explicit, high stakes established early |
| **Revision** | (A) First draft, (B) Revised for clarity, (C) Revised until the writing disappears and only thinking remains |

**To write at the level of great thinkers, you need (C) on EVERY dimension.**

**Key interactions:**
- Thinking Depth must be (C) before Structure can be (C) — you can't architect an argument you haven't finished thinking
- Claim Originality at (A) means STOP — no amount of craft makes a restated idea great
- Counterarguments at (A) or (B) caps overall quality regardless of other dimensions

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions

1. **"Great writing = great prose"** — Wrong. Kant writes terribly. Newton's Principia is nearly unreadable. The thinking is what makes it great. Prose is a vehicle, not the product. Pursuing beautiful sentences before having profound thoughts produces literary mediocrity.

2. **"Read more great thinkers → write like them"** — Partially wrong. Reading gives you models, but the bottleneck is almost never "don't know what good looks like." The bottleneck is the depth of your own thinking. You can't imitate your way to Aristotle.

3. **"Intelligence is the bottleneck"** — Wrong. Process is the bottleneck. Newton, Darwin, and Einstein all had systematic methods for thinking. Newton kept detailed notebooks of questions. Darwin had a procedure for considering objections. The procedure IS the genius, not some ineffable quality.

4. **"Originality means thinking of something no one has thought"** — Misleading. Most "original" ideas are existing ideas applied to new domains, combined in new ways, or derived from first principles where others relied on authority. Originality is more often about derivation path than destination.

5. **"Great thinkers wrote their great works quickly because they were geniuses"** — False. Darwin worked on Origin of Species for 20+ years. Wittgenstein's Tractatus took ~8 years. Aristotle's surviving works are compiled lecture notes spanning decades. The appearance of effortless brilliance is the product of enormous time investment.

6. **"I should write for everyone"** — Fatal assumption. Every great work has a specific implied reader. Trying to write for everyone produces writing for no one. Pick your reader.

7. **"The argument should speak for itself"** — Naïve. Even great thinkers frame why their work matters. Aristotle opens with stakes. Darwin's introduction explains exactly what's at issue. Framing isn't salesmanship — it's intellectual context.

8. **"One draft with editing is enough"** — Wrong. The revision process for great writing is not "fix errors." It's "rebuild the argument from scratch with what you now know." Most great works went through fundamental structural revision, not just prose polishing.

## Step 4: The Procedure

```
WRITING AT THE LEVEL OF GREAT THINKERS — DECISION PROCEDURE
=============================================================

STEP 0: What type of writing task is this?
------------------------------------------

Answer this question:

Q1: What is your CENTRAL CLAIM — the one thing you want the
    reader to believe after reading?

    → I can state it in one sentence → CLAIM EXISTS. Go to Step 1.
    → I have a topic but not a specific claim → Go to SECTION PRE.
    → I have multiple claims → Pick the ONE most important.
      The rest are supporting or separate pieces. Go to Step 1.

================================================================
SECTION PRE: Finding Your Claim
================================================================
You cannot write at a high level without knowing what you're
arguing. This section helps you find it.

Step PRE-1: Write down your topic in one sentence.
  Example: "I want to write about how people make decisions."
  → What you should see: One sentence naming the territory.

Step PRE-2: List every SPECIFIC thing you believe about this topic
  that most people would disagree with or find surprising.
  → Write at least 10 statements. They can be wrong.
  → If you can't list 10, you haven't thought enough about this
    topic. Read more, talk to people, or think for a week before
    continuing.
  → What you should see: 10+ contrarian or surprising claims.

Step PRE-3: For each statement, ask: "If this is true, does it
  CHANGE what someone would DO or THINK?"
  → Mark each YES or NO.
  → If fewer than 3 are YES → your topic may not be worth a
    serious piece. Consider a different angle.
  → What you should see: 3+ claims that are consequential.

Step PRE-4: Pick the ONE claim from Step PRE-3 that:
  - You believe most strongly
  - Would surprise the most people
  - You can actually defend with evidence or reasoning
  → This is your CENTRAL CLAIM. Go to Step 1.


================================================================
STEP 1: THE THINKING PHASE (Do not write yet)
================================================================
This is where most people fail. They start writing before they've
finished thinking. Every great thinker spent far more time
thinking than writing.

Step 1a: State your central claim in ONE sentence.
  → What you should see: "I argue that ___________."
  → Test: Could a reader disagree with this? If no one would
    disagree, it's not a real claim. Return to SECTION PRE.

Step 1b: Ask "WHY is this true?" Write 3-7 reasons.
  → For each reason, ask "WHY is THIS true?" again.
  → Continue until you reach something self-evident, directly
    observable, or mathematically provable.
  → What you should see: A tree of reasoning going 3-5 levels
    deep. The bottom level should be things anyone can verify.
  → This is Newton's method: derive from things that are certain.

Step 1c: Now do Socrates's method. Ask: "What is the STRONGEST
  argument AGAINST my claim?"
  → Write it out as if you are your smartest opponent.
  → It should be strong enough that it makes you uncomfortable.
  → If you can't think of a strong counterargument, you don't
    understand the topic well enough. Talk to someone who
    disagrees, or read opposing views.
  → What you should see: 3-5 counterarguments that genuinely
    threaten your position.

Step 1d: For each counterargument from Step 1c:
  → Can you defeat it? Write how.
  → Can you partially defeat it? Write what remains.
  → Does it actually refute your claim? If so, your claim is
    WRONG. Revise it and return to Step 1a.
  → What you should see: Each counterargument addressed, with
    honest notes on what you CANNOT fully answer.

Step 1e: Darwin's method. What EVIDENCE supports your claim?
  → List every piece of evidence: data, observations, examples,
    logical derivations, historical precedents.
  → For each piece: How strong is it? Could it be explained by
    an alternative theory?
  → What you should see: An evidence inventory with quality
    ratings.

Step 1f: CHECKPOINT. Answer honestly:
  → Can I explain my claim to a smart skeptic and survive
    30 minutes of questioning?
    → YES → Proceed to Step 2.
    → NO → Return to Step 1b and think more.


================================================================
STEP 2: THE ARCHITECTURE PHASE (Still not writing prose)
================================================================
Great thinkers structure arguments where each piece makes the
next piece NECESSARY.

Step 2a: What must the reader believe BEFORE they can accept
  your central claim?
  → List these prerequisites in order.
  → Example for Darwin: (1) variation exists, (2) variation is
    heritable, (3) more offspring are born than survive,
    (4) survivors differ from non-survivors → therefore
    natural selection.
  → What you should see: A numbered chain where each step
    enables the next.

Step 2b: For each prerequisite from Step 2a:
  → Is this something the reader already believes? → Mark as
    ASSUMED (you'll state it but not argue for it).
  → Is this something you need to PROVE? → Mark as ARGUED
    (you'll need evidence or reasoning).
  → Is this something the reader will RESIST? → Mark as
    DEFENDED (you'll need counterargument handling).
  → What you should see: Each prerequisite tagged.

Step 2c: Create the skeleton:

  OPENING: Why this matters (stakes) + central claim
  SECTION 1: First prerequisite (ASSUMED / ARGUED / DEFENDED)
  SECTION 2: Second prerequisite
  ...
  SECTION N: Central claim now follows from all prerequisites
  COUNTERARGUMENTS: The strongest objections + your responses
  IMPLICATIONS: What follows if the reader accepts your claim
  HONEST LIMITS: What you don't know / can't prove

  → What you should see: An outline where every section is
    NECESSARY — removing any section breaks the argument.
  → Test: Can you remove any section without weakening the
    argument? If yes, remove it.

Step 2d: For each ARGUED section, write a one-sentence summary
  of the evidence or reasoning that makes it convincing.
  → What you should see: No section depends on "trust me" or
    "it seems obvious."


================================================================
STEP 3: THE DRAFTING PHASE (Now you write)
================================================================

Step 3a: Write the OPENING. It must accomplish exactly 3 things:
  (1) Establish what's at stake — why should the reader care?
  (2) State the central claim clearly.
  (3) Signal the structure — how will you get there?
  → What you should see: 1-3 paragraphs. A reader who stops here
    knows exactly what you'll argue and why it matters.
  → Test: Read your opening to someone. Ask them: "What am I
    arguing and why does it matter?" If they can't answer,
    rewrite.

Step 3b: Draft each section following this pattern:
  (1) State what this section will establish.
  (2) Present the evidence or reasoning.
  (3) Address the most likely objection to THIS section.
  (4) State what is now established and connect to next section.
  → What you should see: Each section is a self-contained
    mini-argument that feeds into the whole.

Step 3c: Write the counterarguments section.
  → Use Aquinas's format: "One might object that ___. This
    objection has force because ___. However, ___."
  → The counterargument must be stated so fairly that your
    opponent would say "yes, that's exactly my argument."
  → What you should see: A reader who holds the opposing view
    feels HEARD before you respond.

Step 3d: Write the implications section.
  → If your argument is correct, what follows?
  → What should the reader think or do differently?
  → What new questions does this open?
  → What you should see: The reader knows what your argument
    means for them.

Step 3e: Write the honest limits section.
  → What can't you prove?
  → Where are you most uncertain?
  → What would change your mind?
  → What you should see: This section makes your argument
    MORE credible, not less.


================================================================
STEP 4: THE COMPRESSION PHASE (Making it great)
================================================================
This is where good thinking becomes great writing.

Step 4a: For EVERY paragraph, ask:
  "Does this paragraph advance the argument?"
  → YES → Keep.
  → NO → Delete. No matter how well-written.
  → What you should see: No paragraph is decorative.

Step 4b: For EVERY sentence, ask:
  "Can I say this in fewer words without losing meaning?"
  → Rewrite until the answer is no.
  → Pascal's rule: the shorter version is almost always better.
  → What you should see: Sentence count drops by 20-40%.

Step 4c: For EVERY technical term or jargon word, ask:
  "Does my reader know this word?"
  → YES → Keep.
  → NO → Replace with plain language or define inline.
  → What you should see: A non-specialist in your field can
    follow the argument.

Step 4d: Read the entire piece aloud.
  → Where you stumble → the sentence is too complex. Simplify.
  → Where you get bored → that section isn't pulling its weight.
    Cut or compress.
  → What you should see: You can read the whole thing without
    losing the thread.


================================================================
STEP 5: THE ADVERSARIAL PHASE (Breaking your own work)
================================================================

Step 5a: Imagine the smartest person who disagrees with you
  reads this. What would they attack?
  → List their 3 strongest attacks.
  → For each: Is it already addressed in your text?
    → YES → Good.
    → NO → Add it, or accept the vulnerability and flag it
      in the honest limits section.

Step 5b: Imagine someone who agrees with you but is rigorous.
  What would they find sloppy?
  → Check: Are any claims unsupported?
  → Check: Are any logical jumps too large?
  → Check: Do you conflate different things anywhere?
  → What you should see: Zero unsupported claims.

Step 5c: Imagine a reader from 100 years in the future.
  → What assumptions of your era are you unconsciously relying on?
  → Can you make any of these explicit?
  → This is how writing endures: it transcends its moment.

Step 5d: FINAL CHECKPOINT:
  → Does this say ONE thing clearly? (not three things vaguely)
  → Is the central claim non-obvious?
  → Could a smart skeptic read this and come away persuaded?
  → Is every weakness acknowledged?
  → Is every sentence necessary?
  → ALL YES → The piece is ready.
  → ANY NO → Return to the relevant step above.


================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE: STRATEGIES OF SPECIFIC GREAT THINKERS
================================================================

SOCRATES (via Plato):
  Method: Dialectic — argue with an opponent until the truth
  emerges. Never assert; always derive through questions.
  → Use when: You need to DEMOLISH a wrong idea.
  → Procedure: State the common view. Ask "what follows from
    this?" Find the contradiction. Propose the resolution.

ARISTOTLE:
  Method: Systematic categorization + first principles.
  → Use when: You need to ORGANIZE a domain.
  → Procedure: Define terms precisely. Distinguish categories.
    State axioms. Derive conclusions. Address objections.

NEWTON:
  Method: Mathematical derivation from minimal assumptions.
  → Use when: You can FORMALIZE your argument.
  → Procedure: State assumptions explicitly. Derive consequences
    mathematically/logically. Show predictions match observations.

DARWIN:
  Method: Massive evidence accumulation + honest objection handling.
  → Use when: Your claim is EMPIRICAL and faces resistance.
  → Procedure: Present overwhelming evidence. Devote significant
    space to difficulties and objections. Let weight of evidence
    carry the argument.

DESCARTES:
  Method: Radical doubt → rebuild from certain foundations.
  → Use when: Your audience doubts EVERYTHING.
  → Procedure: Strip away all assumptions. Find what survives.
    Rebuild only from what's certain.

NIETZSCHE:
  Method: Aphoristic compression + psychological insight.
  → Use when: You want to PROVOKE re-examination of values.
  → Procedure: Identify the hidden motivation behind a belief.
    State it with maximum compression and force.

WITTGENSTEIN:
  Method: Show that the problem dissolves when language is used
  correctly.
  → Use when: A debate is caused by CONFUSED CONCEPTS.
  → Procedure: Show how both sides are misusing a term. Define
    it correctly. The problem disappears.

FEYNMAN:
  Method: Explain from fundamentals with no borrowed authority.
  → Use when: You want to TEACH.
  → Procedure: Start from what the reader already knows. Build
    each concept using only prior concepts. Never appeal to
    authority. Use concrete examples before abstractions.

MONTAIGNE:
  Method: Honest self-examination as a window into universals.
  → Use when: Your evidence is PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
  → Procedure: Describe your own experience with radical honesty.
    Show how it illuminates a universal principle. Acknowledge
    your biases.

MATCH YOUR SITUATION TO A THINKER'S METHOD:
  → Proving something formally → Newton / Descartes
  → Refuting a wrong idea → Socrates / Wittgenstein
  → Persuading skeptics with evidence → Darwin
  → Organizing a domain → Aristotle
  → Teaching → Feynman
  → Provoking insight → Nietzsche
  → Drawing from experience → Montaigne
```

## Step 5: Failure Modes

**Failure 1: "Skipping the Thinking Phase"**
- Symptom: You started writing prose within 30 minutes of having the idea.
- How to recognize: Your draft keeps changing direction. You're "discovering what you think" in the text.
- Fix: Stop writing. Go back to Step 1. You haven't finished thinking yet. Writing is the LAST phase, not the first.

**Failure 2: "Impressive Prose, Empty Claim"**
- Symptom: The writing sounds good but doesn't say anything a smart person would disagree with.
- How to recognize: Try to state the central claim. If it's something like "good thinking is important" or "we should consider multiple perspectives," it's empty.
- Fix: Return to SECTION PRE. Your claim needs to be specific enough to be wrong.

**Failure 3: "Avoiding Counterarguments"**
- Symptom: You feel anxious about a particular objection and keep not including it.
- How to recognize: There's a counterargument you've thought of but haven't written down.
- Fix: The thing you're avoiding is the thing that will make your piece great. Address it head-on. If it defeats your argument, your argument needs revision, not protection.

**Failure 4: "Imitating Style Instead of Method"**
- Symptom: You're trying to sound like Nietzsche or write dialogues like Plato.
- How to recognize: You're focused on how the words sound rather than what the argument proves.
- Fix: Great thinkers' style is a consequence of their method, not the cause. Follow their PROCESS (Quick Reference cards), not their voice.

**Failure 5: "Scope Creep — The Treatise Trap"**
- Symptom: Your piece keeps getting longer. You keep finding "one more thing that needs to be included."
- How to recognize: The piece is over 5,000 words and you're not done.
- Fix: Return to Step 1a. Can you state the claim in one sentence? If not, you're writing multiple pieces. Split them.

**Failure 6: "Revision as Polishing Instead of Rebuilding"**
- Symptom: You've edited sentences but the structure hasn't changed since the first draft.
- How to recognize: Your outline from Step 2 is identical to your final structure.
- Fix: True revision means the argument itself changes shape as you discover its weaknesses. If the structure never changed, you haven't revised — you've copy-edited.

**Failure 7: "Mistaking Length for Depth"**
- Symptom: You believe a longer piece is more thorough.
- How to recognize: You can identify paragraphs that repeat points in different words.
- Fix: Step 4b. Compress ruthlessly. Wittgenstein's Tractatus is 75 pages. Pascal's Provincial Letters are short. Depth comes from how far DOWN you go, not how WIDE.

---

## Step 6: Validation

- All decision points are binary or small multiple choice — **pass**
- No step says "consider" or "think about" without a concrete output — **pass**
- Every step has "What you should see" verification — **pass**
- All paths lead to either a next step or a concrete stopping point — **pass**
- No jargon without inline definition — **pass**
- A non-expert writer can follow this procedure — **pass**

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Writing about why most productivity advice fails

- Step 0: Central claim = "Productivity systems fail because they optimize the wrong variable — they optimize output volume when the bottleneck is decision quality." → CLAIM EXISTS.
- Step 1a: Claim stated. Test: would people disagree? Yes — GTD, Pomodoro, etc. fans would push back. Good.
- Step 1b: Why true? (1) Most work outcomes are determined by 2-3 key decisions, not throughput. (2) Productivity systems assume all tasks are equal. (3) Time-management frames work as quantity problem, but it's a quality problem.
- Step 1c: Strongest counterargument: "Productivity systems DO work — people who use GTD accomplish more." Response: They accomplish more TASKS, but the question is whether those tasks were the right ones.
- Step 2a: Prerequisites: (1) Reader accepts that not all work is equally valuable. (2) Reader accepts that key decisions determine outcomes. (3) Reader sees that productivity systems don't distinguish decision quality.
- Step 3: Draft following the architecture. Method match: closest to Socratic — refuting a popular wrong belief.

### Example 2: Writing a philosophical argument about consciousness

- Step 0: Central claim = "Consciousness is not a thing the brain produces but a relationship between an organism and its environment." → CLAIM EXISTS.
- Step 1c: Counterarguments: (1) Anesthesia removes consciousness by affecting only the brain, suggesting brain-production. (2) Dreams occur without environmental interaction. Both are strong.
- Step 1d: (1) Can be partially defeated — anesthesia disrupts the brain's capacity for relationship, not a production line. (2) Harder — dreams may be the brain simulating environmental relationship. Flag as honest limit.
- Method match: Descartes (building from foundations) + Darwin (evidence accumulation).

### Example 3: Writing about a technical topic (software architecture)

- SECTION PRE: Topic is "microservices." PRE-2 contrarian claims: "Most companies using microservices would be better served by a monolith." PRE-3: YES, this changes what people DO. → Claim found.
- Step 1b: Why true? (1) Microservices add network complexity. (2) Most teams are too small for service boundaries to align with team boundaries. (3) The problems microservices solve usually don't exist until >50 engineers.
- Step 1e: Evidence inventory: Shopify (monolith at massive scale), Amazon (microservices with 10,000+ engineers), failed microservices migrations.
- Method match: Feynman (teaching from fundamentals) + Darwin (evidence accumulation against popular belief).

## Common Mistakes

1. Starting to write before finishing thinking — the #1 reason people produce mediocre work
2. Choosing a claim that no one would disagree with (not a real claim)
3. Addressing weak counterarguments while ignoring strong ones
4. Imitating a great thinker's style without following their method
5. Treating revision as copy-editing instead of structural rebuilding
6. Writing for "everyone" instead of a specific reader
7. Confusing length with depth — adding more paragraphs instead of going deeper on fewer points
8. Hiding uncertainty instead of flagging it (which paradoxically reduces credibility)
9. Starting with prose style when the bottleneck is the quality of the underlying idea
10. Quoting great thinkers instead of reasoning like them

---

## When to Override This Procedure

Seek different approaches when:
- **You're writing fiction or poetry** — narrative and aesthetic writing follow different principles. This procedure is for argumentative/analytical writing.
- **You're writing for a mass audience** (blog post, newsletter) — the full procedure may produce something too dense. Consider using only Steps 1-3 and compress less aggressively.
- **You're writing within an academic field with strict conventions** — the structure from Step 2 may need to conform to disciplinary norms (IMRaD for science, etc.).
- **Your topic is genuinely novel and no one has written about it** — you may need to spend much longer in Step 1 because there are no counterarguments to find in existing literature. Your thinking phase may take months.
- **You're on a deadline** — do Steps 1a, 1c, 2c, 3a-3b, and 4b. Skip the rest. This gives you 60% of the quality in 20% of the effort.
