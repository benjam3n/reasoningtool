# FIGURING OUT WHAT UTOPIA LOOKS LIKE — Decision Procedure

## Step 1: Decision Dimensions

What factors determine what "utopia" looks like for a given person or group?

**Dimension 1: Scope — Individual vs. Collective**
Who is the utopia for? One person's ideal life? A community? A nation? All of humanity? The scope radically changes what counts as utopian because individual freedom and collective coordination often trade off.

**Dimension 2: Time Horizon**
Near-term achievable (20 years)? Far-future aspirational (200 years)? Timeless ideal? This determines whether you're designing a plan or a north star.

**Dimension 3: Material Conditions**
What level of material abundance is assumed? Post-scarcity? Current resources? Constrained resources? This shapes whether the utopia focuses on distribution or production.

**Dimension 4: Human Nature Assumption**
Does the utopia require people to change, or does it work with people as they are? Utopias that require new kinds of humans fail differently than ones that channel existing motivations.

**Dimension 5: Governance Structure**
How are collective decisions made? Direct democracy? Representative? Technocratic? Anarchic? Algorithmic? No single structure satisfies everyone.

**Dimension 6: Freedom vs. Coordination Axis**
How much individual freedom vs. collective coordination? Maximum liberty (everyone does what they want) vs. maximum coordination (everyone contributes to shared goals).

**Dimension 7: Diversity vs. Coherence**
Does everyone live the same way, or is the utopia a framework that allows radically different lifestyles to coexist?

**Dimension 8: Relationship to Suffering**
Is the goal to eliminate all suffering? Minimize involuntary suffering? Accept some suffering as meaningful? This is the deepest philosophical divide.

**Dimension 9: Relationship to Nature/Environment**
Integrate with nature? Transcend it through technology? Restore it? This shapes everything from city design to diet to energy.

**Dimension 10: Role of Technology**
Technology as liberator? As threat? As tool to be carefully governed? As something to move beyond?

**Dimension 11: Meaning & Purpose Source**
Where does meaning come from? Work? Relationships? Creation? Exploration? Spirituality? Service? This determines what daily life looks like.

**Dimension 12: Change & Evolution**
Is utopia a fixed state or a process? Can the utopia itself evolve? Static utopias become dystopias when conditions change.

## Step 2: Options per Dimension

| Dimension | Options |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | (A) Personal ideal life, (B) Small community (<500), (C) City/region, (D) Nation, (E) Global, (F) Multi-planetary |
| **Time Horizon** | (A) Achievable now with political will, (B) 1 generation (20-30 yrs), (C) Multi-generational (100+ yrs), (D) Timeless ideal/north star |
| **Material Conditions** | (A) Current resources, better distributed, (B) Moderate abundance via technology, (C) Post-scarcity (energy/food/shelter solved), (D) Post-scarcity + post-labor |
| **Human Nature** | (A) Works with current human nature, (B) Requires modest cultural shifts, (C) Requires significant education/socialization changes, (D) Requires biological/cognitive modification |
| **Governance** | (A) Direct democracy, (B) Representative democracy, (C) Sortition (random selection), (D) Technocratic/expert, (E) Decentralized/anarchic, (F) Algorithmic/AI-assisted, (G) Hybrid/layered |
| **Freedom vs. Coordination** | (A) Maximum freedom, minimal rules, (B) High freedom with safety net, (C) Balanced reciprocity, (D) High coordination with opt-out rights, (E) Maximum coordination for shared goals |
| **Diversity vs. Coherence** | (A) Monoculture (shared values/lifestyle), (B) Pluralist framework (different zones/styles), (C) Radical pluralism (anything goes within harm limits) |
| **Relationship to Suffering** | (A) Eliminate all preventable suffering, (B) Eliminate involuntary suffering, (C) Minimize suffering but accept some as meaningful, (D) Focus on flourishing, not suffering reduction |
| **Nature/Environment** | (A) Rewilding/deep ecology, (B) Sustainable integration, (C) Technological transcendence, (D) Hybrid (wild zones + tech zones) |
| **Technology** | (A) Low-tech/appropriate tech, (B) Selective high-tech, (C) Full technological embrace, (D) Transhumanist/post-biological |
| **Meaning Source** | (A) Work/craft/mastery, (B) Relationships/community, (C) Exploration/discovery, (D) Creation/art, (E) Service/contribution, (F) Spiritual/contemplative, (G) Self-chosen mix |
| **Change Mechanism** | (A) Fixed constitution, (B) Amendable framework, (C) Continuous evolution with guardrails, (D) Fully fluid/emergent |

**Key Interactions:**
- If Material = Post-scarcity, then Meaning Source probably can't be "work" in the traditional sense
- If Human Nature = "as-is," then Governance can't assume perfect altruism
- If Diversity = Radical pluralism, then Governance must be decentralized or layered
- If Scope = Global, then Freedom vs. Coordination tension is much harder to resolve

## Step 3: Hidden Assumptions in Standard Utopian Thinking

1. **"There's one right answer."** Most utopian thinking assumes a single ideal. Reality: different people have genuinely incompatible values. A good procedure must surface these conflicts, not hide them.

2. **"More is better."** Assumes maximizing wealth, freedom, happiness, etc. But many utopian traditions value enough over more — sufficiency, not maximization.

3. **"Agreement is possible."** Assumes if people just thought clearly, they'd converge. They won't. Values diverge at the root level.

4. **"The designer is neutral."** Whoever designs the utopia embeds their values. This procedure must make the designer's values visible.

5. **"Stability = success."** Assumes a good utopia stays the same. But stasis is fragile. Resilience requires the capacity to change.

6. **"Current problems define the solution."** Utopias designed as reactions to current suffering often create new suffering. Escaping poverty ≠ knowing what abundance should look like.

7. **"Individuals know what they want."** People's stated preferences often conflict with their revealed preferences and their long-term wellbeing.

8. **"Scale doesn't matter."** What works for 50 people in a commune doesn't work for 50 million. The procedure must force you to address scale.

└──────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘


SECTION A: Personal Utopia (Your Ideal Life)
---------------------------------------------

Step A1: Write down what you did yesterday, hour by hour.
  → What you should see: A list of 10-16 activities.

Step A2: Next to each activity, mark it:
  [+] I'd do MORE of this in my ideal life
  [-] I'd do LESS or NONE of this
  [=] About the same
  → What you should see: A mix of +, -, and = marks.

Step A3: For each [-] item, write what you'd REPLACE it with.
  Not "nothing" — what would you actually do with that time?
  → What you should see: Specific replacement activities, not vague
    wishes like "relax more."

Step A4: For each [+] item, answer: What's stopping me from
  doing more of this RIGHT NOW?
  (a) Money → Go to Step A5
  (b) Time → Go to Step A6
  (c) Other people's expectations → Go to Step A7
  (d) Skills I don't have → Go to Step A8
  (e) Nothing, I just haven't prioritized it → Go to Step A9

Step A5 (Money barrier): How much money would you need per year
  to live your [+] life? Write a number. Is that number more or
  less than 2x your current income?
  - If LESS than 2x: Your utopia is a financial planning problem,
    not a civilization design problem. Look into lifestyle design.
  - If MORE than 2x: This item requires systemic change, not
    just personal change. Note it and continue.

Step A6 (Time barrier): What currently fills the time? Is it
  (a) paid work you need to survive, or (b) obligations you
  chose? If (a), your utopia requires changing how survival
  works. If (b), your utopia is available now through
  different choices.

Step A7 (Social expectation barrier): Whose expectation? Would
  defying it cost you something concrete (job, relationship) or
  just feel uncomfortable? If concrete cost → systemic barrier.
  If discomfort → your utopia is available now through courage.

Step A8 (Skills barrier): How long would it take to learn?
  Less than 1 year → your utopia is a learning plan, not a
  civilization redesign. More than 1 year → note it, continue.

Step A9 (Priority barrier): Then start doing it this week.
  Your utopia already exists. You're not living it by choice.

Step A10: Collect all the systemic barriers from A5-A8.
  These are the things that require SOCIETY to change for your
  ideal life to be possible. List them.
  → What you should see: 2-7 specific systemic barriers.

Step A11: For each systemic barrier, ask: "How many other people
  share this barrier?"
  - Millions+ → This is a political/economic problem
  - Thousands → This is a community/movement problem
  - Just me → This might not be a systemic barrier; re-examine

Step A12: Your personal utopia is:
  "A world where [list systemic barriers] are solved, and I
  spend my days [list of + and replacement activities]."

  → OUTPUT: Write this down. This is your utopia, grounded in
    your actual preferences, not abstract ideals.


SECTION B: Societal Utopia Design
----------------------------------

Step B1: Pick your scope.
  (a) Small community (under 500 people) → Go to B2
  (b) City or region → Go to B2
  (c) Nation → Go to B2
  (d) Global → Go to B2
  (e) Not sure → Default to (b), City or region. It's the
      smallest scale where systemic dynamics appear.

Step B2: Answer the SUFFERING QUESTION first.
  List the 5 worst forms of suffering that exist at your
  chosen scope today. Be specific — not "poverty" but
  "people unable to afford food despite working full-time."
  → What you should see: 5 specific, concrete suffering
    descriptions.

Step B3: For each suffering, identify its MECHANISM.
  Not who to blame — what structural mechanism produces it?
  Example: "Full-time workers can't afford food" → mechanism
  is "wages set by labor market don't track cost of living."
  → What you should see: 5 mechanisms, each one level more
    abstract than the suffering itself.

Step B4: For each mechanism, design a STRUCTURAL FIX.
  The fix must be:
  - Automatic (doesn't require ongoing goodwill)
  - Self-correcting (has feedback loops)
  - Specific (not "better education" but "free skill training
    matched to regional job demand, updated quarterly")
  → What you should see: 5 structural fixes.

Step B5: CONFLICT CHECK. Do any of your 5 fixes contradict
  each other?
  - Fix A requires centralized control but Fix C requires
    decentralization? → You have a design conflict. Go to B6.
  - No conflicts? → Go to B7.

Step B6: For each conflict, choose:
  (a) Prioritize one fix over the other (which suffering is
      worse?)
  (b) Find a design that satisfies both at reduced
      effectiveness
  (c) Separate them by domain (Fix A applies to healthcare,
      Fix C applies to education)
  Write down your resolution for each conflict.

Step B7: HUMAN NATURE CHECK. For each structural fix, ask:
  "Does this require people to behave differently than they
  do today?"
  - Yes, it requires people to be more generous → FRAGILE.
    Redesign the fix to work with self-interested people.
  - Yes, it requires people to be more rational → FRAGILE.
    Redesign for bounded rationality.
  - No, it channels existing behavior → ROBUST. Keep it.

Step B8: DAILY LIFE TEST. Describe a typical Tuesday for
  3 different people in your utopia:
  (a) Someone who loves their work
  (b) Someone who doesn't want to work
  (c) Someone who disagrees with the system
  → What you should see: All three have lives you'd consider
    acceptable. If person (c) is miserable or coerced, your
    utopia is a dystopia for dissenters.

Step B9: TRANSITION TEST. Starting from today's society,
  write 3 changes that would move toward your utopia.
  Each change must be:
  - Possible without total revolution
  - Beneficial even if the other changes never happen
  - Reversible if they fail
  → What you should see: 3 concrete, incremental steps.
  → If you can't write these, your utopia may be a fantasy
    rather than a vision. Go back to B4 and make fixes more
    incremental.

Step B10: EVOLUTION CHECK. How does your utopia handle:
  (a) New technology that disrupts its assumptions?
  (b) Population that doubles or halves?
  (c) Contact with a society that runs differently?
  (d) A generation that rejects its values?
  → If any of these break the utopia, add an amendment/
    evolution mechanism.

Step B11: Compile your output.
  YOUR UTOPIA:
  - Scope: [from B1]
  - Suffering eliminated: [from B2]
  - Via mechanisms: [from B4, revised by B5-B7]
  - Daily life looks like: [from B8]
  - Getting there: [from B9]
  - Evolves by: [from B10]


SECTION C: Evaluating an Existing Utopian Proposal
----------------------------------------------------

Step C1: State the proposal in 2-3 sentences.

Step C2: Run the SUFFERING CHECK.
  Does the proposal explicitly address the 5 worst current
  sufferings (from B2)? For each:
  - Addressed directly → ✓
  - Addressed indirectly → ?
  - Not addressed → ✗
  → If 3+ are ✗, the proposal is incomplete. It may be a
    good idea but it's not a utopia.

Step C3: Run the HUMAN NATURE CHECK (same as B7).
  Does it require people to be better than they are?

Step C4: Run the DISSENTER CHECK (same as B8c).
  What happens to someone who disagrees?

Step C5: Run the TRANSITION CHECK (same as B9).
  Can you get there from here?

Step C6: Run the EVOLUTION CHECK (same as B10).
  Can it adapt?

Step C7: Score the proposal.
  - Suffering addressed: __/5
  - Works with human nature: Yes / Partially / No
  - Dissenters treated well: Yes / Partially / No
  - Transition path exists: Yes / Partially / No
  - Can evolve: Yes / Partially / No

  → If all Yes: Strong utopian proposal.
  → If any No: Identify which No is the fatal flaw.


SECTION D: Finding Common Ground Between Visions
--------------------------------------------------

Step D1: Have each person complete Section A (Personal Utopia)
  independently.

Step D2: Collect all systemic barriers from everyone's Step A10.

Step D3: Sort barriers by frequency.
  - Barriers mentioned by 70%+ → SHARED PRIORITIES
  - Barriers mentioned by 30-70% → NEGOTIABLE
  - Barriers mentioned by <30% → INDIVIDUAL, not shared

Step D4: Design structural fixes (B4) for SHARED PRIORITIES
  only.

Step D5: For NEGOTIABLE items, use this rule:
  "Can we include this fix without undermining any shared
  priority fix?"
  - Yes → Include it
  - No → Exclude it, offer it as an opt-in for subgroups

Step D6: For INDIVIDUAL items:
  "Does the utopian framework allow individuals to pursue
  this on their own?"
  - Yes → No action needed
  - No → The framework is too restrictive. Revisit.

Step D7: Compile the shared utopia.
  - What everyone agrees on: [shared priorities + fixes]
  - What subgroups can opt into: [negotiable items]
  - What individuals handle themselves: [individual items]
  - Framework constraint: Must allow D6 individual pursuit
```

## Step 5: Failure Modes

**FAILURE 1: "Utopia as wish list."**
Symptom: Your utopia is a list of good things (peace, prosperity, freedom) with no mechanisms.
Recognition: You can't describe a typical Tuesday (Step B8).
Fix: Go back to B4. Every outcome needs a structural mechanism.

**FAILURE 2: "Projecting current frustrations."**
Symptom: Your utopia is just "the opposite of what annoys me now."
Recognition: Your utopia has no positive vision, only negations ("no poverty, no war, no...").
Fix: After listing what you'd eliminate, spend equal time on what you'd CREATE. What does a good day look like, not just a not-bad day?

**FAILURE 3: "The designer's utopia."**
Symptom: The utopia works great for people like you and poorly for people unlike you.
Recognition: In Step B8, you can only describe person (a) vividly. Persons (b) and (c) are vague or uncomfortable.
Fix: Find 2-3 people with very different values and ask them to evaluate using Section C.

**FAILURE 4: "The frozen utopia."**
Symptom: Your utopia would have been great in 1950 or 2020 but can't handle change.
Recognition: Step B10 reveals that any disruption breaks the system.
Fix: Replace fixed rules with adaptive processes. Instead of "everyone gets X," try "there's a mechanism that adjusts X based on Y."

**FAILURE 5: "Skipping the transition."**
Symptom: You have a beautiful end state but no path from here to there.
Recognition: Step B9 produces nothing concrete, or only produces "first, everyone must agree."
Fix: Work backward. What's the last step before utopia? What's the step before that? Keep going until you reach something achievable this decade.

**FAILURE 6: "Confusing personal preference with universal good."**
Symptom: You assume everyone wants what you want.
Recognition: Your Section A and Section B produce nearly identical outputs.
Fix: Run Section D with at least 3 people who disagree with you on important things.

## Step 6: Validation Check

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Can someone with no philosophy background follow this? | Yes — all steps are concrete actions (list, write, answer, mark) |
| Are all decision points explicit? | Yes — all use (a)/(b)/(c) routing or Yes/No |
| Does every path lead to an output? | Yes — each section ends with a compile step |
| Are there dead ends or loops? | No — B9 has a "go back" but with clear criteria |
| Is "use your judgment" avoided? | Yes — closest is B8 "acceptable" which is defined by the check itself |

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Personal Utopia (Section A)

Yesterday: 8hrs work (software), 1hr commute, 1hr cooking, 2hrs with kids, 1hr scrolling phone, 1hr exercise, 2hrs TV.

Marks: Work [-], Commute [-], Cooking [=], Kids [+], Phone [-], Exercise [+], TV [-].

Replacements: Work → 4hrs meaningful work + 4hrs building things. Commute → walking to local workspace. Phone → reading. TV → making music.

Barriers for [+] items: Kids (+) — time barrier → paid work fills the time (A6a) → systemic. Exercise (+) — priority barrier → A9, start this week.

Systemic barriers: "Must work 8hrs/day for survival despite 4hrs being productive."

Millions share this → political/economic problem.

**Output**: "A world where full-time survival requires 4hrs/day of work, and I spend my days building things, being with my kids, reading, making music, and exercising."

### Example 2: Evaluating a Proposal (Section C)

Proposal: "Universal Basic Income of $2000/month for all citizens."

- C2 Suffering check: Addresses food insecurity ✓, addresses housing instability ?, doesn't address loneliness ✗, doesn't address meaning/purpose ✗, addresses healthcare access ? → Score: 1/5 direct.
- C3 Human nature: Works with self-interest ✓
- C4 Dissenter: Can opt out of receiving it ✓
- C5 Transition: Implementable incrementally ✓
- C6 Evolution: Needs inflation adjustment mechanism, otherwise fragile ?

**Score**: Suffering 1/5, Human nature Yes, Dissenters Yes, Transition Yes, Evolution Partially. Verdict: Good policy, not a utopia — addresses only material suffering.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. Starting with governance instead of suffering. People jump to "what political system?" before asking "what problems must be solved?"
2. Designing for average people. Your utopia must work for the outliers — the disabled, the disagreeable, the eccentric, the lazy, the ambitious.
3. Assuming technology solves values questions. Technology changes what's possible, not what's desirable.
4. Treating utopia as a destination rather than a direction. The procedure produces a snapshot; reality requires continuous iteration.
5. Ignoring the transition as "someone else's problem." A utopia with no path from here is fiction, not vision.

## When to Override This Procedure

- **You're writing fiction**: Skip B7 (human nature check) and B9 (transition) — fiction utopias can explore impossible worlds.
- **You're in a philosophy class**: The procedure is pragmatist. If you need to engage with Rawls, Nozick, or Marx specifically, use their frameworks instead and come back to this for reality-testing.
- **You're doing policy work**: Skip Sections A and D, focus on Section B with scope = your jurisdiction, and add cost modeling.
- **You have domain expertise**: If you're an economist, urban planner, or political scientist, you'll find this procedure oversimplified in your domain. Use it for the domains outside your expertise.

*Validation status: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts.*
