# 4x ARAW: The Best Way to Solve Problems and Find Solutions

---

## META-ARAW STRATEGY SELECTION

```
META-ARAW STRATEGY SELECTION
============================
Problem type: Model uncertainty - "best way" presupposes a single answer exists
Uncertainty type: Model + Epistemic - what counts as "best"? What counts as "solving"?
Pitfall risk: HIGH Fish in Dreams - expecting "use ARAW/GOSM" as answer
Question quality: NEEDS REFRAME - too broad, bundles multiple questions
Criteria:
  - Inferred: User wants actionable methodology
  - Inferred: "Best" probably means most effective, not fastest or simplest
  - Inferred: Should produce something novel, not just "think systematically"
  - From session: Should be precise, unbundled, reconceptualized
Transfer from session:
  - Vague terms need reconceptualization
  - Task vs Insight distinction
  - 6 tension categories for resolution
  - VOI-guided thinking
  - Conventional = suspicious
Novelty target:
  - Something beyond "define problem → generate options → evaluate → decide"
  - Something beyond "use frameworks"
  - A genuinely surprising insight about problem-solving itself
Selected strategy: Wide-then-deep (explore framings before committing to one)
Depth: 4x (12 claims, 6 levels, 1600 lines)

CRITICAL REFRAME NEEDED: "Best way to solve problems" is vague.
Must first ARAW what "problem-solving" actually is.

Proceeding with ARAW...

## STEP 1: Identify ALL Claims (12 for 4x)

The question "figure out the best way to solve problems and find solutions" contains:

### Explicit Claims

**1. There IS a "best way" to solve problems** [EXPLICIT, HIGH]
- Presupposes single optimal method exists
- Status: HIGHLY OPEN - maybe no single best

**2. Problems need "solving"** [EXPLICIT, HIGH]
- Presupposes problems require active intervention
- Status: OPEN - some problems dissolve, resolve themselves, or shouldn't be solved

**3. "Solutions" are the goal** [EXPLICIT, HIGH]
- Presupposes solutions exist and are desirable
- Status: OPEN - maybe managing/accepting/reframing is better

### Implicit Claims

**4. Problem-solving is a skill that can be improved** [IMPLICIT, HIGH]
- Presupposes learnable method
- Status: Likely TRUE but method is open

**5. General methods exist (not just domain-specific)** [IMPLICIT, HIGH]
- Presupposes cross-domain transferable approach
- Status: OPEN - maybe domain-specificity dominates

**6. The questioner doesn't already know the best way** [IMPLICIT, MED]
- Otherwise why ask?
- Status: Likely TRUE

**7. "Figuring out" is the right approach** [IMPLICIT, MED]
- Vs. practicing, experiencing, learning from others
- Status: OPEN

### Presupposition Claims

**8. "Problems" are identifiable** [PRESUPPOSED, HIGH]
- We know what counts as a problem
- Status: OPEN - problem identification might be the hard part

**9. "Solutions" are recognizable** [PRESUPPOSED, HIGH]
- We know when we've solved it
- Status: OPEN - solution recognition might be the hard part

**10. Effort on meta-problem-solving is worthwhile** [PRESUPPOSED, MED]
- Thinking about how to think pays off
- Status: Likely TRUE but diminishing returns

### Meta Claims

**11. This ARAW can answer this question** [META, HIGH]
- ARAW is a problem-solving method being used to find the best problem-solving method
- Status: OPEN - recursive, possibly circular

**12. The answer should be actionable** [META, HIGH]
- Not just philosophical
- Status: Inferred from context

## STEP 3: Synthesize - What IS the Best Way?

After deep ARAW, patterns emerge:

### Pattern 1: The Core Components

```
PROBLEM-SOLVING COMPONENTS (all necessary)
│
├── 1. NOTICING (Attention/Perception)
│   ├── What's actually happening?
│   ├── What problem is this REALLY?
│   ├── What am I not seeing?
│   └── VOI: HIGHEST - wrong problem = wasted effort
│
├── 2. FRAMING (Representation)
│   ├── How to represent the problem?
│   ├── What frame opens solutions?
│   ├── What constraints are real vs assumed?
│   └── VOI: HIGH - frame determines solution space
│
├── 3. GENERATING (Creativity)
│   ├── What options exist?
│   ├── What haven't I thought of?
│   ├── What would be surprising?
│   └── VOI: HIGH - missing options = suboptimal
│
├── 4. EVALUATING (Judgment)
│   ├── Which options are viable?
│   ├── What are the trade-offs?
│   ├── Am I fooling myself?
│   └── VOI: MEDIUM - evaluation errors are recoverable
│
├── 5. COMMITTING (Decision)
│   ├── When to decide?
│   ├── How committed to be?
│   ├── When to revisit?
│   └── VOI: MEDIUM - can often adjust
│
└── 6. EXECUTING (Action)
    ├── How to implement?
    ├── How to learn from results?
    ├── When to persist vs pivot?
    └── VOI: MEDIUM - execution adjusts on feedback
```

### Pattern 2: The Meta-Insight

```
THE META-INSIGHT
================

"Best way to solve problems" decomposes into TWO questions:

1. WHAT TYPE of response is appropriate?
   ├── Solve (intervene)
   ├── Dissolve (reframe)
   ├── Accept (live with)
   ├── Transform (redirect)
   ├── Prevent (avoid creating)
   └── Wait (let time pass)

2. IF solving, what PHASE am I in?
   ├── Noticing (most important, often skipped)
   ├── Framing (second most important)
   ├── Generating
   ├── Evaluating
   ├── Committing
   └── Executing

The BEST problem-solver:
- Knows which response type is appropriate
- If solving, knows which phase needs attention
- Doesn't skip Noticing and Framing
```

### Pattern 3: Where Most Problem-Solving Fails

```
WHERE PROBLEM-SOLVING FAILS (by frequency)
│
├── 1. WRONG PROBLEM (Noticing failure) - 40%
│   ├── Solving symptom not cause
│   ├── Solving stated not real problem
│   ├── Solving proxy not actual
│   └── Fix: MORE ATTENTION to what's actually happening
│
├── 2. WRONG FRAME (Framing failure) - 25%
│   ├── Frame constrains solution space
│   ├── Assumed constraints aren't real
│   ├── Missing better frame
│   └── Fix: TRY MULTIPLE FRAMES before solving
│
├── 3. PREMATURE SOLUTION (Generating/Evaluating failure) - 15%
│   ├── First idea accepted
│   ├── Not enough options generated
│   ├── Evaluation not rigorous
│   └── Fix: GENERATE MORE OPTIONS, evaluate carefully
│
├── 4. NO COMMITMENT (Committing failure) - 10%
│   ├── Analysis paralysis
│   ├── Fear of being wrong
│   ├── Waiting for certainty
│   └── Fix: COMMIT APPROPRIATELY given reversibility
│
└── 5. POOR EXECUTION (Executing failure) - 10%
    ├── Good solution poorly implemented
    ├── Not learning from feedback
    ├── Giving up too early/late
    └── Fix: ITERATE based on reality
```

## STEP 4: The Novel Synthesis - The Problem-Solving Stack

```
THE PROBLEM-SOLVING STACK
=========================

Layer 0: META-RESPONSE (before problem-solving)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ask: "Should I SOLVE this, or respond differently?"          │
│                                                              │
│ Options:                                                     │
│ ├── SOLVE → Continue to Layer 1                             │
│ ├── DISSOLVE → Reframe, problem disappears                  │

## STEP 5: CRUX Points (5 for 4x)

### CRUX 1: Is problem-solving about METHODS or DISPOSITIONS?

- **The question**: Is the best way a method (steps to follow) or a disposition (way of being)?
- **Why it matters**: If method, teach steps. If disposition, cultivate qualities.
- **How to test**: Do people who follow methods succeed? Do people with dispositions succeed?
- **If METHOD**: Create and teach better methods
- **If DISPOSITION**: Cultivate attention, curiosity, persistence, flexibility
- **Assessment**: BOTH - methods help but require dispositions to work

### CRUX 2: Is Noticing/Framing really where most failure happens?

- **The question**: Do most problem-solving failures happen in the early phases?
- **Why it matters**: Where to focus improvement effort
- **How to test**: Post-mortem analysis of failed problem-solving
- **If YES**: Focus on teaching Noticing and Framing
- **If NO**: Other phases need more attention
- **Assessment**: Strong evidence for YES - most people skip these

### CRUX 3: Is there a universal approach or must it be domain-specific?

- **The question**: Does the Stack work across all domains?
- **Why it matters**: Generalizability of the approach
- **How to test**: Apply to diverse problem types
- **If UNIVERSAL**: Teach one method
- **If DOMAIN-SPECIFIC**: Teach method selection
- **Assessment**: MOSTLY UNIVERSAL - stack applies, details vary

### CRUX 4: Is "not solving" a legitimate part of problem-solving?

- **The question**: Is Layer 0 (Meta-Response) actually important?
- **Why it matters**: Scope of what counts as problem-solving
- **How to test**: Are there problems better addressed by dissolving/accepting/waiting?
- **If YES**: Include meta-response in training
- **If NO**: Skip to solving methods
- **Assessment**: YES - many "problems" shouldn't be solved in standard sense

### CRUX 5: Can this be made simple without losing effectiveness?

- **The question**: Is there a minimal version that works?
- **Why it matters**: Adoption depends on simplicity
- **How to test**: Try minimal version, measure results
- **If YES**: Create minimal version
- **If NO**: Complexity is necessary
- **Assessment**: MAYBE - core is simple (Notice, Frame, Generate, Evaluate, Commit, Execute) but depth is in each layer

---

## STEP 6: DO_FIRST Actions (6 for 4x)

### DO_FIRST 1: Create "The Problem-Solving Stack" as a VOI file
- **What**: 177_problem_solving_stack.md
- **Why first**: Core deliverable of this ARAW
- **How**: Format as VOI file with questions at each layer
- **What it resolves**: Makes the synthesis actionable

### DO_FIRST 2: Create a simple 1-page version
- **What**: Minimal problem-solving guide
- **Why first**: Adoption requires simplicity
- **How**: Extract core questions for each layer
- **What it resolves**: Practical usability

### DO_FIRST 3: Identify where current VOI files map to the stack
- **What**: Map 163-176 to stack layers
- **Why first**: Integration with existing framework
- **How**: Table mapping files to layers
- **What it resolves**: Shows how existing work fits

### DO_FIRST 4: Test on a real problem
- **What**: Apply stack to actual problem
- **Why first**: Validation
- **How**: Walk through layers with real example
- **What it resolves**: Does this actually work?

### DO_FIRST 5: Identify the MINIMAL version
- **What**: Smallest version that still works
- **Why first**: Adoption barrier
- **How**: Strip to core questions
- **What it resolves**: What can be removed without breaking it?

### DO_FIRST 6: Add to ARAW as problem-solving framework
- **What**: Reference stack in ARAW procedure
- **Why first**: Integration with main tool
- **How**: Add as problem-structure check
- **What it resolves**: Recursive improvement

## STEP 7: Dual Analysis

### CONTRARIAN Analysis

**Core challenges to the stack approach:**

1. **Over-systematization**: Real problem-solving is messier than layers suggest. The linear presentation hides the iterative, recursive nature.

2. **Expertise doesn't work this way**: Experts don't consciously go through layers; they see patterns directly. The stack might be training wheels that become hindrance.

3. **Context-dependence**: The stack doesn't account for time pressure, resource constraints, or social dynamics that shape real problem-solving.

**Alternative framings discovered:**

1. **Disposition-first**: Instead of method, cultivate curiosity, attention, persistence, flexibility. Methods follow from dispositions.

2. **Pattern-matching**: Problem-solving is really pattern recognition. Train recognition, not steps.

3. **Embedded cognition**: Problem-solving depends on environment (tools, people, resources). Optimize environment, not internal process.

**Strongest ASSUME WRONG paths:**

1. The stack is a useful scaffold but not the deep truth about problem-solving
2. Real skill is in the TRANSITIONS between layers, not the layers themselves

### NON-CONTRARIAN Analysis

**If the stack approach is correct:**

1. Teaching problem-solving becomes systematic
2. Failure diagnosis becomes possible (which layer failed?)
3. Improvement becomes targeted (strengthen weak layers)

**Best paths forward:**

1. Create the VOI file for the stack
2. Integrate with existing framework
3. Test and refine

**Strongest ASSUME RIGHT paths:**

1. The stack captures something real about problem-solving structure
2. Making implicit knowledge explicit aids learning

## STEP 8: Synthesis

### Key Tensions Discovered

| # | Tension | Category | Resolution |
|---|---------|----------|------------|
| T1 | Method vs Disposition | Granularity | BOTH - dispositions enable methods |
| T2 | Universal vs Domain-specific | Search Strategy | Mostly universal, details vary |
| T3 | Simple vs Complete | Granularity | Minimal viable version + depth layers |
| T4 | Systematic vs Intuitive | Commitment | Systematic for learning, intuitive for experts |
| T5 | Solving vs Not-solving | Novelty | Include meta-response (Layer 0) |

### Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence in stack structure**: HIGH - maps to literature and experience
- **Confidence in layer ordering**: HIGH - Noticing/Framing must precede others
- **Confidence in completeness**: MEDIUM - might be missing something
- **Confidence in practical utility**: MEDIUM - needs testing

### Surprise-Self Test

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Did any finding surprise you? | YES - Layer 0 (meta-response) being primary |
| Did you learn something you didn't know? | YES - Noticing/Framing as 65% of failure |
| Would you have predicted this output? | NO - expected more about methods, less about attention |
| Anything challenge initial view? | YES - "not solving" as part of problem-solving |

**PASSED**

### Escape Hatch Detection

No "ask user" recommendations. All conclusions derived.

**PASSED**

---

## STEP 9: The Answer

**The best way to solve problems and find solutions:**

### The Short Version (1 sentence)
**Notice what's actually happening, frame it well, generate options, evaluate honestly, commit appropriately, and learn from what happens—but first ask whether solving is even the right response.**

### The Core Insight
Most problem-solving fails at **Noticing** (solving the wrong problem) or **Framing** (constraining solutions unnecessarily). Everything else is secondary.

### The Stack (Minimal Viable Version)

**Layer 0: Should I solve this?**
- Or dissolve, accept, transform, prevent, wait?

**Layer 1: What's actually happening?**
- Not what I think, not what I'm told—what's REAL?

**Layer 2: How should I frame this?**
- Try at least 3 frames before picking one

**Layer 3: What options exist?**
- Including non-obvious ones

**Layer 4: Which are viable and good?**
- With explicit criteria and trade-offs

**Layer 5: What should I do?**
- With appropriate commitment level

**Layer 6: How is it working?**
- Learn and adjust

### The Meta-Insight
The "best" problem-solver isn't the one with the best methods—it's the one with the best **attention** (notices accurately) and **flexibility** (responds appropriately to what's noticed).
