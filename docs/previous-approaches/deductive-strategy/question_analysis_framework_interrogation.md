# Recursive Interrogation of the Question Analysis Framework

## Level 1: Direct Questions About the Framework

### On the Purpose
- What is this framework?
- Is the framework what it claims to be?
- Does "Transform raw questions into prioritized, actionable analysis" presuppose that transformation is possible?
- Does "minimal guessing" presuppose that guessing can be minimized?
- Is minimal guessing the right goal?
- Is there a goal better than minimal guessing?
- What if the best answers require guessing?
- What if certainty is impossible?
- Does seeking certainty limit what can be discovered?

### On the Classification Dimensions
- Why these five dimensions?
- Are there dimensions I'm missing?
- Is "foundationality" a real property of questions?
- Can foundationality be measured?
- Who determines foundationality?
- Is my judgment of foundationality reliable?
- Does foundationality depend on the goal?
- Foundational for what?
- Foundational for whom?

### On Prior Art
- Does "prior art availability" assume prior art is relevant?
- What if prior art is wrong?
- What if consensus is wrong?
- Is expert consensus reliable?
- How do I know experts are experts?
- What if the question has been mis-framed by prior art?
- Does prior art constrain the solution space?
- Should I ignore prior art to think freshly?
- Or is ignoring prior art arrogance?

### On Verifiability
- Is verifiability itself verifiable?
- What verifies the verification method?
- Is "deductively provable" higher than "empirically testable"?
- Why?
- Is that assumption correct?
- What if empirical testing reveals deductive errors?
- Is coherence weaker than direct verification?
- Can coherence sometimes be stronger?

### On Dependency
- Do questions actually have dependencies?
- Or is dependency a mental model I'm imposing?
- Is the dependency graph a DAG?
- What if there are cycles?
- What if dependency is bidirectional?
- What if A depends on B and B depends on A?
- Does that mean both are unanswerable?
- Or does it mean they must be answered together?

## Level 2: Meta-Questions About the Framework

### On the Framework's Own Status
- Is this framework itself a question?
- Does this framework have foundationality?
- What is this framework's prior art availability?
- Is this framework verifiable?
- Is this framework deductively tractable?
- Where does this framework sit in the dependency graph?
- What questions does THIS framework depend on?
- What questions depend on THIS framework?

### On the Framework's Assumptions
- What does this framework presuppose exists?
  - Questions exist
  - Answers exist
  - Priority exists
  - Foundationality exists
  - Dependencies exist
  - Verification is possible
  - Progress is possible
  - Certainty is achievable (at least partially)

- Are these presuppositions established?
  - Questions exist: Yes (we have files full of them)
  - Answers exist: Assumed but not proven
  - Priority exists: Assumed - but is priority objective or subjective?
  - Foundationality exists: Assumed - major hidden assumption
  - Dependencies exist: Assumed - major hidden assumption
  - Verification is possible: Assumed - depends on epistemology
  - Progress is possible: Assumed - depends on what counts as progress
  - Certainty is achievable: Assumed - major hidden assumption

### On Hidden Limiting Assumptions

**ASSUMPTION 1: Questions have answers**
- What if some questions don't have answers?
- What if some questions are meaningless?
- What if the question dissolves under analysis?
- What if the question IS the answer?

**ASSUMPTION 2: Answers can be ordered by certainty**
- What if certainty is not linear?
- What if certainty is multi-dimensional?
- What if different types of questions have incommensurable certainty types?
- What if "proven" in logic ≠ "proven" in physics ≠ "proven" in ethics?

**ASSUMPTION 3: Foundationality is objective**
- What if foundationality depends on the asker?
- What if foundationality depends on the goal?
- What if different goals invert the foundationality order?
- What if there are multiple valid foundational orderings?

**ASSUMPTION 4: Dependencies form a DAG**
- What if knowledge is holistic, not hierarchical?
- What if coherentism is true instead of foundationalism?
- What if everything depends on everything?
- What if the "roots" are actually derived from the "leaves"?

**ASSUMPTION 5: Prior art is relevant**
- What if the question is new?
- What if prior art frames the question wrong?
- What if prior art has systematic blind spots?
- What if consulting prior art biases the answer?

**ASSUMPTION 6: Analysis methods are valid**
- What validates conceptual analysis?
- What validates presupposition analysis?
- What validates the reversal test?
- Are these methods themselves proven?
- Or are they just "methods we use"?

**ASSUMPTION 7: The goal is answering questions**
- What if the goal is better questions?
- What if the goal is dissolving questions?
- What if the goal is living with questions?
- What if answering is less valuable than asking?

## Level 3: Questions Drawn from Pure Regress Files

Let me check what questions I might be missing by looking at how pure_regress files question:

### From Epistemology Patterns
- Is knowledge possible?
- Is the framework knowledge?
- Does the framework know anything?
- Can frameworks know?
- What would it mean for a framework to know?
- Is the framework true?
- Can frameworks be true?
- Is truth applicable to frameworks?

### From Metaphysics Patterns
- Does this framework exist?
- What is the mode of existence of frameworks?
- Is the framework abstract or concrete?
- Is the framework universal or particular?
- Does the framework have essence?
- What is essential to the framework?
- What is accidental to the framework?
- Can the framework change and remain the same framework?

### From Logic Patterns
- Is the framework consistent?
- Can the framework be complete?
- Is the framework decidable?
- Does the framework refer to itself?
- Is self-reference problematic here?
- Can the framework prove its own validity?
- What would prove the framework invalid?

### From Philosophy of Mind Patterns
- Does the framework require a mind to use it?
- Is the framework mind-dependent?
- Could the framework exist without minds?
- Is the framework subjective or objective?
- Does the framework have meaning?
- Where does the meaning come from?
- Who gives the framework meaning?

### From Ethics Patterns
- Is the framework good?
- Good for what?
- Good for whom?
- Should this framework be used?
- What are the framework's values?
- Does the framework impose values?
- Are the framework's values correct?
- Can values be correct?

## Level 4: Recursive Application

Now applying the framework TO the framework:

### Foundationality of the Framework
- The framework depends on: epistemology, logic, philosophy of language
- These are themselves massive question domains
- The framework is NOT a root - it's highly dependent
- This is a problem: I'm using a dependent framework to find roots

### Prior Art for the Framework
- Philosophy of science: methodology literature
- Epistemology: foundationalism vs coherentism debate
- Logic: proof theory, formal systems
- Prior art exists but is contested
- No consensus on the right methodology for methodology

### Verifiability of the Framework
- Can I verify the framework works?
- Only by using it and checking results
- But how do I check results without already having a framework?
- Circular verification problem

### Deductive Tractability
- The framework cannot be deduced from nothing
- It requires substantial assumptions
- Many of those assumptions are contested
- The framework is NOT deductively tractable

### Dependency Position
- The framework is a HUB (many things depend on it)
- But the framework also DEPENDS on many things
- This is concerning: a hub that depends on much is unstable

## Level 5: What the Framework is Missing

### Missing Dimensions

1. **Urgency**: How time-sensitive is answering this question?
2. **Actionability**: Does answering this question change what we do?
3. **Scope**: How many situations does this question apply to?
4. **Reversibility**: If we answer wrong, can we correct it?
5. **Cost of Error**: What happens if we get this wrong?
6. **Tractability to This Agent**: Can I specifically answer this, or is it beyond me?

### Missing Methods

1. **Dissolution**: Not answering the question but showing it's malformed
2. **Reframing**: Replacing the question with a better question
3. **Empirical Testing**: Actually testing rather than just analyzing
4. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Who cares about this question and why?
5. **Scenario Analysis**: What if different answers were true?
6. **Negative Analysis**: What would prove the question unanswerable?

### Missing Considerations

1. **The framework assumes Western analytic philosophy approach**
   - What about pragmatist approaches? (Does it work?)
   - What about phenomenological approaches? (What is the lived experience?)
   - What about dialectical approaches? (What emerges from contradiction?)

2. **The framework assumes individual analysis**
   - What about collective inquiry?
   - What about adversarial collaboration?
   - What about wisdom traditions?

3. **The framework assumes analysis leads to answers**
   - What about aporia? (Productive confusion)
   - What about negative capability? (Remaining in uncertainty)
   - What about the Socratic endpoint? (Knowing that we don't know)

## Level 6: The Deepest Limiting Assumption

**THE FRAMEWORK ASSUMES THAT ANSWERING QUESTIONS IS THE GOAL**

But your original goal was: **Deductive Strategy Selection**

Questions are tools FOR strategy selection, not ends in themselves.

The real questions might be:
- What strategies are available?
- What makes a strategy necessary vs merely possible?
- What logical structure would make a strategy DEDUCIBLE rather than chosen?
- Is deductive strategy selection possible?
- What would make it possible?
- What would make it impossible?

The framework should be evaluated against THIS goal, not against "answering philosophical questions."

## Level 7: Revised Framework Considerations

If the goal is deductive strategy selection:

1. **Relevant questions are those that constrain strategy space**
   - Not "What is justice?" but "What must a strategy do to satisfy justice constraints?"
   - Not "What is causation?" but "What causal assumptions does this strategy make?"

2. **Foundationality is goal-relative**
   - Foundational = "Answers to this question eliminate or mandate strategies"
   - Not foundational in general, foundational for strategy derivation

3. **Prior art is about proven strategies**
   - Not philosophical literature
   - But: What strategies have been proven to work? Why? Under what conditions?

4. **Verification is about strategy success**
   - Can the strategy be tested?
   - Has the strategy been tested?
   - What would falsify the strategy?

5. **The real dependency graph is about strategy implications**
   - If I adopt strategy A, what else am I committed to?
   - If I reject strategy B, what options remain?

## Summary of Hidden Limiting Assumptions

1. **Questions are ends** → Should be: Questions are instruments for strategy derivation
2. **Foundationality is objective** → Should be: Foundationality is goal-relative
3. **Prior art means philosophy** → Should be: Prior art means proven strategies
4. **Verification means epistemology** → Should be: Verification means strategy testing
5. **Dependencies are conceptual** → Should be: Dependencies are strategic implications
6. **Western analytic method assumed** → Should consider: pragmatic, empirical, dialectical
7. **Individual analysis assumed** → Should consider: collective, adversarial, traditional
8. **Certainty is achievable** → May need to accept: decision under uncertainty

## Next Step

Revise the framework to be explicitly oriented toward deductive strategy selection, not philosophical question-answering.
