## Using This Rotation

1. At the start of each week, note which question is current
2. During weekly review, spend 5-10 minutes genuinely engaging with the question
3. Write down thoughts, even if incomplete
4. Note any implications for action
5. If a question doesn't resonate, note why and adapt
6. After 24 weeks, review patterns in answers and update rotation if needed

## Customizing

- Add questions that repeatedly prove useful
- Remove questions that consistently don't resonate
- Adjust timing (some questions might warrant monthly rather than weekly)
- Add domain-specific questions for active goals

## Tracking

| Week | Question | Key Insight | Action Taken |
