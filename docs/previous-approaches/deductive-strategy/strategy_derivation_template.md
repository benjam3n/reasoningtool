Use this template to derive a strategy from a goal through systematic constraint application.

Goal: _______________
Date: _______________

## Phase 1: Situation Analysis

### Current State (Observable, Specific)

What is true right now? (Be concrete, not vague)

| Domain | Current State | How I Know |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Physical/Material | | |
| Social/Relational | | |
| Mental/Psychological | | |
| Resources (time/money/energy) | | |
| Skills/Capabilities | | |
| Environment | | |

### Goal State (Observable, Specific)

What would success look like? (Specific enough to verify)

| Dimension | Target State | How I'd Verify |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

Timeline: _______________
Why this timeline: _______________

### Resources Available

| Resource Type | Amount/Quality | Flexibility |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Time | | |
| Money | | |
| Energy/Willpower | | |
| Social support | | |
| Skills | | |
| Tools/Equipment | | |

### Must NOT Change (Preservation Constraints)

What must be protected during pursuit of this goal?
-
-
-

### Cannot Control (External Factors)

What's outside my influence that affects this goal?
-
-
-

## Phase 2: Constraint Identification

### Logical Constraints

What's logically impossible given this goal?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Physical Constraints

What's physically impossible given the situation?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Resource Constraints

What's impossible given available resources?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Temporal Constraints

What's impossible given the timeline?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Normative Constraints

What would violate my values or commitments?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Summary of All Constraints

A valid strategy must:
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

A valid strategy must NOT:
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

## Phase 3: Strategy Enumeration

### Initial Strategy Space

List all strategies you can think of (don't filter yet):

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

### Applying Constraints

For each strategy, check against constraints:

| Strategy | Violates Constraint? | Survives? |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1. | | Y/N |
| 2. | | Y/N |
| 3. | | Y/N |
| 4. | | Y/N |
| 5. | | Y/N |
| 6. | | Y/N |
| 7. | | Y/N |
| 8. | | Y/N |
| 9. | | Y/N |
| 10. | | Y/N |

### Surviving Strategies

List strategies that weren't eliminated:

1.
2.
3.

---

## Phase 4: Uniqueness Check

How many strategies survive?

- [ ] Zero - Goal may be impossible. Go to Phase 4a.
- [ ] One - Strategy is derived. Go to Phase 6.
- [ ] Multiple - Need additional constraints. Go to Phase 5.

### Phase 4a: If Zero Strategies

The goal cannot be achieved under current constraints.

Options:
1. **Relax a constraint** - Which constraint could be loosened?
2. **Change the goal** - What related goal is achievable?
3. **Change the timeline** - Would more time help?
4. **Acquire resources** - What's needed that's not available?

Decision: _______________

## Phase 5: Additional Constraint Search

Multiple strategies survive. Need to find distinguishing constraints.

### What Distinguishes Remaining Strategies?

| Strategy A | Strategy B | Difference |
|------------|------------|------------|
| | | |

### Search for Constraints on the Difference

Questions:
- Is there evidence one approach works better?
- Is there a cost difference?
- Is there a risk difference?
- Is one more aligned with my values/strengths?
- Does prior art favor one?

| Distinguishing Factor | Finding | Eliminates? |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------|
| | | |
| | | |

### After Additional Constraints

Strategies now remaining:

1.

If multiple still remain:
- [ ] They may be genuinely equivalent → choose based on preference
- [ ] There may be constraints I haven't identified → keep searching
- [ ] There may be genuine optionality → document it

## Phase 6: Derivation Documentation

### The Derived Strategy

**Strategy name:** _______________

**Core approach:**


**Key components:**
1.
2.
3.

### Premises Used

List all facts, assumptions, and constraints that led to this strategy:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Reasoning Chain

How do the premises lead to this strategy?

```
Premise 1:
Premise 2:
∴ Conclusion 1:

Premise 3:
Conclusion 1:
∴ Conclusion 2:

[Continue as needed]

Final: Therefore, the strategy is...
```

### Confidence Level

What's the certainty level of this derivation?

- [ ] **Logically Derived (1.0)** - Follows necessarily from verified premises
- [ ] **Empirically Derived (0.9)** - Premises empirically supported, reasoning valid
- [ ] **Prior Art Derived (0.7)** - Matches what works in similar situations
- [ ] **Analytically Derived (0.5)** - Premises plausible but unverified
- [ ] **Heuristically Selected (0.3)** - Based on rules of thumb
- [ ] **Guessed (0.1)** - No systematic derivation

### Assumptions That Could Be Wrong

List assumptions that, if wrong, would invalidate the strategy:
