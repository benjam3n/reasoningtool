# Goal Decomposition Methodology: From Abstract to Specific With Nuance

How to break down high-level goals into actionable components without losing important information.

## The Problem With Naive Decomposition

### Example: "Make The World A Better Place"

Naive decomposition:
- Make people happier
- Make more people happy
- Make people happy for longer

This loses almost everything:
- What does "better" actually mean?
- Better for whom?
- Better in what dimension?
- At what cost?
- Over what timeframe?
- Compared to what baseline?
- Who decides what counts as better?

### Why Naive Decomposition Fails

1. **Collapses multiple dimensions into one** - "Better" has many aspects; "happier" is just one
2. **Ignores tradeoffs** - Making some people happier might make others worse off
3. **Loses constraints** - No consideration of what's possible or ethical
4. **Hides value judgments** - Implicitly chooses what matters without making it explicit
5. **Produces unmeasurable goals** - "Happier" can't be tracked
6. **Enables rationalization** - Vague goals justify anything

## The Decomposition Process

### Phase 1: What Does The Goal Actually Mean?

Before decomposing, understand what you're decomposing.

#### Step 1.1: Identify All Dimensions

What aspects does this goal touch?

For "make the world better":
- Material wellbeing (resources, health, security)
- Psychological wellbeing (happiness, meaning, satisfaction)
- Social wellbeing (relationships, community, belonging)
- Freedom (autonomy, options, self-determination)
- Justice (fairness, equality, rights)
- Knowledge (understanding, truth, wisdom)
- Beauty (aesthetics, art, nature)
- Virtue (character, ethics, integrity)
- Sustainability (long-term, future generations)

Don't collapse prematurely. "Better" means all of these, not just "happier."

#### Step 1.2: Identify Whose Perspective

Better for whom?

- Yourself
- People you know
- Your community
- Your nation
- Humanity
- Future generations
- Non-human animals
- Life in general
- Abstract values

These can conflict. Being explicit about scope matters.

#### Step 1.3: Identify Timeframe

Better when?

- Immediately
- Short-term (months)
- Medium-term (years)
- Long-term (decades)
- Indefinite future

Short-term and long-term often conflict.

#### Step 1.4: Identify Constraints

What limits the goal?

- Physical constraints (laws of nature, resource limits)
- Ethical constraints (what you won't do even for the goal)
- Practical constraints (your capabilities, position, resources)
- Knowledge constraints (what's known about how to achieve it)
- Social constraints (what others will accept or resist)

#### Step 1.5: Write The Expanded Definition

Take the abstract goal and write out what it actually means given the above.

"Make the world a better place" might become:

"Improve material, psychological, and social wellbeing for as many people as possible, with particular attention to those worst off, while respecting human freedom and justice, in ways that are sustainable long-term, without causing harm to achieve short-term gains, within my actual capabilities and resources."

This is much more specific than the original.

### Phase 2: Identify Subgoals

Now decompose - but carefully.

#### Step 2.1: Derive Subgoals From Dimensions

For each dimension identified, what would it mean to advance it?

Material wellbeing:
- Reduce poverty
- Improve health outcomes
- Increase security
- Provide basic needs

Psychological wellbeing:
- Reduce suffering
- Increase meaning and purpose
- Enable satisfaction with life
- Support mental health

Social wellbeing:
- Strengthen relationships
- Build community
- Enable belonging
- Reduce isolation

Freedom:
- Expand options
- Protect autonomy
- Remove coercion
- Enable self-determination

Justice:
- Reduce unfairness
- Protect rights
- Enable equality of opportunity
- Address systemic wrongs

(Continue for all dimensions)

#### Step 2.2: Identify Subgoal Dependencies

Which subgoals enable or block others?

- Material wellbeing enables psychological wellbeing (hard to be happy while starving)
- Freedom enables material wellbeing (autonomy allows pursuit of resources)
- Justice enables sustainability (unfair systems get overthrown)
- Knowledge enables everything (can't improve what you don't understand)

Map these relationships. Some subgoals are foundational.

#### Step 2.3: Identify Subgoal Conflicts

Which subgoals trade off against each other?

- Short-term happiness vs long-term wellbeing (pleasure now vs health later)
- Individual freedom vs collective outcomes (autonomy vs coordination)
- Local benefit vs global fairness (help your community vs help strangers)
- Current generations vs future generations (consume now vs preserve)
- Efficiency vs resilience (optimize vs diversify)

Be explicit about these. Naive decomposition hides them.

#### Step 2.4: Write Subgoal Relationships

Document:
- What enables what
- What conflicts with what
- What is foundational
- What is downstream

This creates a graph, not a list.

### Phase 3: Prioritize Subgoals

Not all subgoals are equal. How to prioritize.

#### Step 3.1: Apply The Prioritization Criteria

From Part 35 of the foundational derivation:

For each subgoal, assess:
- **Ease** - How hard to advance this?
- **Ethics** - How clearly good is advancing this?
- **Accessibility** - Can you actually work on this?
- **Amplification** - Does this enable other subgoals?
- **Overlooked** - Is this underserved by others?
- **Probability** - How likely to succeed?
- **Impact** - How much does advancing this matter?

#### Step 3.2: Weight By Dependencies

Foundational subgoals (that enable others) get priority.

If knowledge enables everything, advancing knowledge might be highest priority.
If justice enables sustainability, justice might come before sustainability.

#### Step 3.3: Account For Conflicts

When subgoals conflict, decide:
- Which matters more? (value judgment)
- Can the conflict be mitigated? (creative solution)
- At what cost is each achievable? (practical reality)
- What's the acceptable tradeoff? (explicit choice)

Document these decisions. They're part of the plan.

#### Step 3.4: Consider Comparative Advantage

Where can YOU specifically contribute?

- What do you know that others don't?
- What can you do that others can't?
- What position do you have that's unique?
- Where is your effort unusually valuable?

Priority = importance × your ability to contribute.

---

### Phase 4: Specify Action-Level Goals

Now translate subgoals to concrete actions.

#### Step 4.1: For Each Prioritized Subgoal

Ask: What would I actually DO to advance this?

"Reduce poverty" →
- Donate to effective charities
- Build businesses that employ people
- Advocate for better policies
- Develop technologies that reduce costs
- Etc.

These are still choices. Different approaches to the same subgoal.

#### Step 4.2: Apply Constraints

Filter actions by:
- Can I actually do this? (capability)
- Do I have the resources? (practical)
- Is it ethical? (constraint)
- Does it conflict with other actions? (coordination)
- What's the realistic impact? (effectiveness)

#### Step 4.3: Sequence Actions

Some actions must happen in order:
- Build capability before deploying it
- Gather information before acting on it
- Establish trust before collaborating

Map the sequence.

#### Step 4.4: Define Success Criteria

For each action:
- What would success look like?
- How would you know you've succeeded?
- What's the minimum viable outcome?
- What's the stretch goal?

Make it concrete and measurable where possible.

## Worked Example: "Address Wealth Inequality"

### Phase 1: What Does It Mean?

**Dimensions:**
- Material (money, assets, resources)
- Opportunity (access to education, jobs, capital)
- Power (political influence, voice)
- Dignity (respect, status, treatment)

**Whose perspective:**
- Those with less wealth (primary)
- Society as a whole (systemic)
- Future generations (sustainability)

**Timeframe:**
- Immediate relief (now)
- Structural change (years-decades)
- Long-term equilibrium (indefinite)

**Constraints:**
- Can't violate property rights in ways that undermine incentives
- Can't impose solutions top-down without consent
- Limited by political feasibility
- Limited by my own position and resources

**Expanded definition:**
"Reduce the gap between those with most and least material resources, increase opportunity access for those currently excluded, shift political power toward the less powerful, and increase dignity for those currently disrespected, in ways that are sustainable and don't undermine the economic systems that generate wealth to distribute."

### Phase 2: Subgoals

**Material:**
- Increase income for lowest earners
- Reduce extreme poverty
- Provide basic needs (housing, food, healthcare)
- Build wealth (not just income) for those without

**Opportunity:**
- Improve education access
- Expand job opportunities
- Provide capital access (credit, investment)
- Reduce barriers to entry

**Power:**
- Increase political participation by poor
- Reduce influence of concentrated wealth
- Enable collective bargaining
- Support democratic institutions

**Dignity:**
- Reduce stigma around poverty
- Improve treatment in systems (legal, medical, etc.)
- Enable self-determination
- Build respect for all work

**Dependencies:**
- Basic needs enable opportunity pursuit
- Opportunity enables material improvement
- Power enables structural change
- Dignity enables psychological wellbeing

**Conflicts:**
- Immediate redistribution vs long-term growth
- Individual solutions vs systemic change
- Local focus vs global fairness
- Fast change vs sustainable change

### Phase 3: Prioritize

**Applying criteria:**

| Subgoal | Ease | Ethics | Access | Amplify | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Reduce extreme poverty | Medium | High | Medium | High | High |
| Improve education access | Hard | High | Medium | Very High | High |
| Reduce concentrated power | Very Hard | High | Low | Very High | Very High |
| Increase dignity | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | Medium |

**My comparative advantage (hypothetical):**
- Tech background → could build tools
- Analytical skills → could research and clarify
- Some resources → could donate or invest
- Limited political power → not positioned for policy change

**Priority sequence:**
1. Research and clarify (use analytical skills)
2. Build/support tools that increase opportunity (use tech skills)
3. Donate/invest effectively (use resources)
4. Advocate within sphere of influence (use position)

### Phase 4: Concrete Actions

**For "research and clarify":**
- Read existing literature on what works (1 month)
- Identify highest-impact interventions (analysis)
- Write up findings (documentation)
- Success: Have clear view of what's actually effective

**For "build/support tools":**
- Identify specific tools that would help (research)
- Evaluate whether I could build vs support existing (capability assessment)
- Choose specific project (decision)
- Execute (building or supporting)
- Success: Tool exists and is used by target population

**For "donate/invest":**
- Identify high-impact opportunities (research)
- Allocate resources (decision)
- Track outcomes (monitoring)
- Success: Resources directed to effective use

## Common Traps And How To Avoid Them

### Trap 1: Stopping At Slogans

"Address inequality" is a slogan, not a goal.
"Increase income for bottom quintile by 10% through X mechanism" is a goal.

**Fix:** Keep decomposing until you have something you could actually measure and act on.

### Trap 2: Hiding Value Judgments

Choosing "happiness" over "freedom" is a value judgment, not an obvious truth.

**Fix:** Make every value judgment explicit. Write it down. Justify it.

### Trap 3: Ignoring Conflicts

Pretending there are no tradeoffs makes them invisible, not resolved.

**Fix:** Actively look for conflicts. Document them. Decide how to handle them.

### Trap 4: Confusing Levels

"Make the world better" and "donate $100 to charity" are different levels. Don't treat them the same.

**Fix:** Keep levels explicit. Know which level you're operating at.

### Trap 5: Forgetting Constraints

The perfect decomposition that's impossible to execute is worthless.

**Fix:** Apply constraints at every level. Filter for what's actually achievable.

### Trap 6: Losing The Whole

Getting so focused on subgoals that you forget the original goal.

**Fix:** Regularly check: do the subgoals actually add up to the original goal?

### Trap 7: Analysis Paralysis

Decomposing forever instead of acting.

**Fix:** Good enough decomposition executed beats perfect decomposition never started.

## How This Connects To GOSM

### Goal Definition Phase (Step 2)

GOSM's goal definition should use this methodology:
- Expand abstract goals before committing
- Identify dimensions, scope, timeframe, constraints
- Decompose into subgoals with explicit relationships
- Prioritize based on criteria
- Specify action-level goals with success criteria

### Context Assessment (Step 3)

The decomposition informs context:
- What constraints apply?
- What dependencies exist?
- What tradeoffs are relevant?

### Strategy Generation (Step 9)

Strategies should connect to specific subgoals:
- Which subgoal does this strategy advance?
- How does it handle tradeoffs?
- What's the expected impact?

### Review (Ongoing)

Reviews should check decomposition validity:
- Are the subgoals still right?
- Have tradeoffs shifted?
- Is anything missing?

## The Key Principle

**Decomposition should preserve information, not destroy it.**

The abstract goal contains information about what matters. Decomposition should unpack that information, make it explicit, and maintain it through to action.

If your decomposition loses nuance, loses tradeoffs, hides conflicts, or enables rationalization - it's bad decomposition.

Good decomposition: you can trace from any action back to why it serves the original goal, through explicit reasoning, without hidden assumptions.
