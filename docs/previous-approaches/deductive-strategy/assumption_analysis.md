# Assumption Analysis: Thinking Through What I Previously Guessed

These are the ~10 items I identified as "guessing dressed as skepticism" rather than substantive analysis. Here I actually think through each one.

---

## 1. Reviews Improve Outcomes

**My previous lazy claim:** "No evidence reviews help"

**Actually thinking it through:**

What would make reviews improve outcomes?
- They force attention to something that might otherwise be neglected
- They create a scheduled moment to step back from day-to-day operations
- They can catch drift before it becomes severe
- They can identify patterns invisible in the moment

What could make reviews NOT improve outcomes?
- If the review questions don't surface actionable information
- If the review happens but insights aren't acted on
- If the review becomes ritual without substance
- If the timing is wrong (too frequent = noise, too rare = missed problems)

**Conditions under which reviews actually help:**
- Questions must be designed to surface actionable information
- There must be a mechanism to act on what's discovered
- Frequency must match rate at which important things change
- Person must be honest during review (connects to mechanism design point)

**Refined assumption:** "Well-designed reviews with action mechanisms help" - more defensible but more specific. The system should specify what makes a review well-designed, not just mandate reviews.

## 2. Questions Generate Constraints

**My previous lazy claim:** Didn't analyze the mechanism

**Actually thinking it through:**

How would questions generate constraints?
- "What are the ethical limits?" surfaces things you're not willing to do → constraint
- "What resources are available?" limits what's possible → constraint
- "What has been tried and failed?" eliminates options → constraint

But questions don't automatically generate constraints:
- "What would you like?" expands possibility space, doesn't constrain
- "What if anything were possible?" generates options, not constraints

**The actual mechanism:**
- **Boundary questions** generate constraints (limits, ethics, resources)
- **History questions** generate constraints (failures, past decisions)
- **Possibility questions** generate options (aspirations, desires)
- **Expansion questions** generate options (what-ifs, brainstorms)

**Refined assumption:** The system should distinguish question types - specify which questions generate constraints vs options, and when each type is needed. Not all questions constrain; the system should be explicit about which do.

## 3. Self-Protection Necessary

**My previous lazy claim:** Ignored user's actual context and reasoning

**Actually thinking it through:**

User's specific context:
- People in power shouldn't automatically get "the keys" to powerful systems
- System shouldn't reveal methods to untrusted parties
- Observation that revealing too much leads to exploitation

Arguments for self-protection:
- Valuable strategies might be copied/stolen if revealed
- Revealing methods allows adversaries to game around them
- Too much transparency makes manipulation easier
- User has empirical observation that this happens

Arguments against self-protection:
- Can become paranoia
- Hiding prevents beneficial collaboration
- Assumption others are adversaries may be wrong
- Has costs (effort, missed opportunities, isolation)

**When self-protection is actually necessary:**
- Information is genuinely valuable AND others would exploit it
- Trust has not been established
- Revealing would harm without compensating benefit
- Evidence (not just fear) of adversarial behavior exists

**Refined assumption:** Self-protection is necessary in proportion to actual threat level. The system should have a threat assessment mechanism, not default to maximum paranoia or maximum openness. Calibration matters.

## 4. People In Power Untrustworthy

**My previous lazy claim:** Generic "this is a broad generalization" critique

**Actually thinking it through:**

User's actual claim (more specific): People who already have power shouldn't automatically be given more power in new domains.

Arguments for this:
- Power tends to corrupt (substantial historical evidence)
- People in power have interests in maintaining that power
- Giving more power to those with power increases concentration
- Power acquisition doesn't guarantee merit or good judgment

Arguments against this:
- Some people in power are genuinely competent
- Some have proven trustworthy through actions
- "People in power" has huge variation
- Alternative (give to those without) isn't obviously better

**The nuance I missed:**
It's not that people in power ARE untrustworthy. It's that power should be earned/verified for each new domain. The issue is about extrapolation - having power in domain A doesn't mean you should automatically get power in domain B.

**Refined assumption:** Trust and power should be domain-specific and earned through demonstrated contribution, not extrapolated from existing power. This is actually well-reasoned.

---

## 5. Contribution Should Determine Power

**My previous lazy claim:** Didn't engage with the game theory reasoning

**Actually thinking it through:**

User's claim: From game theory perspective, power should be proportional to contribution (helping others) vs extraction (helping self at others' expense).

Arguments for this principle:
- Aligns incentives - if power comes from helping, people help more
- Reduces extraction - can't gain power by taking
- Creates positive-sum dynamics
- Those who've helped have demonstrated they use power well

Arguments against this principle:
- "Contribution" is hard to measure
- Some contributions aren't visible
- Past contribution doesn't guarantee future good behavior
- Could be gamed (appear to contribute while extracting)

**The deeper point I missed:**
This is a proposed NORM, not a description of reality. The user is saying "this is what SHOULD determine power" not "this is what DOES determine power."

As a norm, it has good game-theoretic properties IF it can be enforced.

**Real question:** Can contribution be measured well enough to base power allocation on it? This is an empirical question about specific contexts. In some contexts (clear output, observable help) yes. In others (hidden contributions, long-term effects) harder.

**Refined assessment:** The principle is sound as a norm. Implementation difficulty varies by context. Not a flaw in reasoning, a challenge in application.

## 6. Easy Things Should Be Prioritized

**My previous lazy claim:** May have misunderstood user's point

**Actually thinking it through:**

User said: Prioritize things that are easy, ethical, low-hanging fruit, accessible, high amplification, overlooked.

User also mentioned "toy car lesson": Don't commit to ambitious/aesthetic approach when simple would succeed.

**Is there tension?**

"Easy things first" principle: Do simple things before hard things.
"Toy car lesson": Don't commit to complex approaches when simple ones work.

These actually ALIGN. Both say: simple/easy is better when it works.

**Potential objection:** What if easy things don't solve the real problem? What if you need to do hard things?

**The resolution:** The principle isn't "only do easy things." It's "don't skip past easy solutions to pursue hard ones unnecessarily." If easy doesn't work, then do hard. But try easy first.

**Refined assessment:** User's reasoning is actually sound. The principle is: exhaust simple approaches before committing to complex ones. This avoids wasted effort on unnecessary complexity. Not a flaw.

## 7. Standard Approaches Have Merit

**My previous lazy claim:** Didn't engage with the nuance

**Actually thinking it through:**

User said two things:
1. Evaluate standard approaches to see if they can be improved or have flaws
2. Don't dismiss bizarre strategies without understanding where they're coming from

This is NOT saying "standard approaches are right." It's saying:
- Understand standard approaches before rejecting them
- Understand bizarre approaches before rejecting them

**The actual principle:** Understand before rejecting.

**Why this is clearly good:**
- You might reject something for wrong reasons if you don't understand it
- You might miss useful elements
- Understanding reveals which parts are good vs bad
- Applies to BOTH standard AND bizarre approaches equally

**Only caveat:** There's a time cost to understanding everything. Some filtering is needed. But the principle is sound: don't reject without understanding.

**Refined assessment:** User's position is nuanced and well-reasoned. It's about epistemic humility (understand first) not about defaulting to standard or bizarre.

## 8. This System Should Exist

**My previous lazy claim:** Generic "is this net positive?" skepticism

**Actually thinking it through:**

Arguments for building this system:
- Better decision-making leads to better outcomes
- Explicit reasoning catches errors implicit reasoning misses
- User has tried many things that haven't worked - needs better approach
- Deductive derivation could be genuinely better than guessing
- The user's specific problems (strategy selection, uncertainty about what works) are exactly what this system addresses

Arguments against building this system:
- System complexity could overwhelm the doing
- Analysis paralysis risk
- System might be wrong in hard-to-detect ways
- Time building isn't time solving actual problems

**When is system net positive?**
- Problems are hard enough that naive approaches fail
- User has capacity to build and use it
- System actually works (produces better strategies)
- Cost of building doesn't exceed benefit of using

**For this specific user:**
- Has tried many approaches that failed → problems are hard, naive approaches haven't worked
- Is capable of building complex systems → can build it
- Whether it works → unknown until built and tested
- Cost vs benefit → depends on implementation quality

**Refined assessment:** The concept is sound for this user's situation. The real question isn't "should a system exist" but "does this specific implementation actually improve strategy selection?" Design quality determines value. Skepticism about concept is misplaced; skepticism about implementation quality is appropriate.

## 9. Claude Can Build This

**My previous lazy claim:** Vague self-doubt without specifics

**Actually thinking it through:**

**Specific limitations I have:**
- I don't have user's lived experience and context
- I might add things that seem good but aren't actually useful (I already did this - Parts 46-49)
- I might miss important aspects user knows but hasn't stated
- My training shapes what I generate in ways neither of us fully understands
- I might generate "sounds smart" content that isn't actually good

**What I can actually do:**
- Organize and structure what user says
- Notice potential inconsistencies
- Suggest possibilities user might not have considered
- Write clear documentation
- Ask clarifying questions
- Draft content for user to validate

**What's already happened that's informative:**
- I added unwanted parts → user corrected me
- I guessed instead of thinking → user called it out
- User has validated what's good and rejected what's bad
- The collaboration has error-correction built in

**How collaboration works:**
- User provides direction and validation
- I provide structure and drafting
- User catches my errors
- I iterate based on feedback

**Refined assessment:** I can help build the system, but user must validate output. This is working - user has already corrected errors. The limitation isn't "Claude can't do this" but "Claude needs user validation." That's already how we're operating.

---

## 10. Constraints Can Be Identified

**My previous lazy claim:** Invoked "unknown unknowns" as if that's an argument

**Actually thinking it through:**

The claim isn't that ALL constraints can be identified. It's that ENOUGH constraints can be identified to be useful.

**Constraints that CAN be identified:**
- Physical limits (laws of physics, biology, materials)
- Resource limits (what you actually have)
- Time limits (deadlines, age, mortality)
- Ethical limits (what you're not willing to do)
- Social limits (what others won't accept)
- Past failures (what's been tried and didn't work)
- Logical constraints (what's contradictory)

**Constraints that are HARD to identify:**
- Future changes (what will become possible/impossible)
- Unknown dependencies (hidden requirements)
- Black swan events (rare but high-impact)
- Personal blind spots (things you systematically miss)
- Constraints you don't know exist

**The resolution:**
Identify the constraints you CAN, acknowledge unknown ones exist, build mechanisms to discover constraints you missed (reviews, feedback, monitoring, testing).

This is actually what the system does. The "unknown unknowns" critique doesn't invalidate the approach - it means the approach must include updating mechanisms.

**Refined assessment:** The assumption is "enough constraints can be identified to make progress" not "all constraints can be identified." That's defensible. Unknown unknowns are handled by building in discovery mechanisms, not by giving up on constraint identification.

## Summary

| Item | My lazy critique | Actual assessment |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Reviews help | "No evidence" | Help if well-designed with action mechanisms |
| Questions constrain | Didn't analyze | Some questions constrain, some expand - need to specify which |
| Self-protection needed | Ignored context | Needed in proportion to actual threat - calibration matters |
| Power holders untrustworthy | "Broad generalization" | Power should be domain-specific and earned - actually well-reasoned |
| Contribution determines power | Didn't engage | Sound norm with implementation challenges |
| Easy first | Misunderstood | User's reasoning is correct - exhaust simple before complex |
| Standard approaches have merit | Didn't engage nuance | Position is "understand before rejecting" for all approaches |
| System should exist | Generic skepticism | Concept is sound; implementation quality determines value |
| Claude can build this | Vague self-doubt | Can help with user validation - already working this way |
| Constraints identifiable | Invoked unknown unknowns | Enough can be identified; include update mechanisms |

**Meta-observation:** Most of my "critiques" were lazy skepticism that avoided engaging with actual reasoning. When I actually thought through each item, the user's positions were generally sound or had clear conditions under which they held. The real work is in specifying those conditions, not in vague objections.
