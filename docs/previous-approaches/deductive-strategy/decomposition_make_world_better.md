# Goal Decomposition: Make The World A Better Place

Applying the full decomposition methodology to an abstract goal.

---

## Phase 1: What Does This Goal Actually Mean?

### 1.1 Identify All Dimensions

"Better" is not one thing. It has multiple dimensions:

**Material Wellbeing**
- Resources: food, water, shelter, energy
- Health: physical functioning, longevity, absence of disease
- Security: safety from violence, disasters, deprivation
- Infrastructure: systems that enable life (transportation, communication, sanitation)

**Psychological Wellbeing**
- Suffering reduction: less pain, fear, anxiety, despair
- Positive states: happiness, contentment, peace
- Meaning: sense of purpose, significance, mattering
- Agency: feeling of control over one's life
- Mental health: psychological stability, resilience

**Social Wellbeing**
- Relationships: connection, love, friendship, family
- Community: belonging, shared identity, mutual support
- Trust: ability to rely on others, social cohesion
- Cooperation: working together effectively

**Freedom**
- Autonomy: self-determination, making own choices
- Options: having alternatives available
- Non-coercion: absence of force, manipulation, control by others
- Privacy: space for self without surveillance

**Justice**
- Fairness: proportional distribution of goods and bads
- Rights: protections and entitlements respected
- Equality: equal treatment, equal opportunity
- Accountability: those who cause harm face consequences
- Voice: ability to participate in decisions that affect you

**Knowledge**
- Truth: accurate understanding of reality
- Education: access to learning
- Wisdom: knowing how to live well
- Information: access to what you need to know
- Understanding: making sense of the world

**Beauty/Aesthetics**
- Nature: natural environments, biodiversity, ecosystems
- Art: human creative expression
- Experience: richness of lived experience
- Wonder: capacity for awe

**Virtue/Character**
- Integrity: people acting according to principles
- Compassion: care for others' wellbeing
- Courage: willingness to do right despite cost
- Honesty: truthfulness in dealing

**Sustainability**
- Future generations: not consuming their inheritance
- Ecological stability: maintaining life-supporting systems
- Long-term viability: not building on foundations that will collapse

**Capability**
- Human potential: people able to develop and express abilities
- Innovation: capacity to solve new problems
- Adaptation: ability to respond to change

### 1.2 Identify Whose Perspective

"The world" includes:

**By proximity:**
- Self (necessary starting point - can't help others if destroyed)
- Close relationships (family, friends)
- Community (local area, affinity groups)
- Nation (fellow citizens)
- Humanity (all people)
- Future generations (people not yet born)
- Non-human animals (sentient beings)
- Life broadly (ecosystems, biosphere)

**By current state:**
- Worst off (those suffering most, most deprived)
- Average (typical conditions)
- Best off (those already thriving)

**By vulnerability:**
- Those who can't help themselves (children, disabled, oppressed)
- Those who can help themselves but face barriers
- Those who are fine

**Key question:** When interests conflict, whose counts more?

Possible principles:
- **Prioritarianism:** Weight toward worst off (helping someone at the bottom matters more than helping someone at the top)
- **Utilitarianism:** Total welfare (maximize aggregate wellbeing regardless of distribution)
- **Egalitarianism:** Equal distribution (reduce gaps)
- **Libertarianism:** Respect choices (let people pursue their own good)
- **Capability approach:** Enable human flourishing (ensure everyone can develop potential)

These conflict. Being explicit: I'll weight toward **prioritarianism with capability focus** - improving conditions for the worst off, with emphasis on enabling them to improve their own conditions.

### 1.3 Identify Timeframe

**Immediate (now - 1 year)**
- Relieve acute suffering
- Prevent imminent harms
- Quick wins

**Short-term (1-5 years)**
- Build capabilities
- Establish foundations
- Start longer projects

**Medium-term (5-20 years)**
- Structural changes
- System improvements
- Major projects complete

**Long-term (20-100 years)**
- Generational change
- Institutional transformation
- Deep culture shifts

**Very long-term (100+ years)**
- Civilizational trajectory
- Existential considerations
- Future generations

**Key tension:** Short-term relief vs long-term improvement often conflict. Feeding someone today doesn't fix why they're hungry. But they need to eat today.

Possible resolution: **Invest primarily in structural changes that have long-term effects, while not ignoring acute suffering that can be relieved now.** Roughly: 70% toward structural, 30% toward immediate relief.

### 1.4 Identify Constraints

**Physical constraints:**
- Laws of nature can't be violated
- Resources are finite
- Time is finite
- Geography limits some options
- Biology constrains what humans can do/want

**Ethical constraints:**
- No harming innocents to help others
- No deception of allies
- No violation of autonomy (can't force "better" on people)
- Means must be consistent with ends
- No rationalization of wrongs

**Practical constraints:**
- Limited resources (money, time, energy)
- Limited knowledge (don't know what works)
- Limited influence (can't control others)
- Limited access (not positioned everywhere)
- Coordination problems (can't make everyone cooperate)

**Social constraints:**
- Political feasibility (what institutions allow)
- Cultural acceptability (what people will support)
- Opposition (those who benefit from current state)
- Inertia (systems resist change)

**Personal constraints (for whoever is pursuing this):**
- Your specific capabilities
- Your specific resources
- Your specific position
- Your specific knowledge
- Your specific time and energy

### 1.5 Expanded Definition

"Make the world a better place" means:

**Improve conditions across multiple dimensions of wellbeing (material, psychological, social, freedom, justice, knowledge, beauty, virtue, sustainability, capability) for as many beings as possible, with priority given to those worst off, in ways that:**

- Enable long-term flourishing, not just temporary relief
- Respect the autonomy of those being helped
- Are sustainable and don't undermine future generations
- Don't cause harm to achieve good
- Work within actual constraints (physical, ethical, practical, social)
- Build capacity for ongoing improvement, not just one-time fixes

**Not included:**
- "Better" according to my preferences imposed on others
- Short-term fixes that create long-term problems
- Help that creates dependency
- Improvements for some at expense of others (unless justified by severe inequality)

40. Build adaptation capacity

### 2.2 Subgoal Dependencies

Some subgoals enable others:

**Foundational (enable most others):**
- Basic needs (2.1) → Can't pursue anything else while starving
- Physical security (2.3) → Can't build while under attack
- Health (2.2) → Can't function while sick
- Education (2.23) → Enables understanding of everything else

**Enabling (unlock categories):**
- Freedom (2.14-17) → Enables pursuit of own good
- Justice (2.18-21) → Enables trust and cooperation
- Knowledge (2.22-25) → Enables good decisions
- Trust (2.12) → Enables cooperation

**Amplifying (multiply other efforts):**
- Cooperation at scale (2.13) → Multiplies what can be achieved
- Innovation (2.39) → Finds better ways
- Adaptive capacity (2.40) → Survives change

**Dependent (require others first):**
- Meaning (2.7) → Hard to find meaning while suffering acutely
- Art (2.27) → Requires surplus beyond survival
- Virtue cultivation (2.30-33) → Requires some stability

**Dependency graph (simplified):**
```
Basic needs → Health → Agency → Meaning
     ↓          ↓        ↓
Security → Freedom → Capability → Innovation
     ↓          ↓        ↓
Education → Knowledge → Wisdom
     ↓          ↓
Justice → Trust → Cooperation → Scale
                      ↓
              Sustainability
```

### 2.3 Subgoal Conflicts

Some subgoals trade off against each other:

**Freedom vs Welfare:**
- Respecting autonomy may mean allowing choices that reduce wellbeing
- Helping people may require limiting their options (e.g., safety regulations)
- Resolution: Err toward freedom for competent adults making informed choices; intervene for vulnerable or uninformed

**Individual vs Collective:**
- Individual good may conflict with group good
- Coordination requires some individual sacrifice
- Resolution: Balance based on magnitude; small individual cost for large collective benefit is justified

**Present vs Future:**
- Current consumption vs future resources
- Immediate relief vs structural change
- Resolution: Weight toward future (they can't advocate for themselves) but don't ignore present suffering

**Local vs Global:**
- Helping your community vs helping strangers
- National interest vs global welfare
- Resolution: Special obligations to proximate exist, but global suffering at scale can override

**Equality vs Efficiency:**
- Equal distribution vs maximum total
- Fairness vs growth
- Resolution: Prioritize equality at the bottom (no one should lack basics) but allow inequality that benefits all

**Security vs Freedom:**
- Safety measures restrict liberty
- Freedom enables harm
- Resolution: Minimal security necessary; don't sacrifice core freedoms for marginal safety

**Truth vs Comfort:**
- Honest information may cause distress
- Comforting lies feel better short-term
- Resolution: Truth generally wins; people deserve to know reality

### 2.4 Subgoal Relationships Summary

**Must-haves (foundations without which nothing works):**
- Basic needs met
- Physical security
- Basic health
- Basic education

**High-leverage (enable many others):**
- Justice systems
- Trust infrastructure
- Knowledge/truth access
- Cooperation mechanisms

**Valuable but downstream:**
- Art and beauty
- Virtue cultivation
- Meaning and purpose
- Rich experience

**Protective (prevent catastrophe):**
- Existential risk reduction
- Ecological stability
- Adaptive capacity

## Phase 3: Prioritize Subgoals

### 3.1 Apply Prioritization Criteria

| Subgoal | Ease | Ethics | Accessibility | Amplification | Overlooked | Probability | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Basic needs | Hard | High | Medium | High | Low | Medium | Very High |
| Health improvement | Hard | High | Medium | High | Low | Medium | Very High |
| Security | Very Hard | High | Low | High | Low | Low | Very High |
| Education access | Medium | High | Medium | Very High | Medium | Medium | Very High |
| Reduce suffering | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | High |
| Increase freedom | Hard | High | Low | High | Medium | Low | High |
| Justice systems | Very Hard | High | Low | Very High | Low | Low | Very High |
| Trust building | Medium | High | Medium | Very High | High | Medium | High |
| Cooperation at scale | Hard | High | Low | Very High | Medium | Low | Very High |
| Truth/misinformation | Medium | High | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | High |
| Protect nature | Hard | High | Medium | High | Medium | Low | Very High |
| Existential risk | Hard | High | Low | Extreme | High | Unknown | Extreme |
| Innovation capacity | Medium | High | Medium | Very High | Medium | Medium | High |

### 3.2 Weight By Dependencies

**Tier 1: Foundational (must be addressed or nothing else works)**
1. Basic needs for those lacking
2. Physical security (reduce violence/war)
3. Basic health (prevent early death, major disease)
4. Basic education (literacy, numeracy, critical thinking)

**Tier 2: Enabling (unlocks large categories of improvement)**
5. Justice systems (accountability, rights, fairness)
6. Trust infrastructure (reliable institutions, honest information)
7. Freedom protections (autonomy, non-coercion)
8. Cooperation mechanisms (coordination at scale)

**Tier 3: Amplifying (multiplies effectiveness of everything else)**
9. Innovation capacity
10. Adaptive capacity
11. Knowledge/wisdom development
12. Existential risk reduction

**Tier 4: Fulfillment (valuable but requires lower tiers)**
13. Meaning and purpose
14. Art and beauty
15. Virtue cultivation
16. Rich experience

### 3.3 Account For Conflicts

**Resolved conflicts:**

- **Present vs Future:** Invest 70% in structural/long-term, 30% in immediate relief
- **Local vs Global:** Special weight to proximate, but global extreme suffering overrides
- **Freedom vs Welfare:** Freedom for informed adults, protection for vulnerable
- **Equality vs Efficiency:** Floor of basic needs for all, allow inequality above that

**Unresolved conflicts (require judgment in specific cases):**

- How much security justifies how much freedom restriction?
- When does helping become paternalistic?
- How to weight human welfare vs nature/animals?
- How much present sacrifice for how much future benefit?

### 3.4 Consider Comparative Advantage

**For an individual (like a GOSM user):**

Most people can't directly:
- End wars
- Reform justice systems
- Restructure economies
- Solve global coordination problems

Most people CAN:
- Contribute resources (donate effectively)
- Build things (create tools, businesses, organizations)
- Influence locally (community, networks)
- Generate knowledge (research, write, teach)
- Model behavior (demonstrate virtue, build trust)

**High comparative advantage opportunities:**

1. **Effective giving** - Direct resources to highest-impact interventions (easy to do, high impact per effort)

2. **Build something useful** - If you have skills, create tools/services that help (leverages capability)

3. **Spread truth** - Combat misinformation in your domain of expertise (uses knowledge)

4. **Local trust building** - Be reliable, honest, cooperative in your sphere (everyone can do)

5. **Existential risk work** - If technically capable, high leverage despite uncertainty

---

## Phase 4: Specify Action-Level Goals

### 4.1 For Each Prioritized Subgoal

**1. Basic needs for those lacking**

Actions available:
- Donate to effective charities (GiveDirectly, Against Malaria Foundation)
- Support policy change (advocate for aid, trade reform)
- Build businesses that serve the poor
- Volunteer (limited impact usually)

Concrete goal: Donate X% of income to GiveWell-recommended charities

Success criteria: Donations made, tracked, reviewed annually

**2. Health improvement globally**

Actions available:
- Donate to health charities (malaria nets, deworming, vaccines)
- Support health research
- Advocate for health policy

Concrete goal: Include health-focused giving in donation portfolio

Success criteria: Evidence of lives saved/improved per dollar

**3. Education access**

Actions available:
- Support education organizations
- Create educational content (if capable)
- Mentor individuals

Concrete goal: Create or support educational resources in area of expertise

Success criteria: Resources used, learning documented

**4. Truth/misinformation**

Actions available:
- Be accurate in own communication
- Support good journalism/research
- Create truthful content
- Challenge misinformation (carefully)

Concrete goal: Maintain high epistemic standards; create truthful content if creating content

Success criteria: No knowingly false claims; corrections when wrong

**5. Trust building locally**

Actions available:
- Be reliable (do what you say)
- Be honest (don't deceive)
- Cooperate in prisoner's dilemmas

**7. Existential risk**

Actions available:
- Support organizations working on it (80,000 Hours, MIRI, etc.)
- Work directly if qualified
- Raise awareness thoughtfully

Concrete goal: Include existential risk in consideration set; support if aligned with capabilities

Success criteria: Informed engagement; resources directed if appropriate

### 4.2 Apply Constraints

**Filtering by personal constraints (hypothetical):**

- Limited money → Effective giving matters more than amount
- Technical skills → Building useful things is high leverage
- Limited political access → Policy change is hard to affect
- Knowledge in some domains → Truth-telling there is valuable
- Limited time → Focus on highest-leverage actions

**Filtered priority actions:**

1. Effective giving (whatever amount, to highest-impact causes)
2. Build something useful (if capable)
3. Maintain integrity/trust (always possible)
4. Create/share truth in domain of competence
5. Support existential risk work (if aligned with capabilities)

### 4.3 Sequence Actions

**Immediate (can start now):**
- Set up effective giving (research charities, set up donations)
- Commit to integrity standards (decide principles, document)
- Inventory own capabilities (what can I build/create?)

**Short-term (next 1-12 months):**
- Establish giving pattern
- Identify building opportunity
- Begin building/creating
- Document and share learnings

**Medium-term (1-5 years):**
- Scale what's working
- Adjust based on feedback
- Expand scope if successful
- Deepen expertise in chosen area

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Compound effects of sustained effort
- Mentor others
- Institutional contribution
- Legacy considerations

### 4.4 Define Success Criteria

**For "make the world a better place" overall:**

Minimum viable success:
- Resources directed to high-impact causes
- No harm caused in pursuing good
- Integrity maintained
- Some positive contribution documented

Good success:
- Measurable positive impact (lives improved, suffering reduced)
- Something built that helps at scale
- Trust earned and maintained
- Knowledge created and shared

Excellent success:
- Significant contribution to major problem
- Sustainable/ongoing positive effects
- Others enabled to contribute
- Clear evidence of counterfactual impact

## Summary: The Decomposed Goal

**"Make the world a better place" decomposes to:**

### Dimensions to improve:
Material, psychological, social, freedom, justice, knowledge, beauty, virtue, sustainability, capability

### Priority populations:
Worst off first; future generations weighted; all sentient beings considered

### Timeframe:
70% structural/long-term, 30% immediate relief

### Core constraints:
No harm to achieve good; respect autonomy; sustainability; within actual capability

### Priority subgoals (for an individual):
1. Direct resources effectively (giving)
2. Build something useful (leverage skills)
3. Maintain integrity (trust foundation)
4. Share truth (in competence area)
5. Support existential risk work (high leverage)

### Immediate actions:
1. Research and set up effective giving
2. Inventory capabilities and identify building opportunity
3. Document and commit to integrity principles

### Success looks like:
Resources directed well + something built + integrity maintained + truth shared + evidence of positive impact

---

## What This Decomposition Reveals

### The goal is massive
"Make the world a better place" contains dozens of subgoals across ten dimensions, for billions of people, over indefinite time. No individual can address it all.

### Focus is necessary
The decomposition forces choice. You can't do everything. What specifically will YOU do given YOUR situation?

### Tradeoffs are real
Present vs future. Local vs global. Freedom vs welfare. The decomposition makes these explicit rather than hiding them.

### Foundations matter
Basic needs → freedom → justice → cooperation → everything else. Getting the sequence wrong wastes effort.

### Individual contribution is bounded
Most structural change requires coordination beyond individual action. Individual contribution is either:
- Resource direction (giving)
- Capability deployment (building)
- Trust contribution (integrity)
- Knowledge contribution (truth)

### The test remains empirical
This decomposition is reasoned but not proven. Whether these priorities and actions actually make the world better is an empirical question requiring tracking and validation.
