# Question Analysis Framework for Pure Regress Files
# Purpose: Transform raw questions into prioritized, actionable analysis with minimal guessing

version: "1.0"
description: |
  This framework provides methods for analyzing philosophical questions to determine:
  1. Which questions are foundational (answering them unlocks other answers)
  2. Which questions already have rigorous answers in existing research
  3. Which questions can be answered deductively vs empirically
  4. How questions depend on each other (DAG structure)
  5. What analysis methods produce answers with high confidence

# ====================
# REACTION ANALYSIS
# ====================
# What is this framework reacting to?

reaction_chain:
  surface_observation: "400,000+ questions across 100+ files exist"
  surface_reaction: "How do I know which questions matter?"
  deeper_reaction: "Generating questions is easy; knowing which MATTER is hard"
  core_reaction: "I want methods that produce certainty, not more questions"
  meta_reaction: "If I had a method to prioritize questions, how do I know THAT method is correct?"
  resolution: "Find foundational questions whose answers are self-evident or deductively derivable"
