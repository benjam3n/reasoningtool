Each seed question gets intent-regress prompts (no answers).

## Q0011

**Seed**: Is there a minimal viable artifact that demonstrates a question's productive branch after a transform?

**Intent Ladder (single-branch skeleton)**:
- What did I mean by asking: "Is there a minimal viable artifact that demonstrates a question's productive branch after a transform?"?
- What did I mean by that clarification question?
- Why did this seed question appear here (what caused it / why was it included)?
- What artifact/event would answer that (provenance/evidence/interface)?

**Goal Candidates**:
- Why was this question included?
- What caused the need for this question to appear?

**Answer-Interface**:
- What observation or artifact would discriminate among interpretations?
- Where in the repo should we look first?

**Action Hooks**:
- grep -RIn "..." "projects/2026-01-22_gosm-swot-analysis"
