Is there a plan to periodically rotate focal categories to refresh perspective while preserving continuity?
What would count as a concrete indicator that a transformed question has achieved auditability?
How can we make the relation between questions and critical artifacts explicit in the repository metadata?
If new data sources become available, how should they reshape the current question trajectory without breaking coherence?
What is the minimal viable artifact that proves a question has meaningfully reframed the issue?
How can we ensure the symmetry check reveals deep asymmetries rather than cosmetic reversals?

Are there explicit metrics to compare question yields across different modes (RCI, pure_regress, framework interrogation)?
What is the role of the question stream in mediating between consensus and dissent within the team?
Could a time-index reveal that some questions decay in relevance, and how should that influence subsequent steps?
