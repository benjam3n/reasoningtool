Is there an explicit definition of evidence in this project context?
What is evidence when tied to a governance gate in the SWOT analysis?
Is evidence here descriptive, prescriptive, or evaluative?
What would count as evidence that the SWOT plan reduces risk?
Is there a risk that "evidence" becomes a rhetorical placeholder rather than a test?
How would we differentiate evidence from mere assurance statements?
Are there defined evidence types mapped to concrete artifacts (logs, tests, templates)?
What is value in the sense of a GOSM gate, and where is it anchored?
Is value being used as a boundary or as an evaluative standard?
What would count as a boundary break for "value" in scope?
Is there a risk of conflating value with utility or aesthetics?
How do we measure value without collapsing into stakeholder rhetoric?
Is progress defined as momentum, accuracy, or something else?
What would count as "correct" progress in the SWOT workflow?
Is progress aligned with the STATE.md semantics, or is there a gap?
How does forward derivation test progress premises without concluding?
Is there a forward-derivation trap where we generate implications but never test them?
What is the role of "order" in the category coverage check?
Is order about sequencing of questions or the stability of the framework?
Do we have a clear mapping from steps to artifacts (gates, logs)?
How is "first" treated as a planning artifact here?
Is the concept of "first" anchored to a decision point, a trigger, or a time index?
What counts as the boundary of "first" in iterative questioning?
Does the framework risk privileging early questions over deeper ones?
How do transforms (Reversal, Negation, etc.) produce new lines of inquiry in practice?
Are there concrete examples of a transform leading to a fresh question in this corpus?
Is boundary (scope) used to carve out orthogonal areas or to fragment the problem?
What is the scope boundary for the current question stream?
How many times can time-indexing produce meaningful new questions before stalling?
Is there a timescale where certain questions drift or decay?
What would grade-level vs system-level scale mean in the SWOT context?
Is there an agency split among actors who can change gate outcomes?
Who is allowed to modify governance gates in this project?
Are incentives attached to the belief in certain claims, and how?
What incentives would encourage productive questioning rather than defensive posturing?
What counts as evidence that a transform was applied correctly?
Is the deduplication step harming thoroughness or efficiency?
When would de-duplication be necessary to escape loops?
Do we have a loop registry to track fixed points we keep hitting?
How would a fixed point be identified in practice?
Is there a risk that the question ledger becomes unwieldy?
What would be a minimal viable artifact for the question ledger in this project?
Is it possible that the question stream prioritizes novelty over reliability?
How do we anchor questions to concrete project artifacts (gates, logs, templates)?
Is there a harm in moving too far from the corpus while still avoiding rehash?
What would constitute GOSM-specific anchoring for a given category?
Are there new transforms not yet used in this project that could unlock a category?
What compression is present in the word "quality" for this project?
How does "progress" relate to the STATE semantics in practice?
Is "measurement" merely a curiosity or a necessary gate?
What would a measurement impulse look like in the SWOT workflow?
Are there known measurement traps that mislead decision-makers?
How do we map measurement results to observable artifacts?
Is "procedure" distinguishable as idea vs executable spec in this context?
Does procedure as executable spec connect to logs and runbooks?
Are there named procedures that survive a loop test or injection?
Is "governance" too abstract, or does it have concrete gate definitions in this project?
How would we audit the governance layer for reliability?
Is "reliability" defined for a specific operation in GOSM?
What would count as a counterfactual where reliability fails?
Is "quality" conflated with "reliability" or are they distinct?
How do we tease apart quality across inputs, processes, and outputs?
Is "outcome" defined at a meta-system level or at artifact-level?
What would count as an undesirable outcome in the SWOT context?
Is stopping treated as a gate or a dynamic state in the model?
How do we differentiate intentional stopping from inadvertent stopping?
Is "auditability" present enough in artifacts to verify actions?
Are logs sufficient to demonstrate auditability, or do we need independent verification?
Could "benchmark" be defined for GOSM, and what would it measure?
How would a baseline be established for SWOT metrics?
Is there a risk that the category coverage table itself becomes a constraint?
How would we test the hypothesis that most broad categories are already covered?
What evidence would support the claim that we need a new transform per category?
How do boundary questions handle external dependencies outside the project scope?
Is there a single overarching objective that frames the question stream, or are there multiple goals?
Can a question be both about process and artifact simultaneously?
How do we prevent question fatigue in long streams?
Is there a separate channel for recording "unknowns" that resist immediate categorization?
Are there fixed points where the framework explicitly says "stop" or "pause"?
What would be the mechanism to reconstruct the reasoning after a loop is encountered?
