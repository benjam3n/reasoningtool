Is there a risk that the question ledger becomes tautological if we chase fixed points too aggressively?
Does the current transform set exhaustively cover boundary, time-index, and agency perspectives, or are there domain-specific angles missing?
If skepticism is converted into conditional claims, what is a specific conditional we can test right after this line?
Are we inadvertently privileging forward implications as proxies for truth rather than as test prompts?
What would count as a minimal viable artifact that proves a question has been meaningfully reframed?
How do we ensure the symmetry check reveals deep asymmetries rather than cosmetic reversals?
Is there a concrete mapping from each question to a corresponding artifact (gate, log, template) in the repo?
When a loop reappears, what criteria determine which transform to apply next to escape it?
Can we design a boundary transform that isolates a question from broader dependencies without losing relevance?
What if time-indexing reveals questions that drift beyond the current project horizon; how should we handle that drift?
Are there hidden dependencies between categories (evidence, value, progress) that cause cross-talk in the questions?
Which transforms have produced the richest yield in past pure_regress cycles, and why might they fail here?
Is the notion of "first" in this context always a planning artifact, or can it be a cognitive placeholder?
What would a GOSM-specific anchoring look like for a category that currently seems abstract?
Do we risk over-anchoring questions to specific templates at the expense of novel angles?
If we define progress as a gate metric, what are the exact artifacts that would demonstrate progress?
How do we reconcile the desire for thorough questioning with the risk of question fatigue over long streams?
Is there a separate channel for recording unknowns that resist immediate categorization, and should it be linked to the QUESTION_LEDGER?
What would constitute a minimal viable loop registry that still scales as the stream expands?
Should we treat "auditability" as an artifact property (logs, verifications) or as an operational gate in practice?

If we application-test a forward implication, what would constitute a failure mode that confirms the premise is invalid?
How might a new transform illuminate a previously neglected dimension of governance or reliability?
Are there critical blind spots introduced by relying on previous corpus patterns, and how would we detect them?
What would a GOSM-specific compression marker look like for a given category, and how would it be annotated?

How do we ensure that each generated question remains grounded in tangible artifacts rather than abstract rhetoric?
If a category like measurement is "heavy," what concrete questions would demonstrate measurable linkage to artifacts?
Could a boundary question reveal that some questions are actually orthogonal to the project goals?
What would be the mechanism to trace a transformed question back to its original motivation for auditability?
Are there known failure modes in the question-analysis framework that we should actively test for?
How would we identify when a question is drifting toward a storytelling trope rather than a testable claim?
Should we implement a lightweight scoring to flag questions that appear too narrative and not testable?
What is the role of the question stream in mediating between consensus and dissent within the team?
If a question triggers multiple branches, how do we decide which branch to foreground for further interrogation?
Is there a risk that the phrase “better treatment” becomes a normative trap rather than an evaluative criterion?
How would we validate that a new transform provides genuinely novel inquiry rather than re-labeled old questions?
Can a question serve as a boundary marker for a future project phase, and how would we capture that?
What would be a principled way to compare the current question stream to the prior pure_regress corpora without bias?
If the question ledger is overwhelmed, what lightweight pruning rules preserve integrity without erasing value?
Are there incentive structures that could distort how we prioritize certain questions over others, and how can we detect them?
How can we make the relation between questions and critical artifacts explicit in the repository metadata?

Is there a way to quantify the novelty of a question within the context of GOSM?
When applying the boundary transform, how do we determine what lies inside vs outside scope across multiple layers?
Could a time-index reveal that some questions decay in relevance, and how should that influence subsequent steps?
What would be the concrete indicators that a question stream has achieved a different epistemic stance from the corpus base?
How do we guard against conflating process questions with substantive domain questions in the same line?
If a question references a specific artifact like STATE.md, what is the protocol to verify the artifact’s current state before interrogating it?
Is there a risk that the question stream becomes a ritual rather than a living interrogation engine?
How would we design a go/no-go gate for questions that consistently fail to gain traction?
Should there be a formal notion of question ownership to prevent duplication of effort across transforms?
What is the minimal set of questions needed to establish a credible boundary for a given category?
Can we derive a meta-question that tests the very reliability of the questioning process itself?
How can we ensure alignment between the QUESTION_LEDGER and the ASSUMPTION_REGISTER over time?
What would be an explicit example of a compression for the word “quality” that is unique to this project?
If we swap the order of two questions, under what conditions would the overall inquiry trajectory improve?
Is there a principled way to measure the latency between generating a question and its resolution or redirection?
What kinds of artifacts would best support a reversible path for a question if the original direction proves flawed?
How do we differentiate descriptive versus normative uses of terms like governance within the SWOT context?
What would a forward-derivation test look like for “auditability” in a future-state scenario?
Could there be a risk of conflating “stopping” with “gate” as two distinct dynamic mechanisms, and how would we test that?
If new data sources become available, how should they reshape the current question trajectory without breaking coherence?
What is the minimal viable mapping from each question to a concrete decision point in the project timeline?
How can we ensure the question transforms remain composable as the stream grows in length and complexity?

If a question references multiple categories, how do we disambiguate the primary target of interrogation?
Can we create a diagnostic question that specifically reveals hidden assumptions embedded in the framework itself?
What would count as an explicit counterexample that falsifies a leading assumption in the framework?
