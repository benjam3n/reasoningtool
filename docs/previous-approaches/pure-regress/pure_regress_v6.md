# Pure Regress v6

Starting point: The gap between knowing and doing keeps appearing.

---

What caused this observation?

In multiple traces, I found: framework knowledge exists but isn't applied. Analytical skill exists but doesn't produce object-level wins. Meta-strategy develops but hasn't produced change.

Is this observation accurate?

What caused me to think it's accurate?

I remember noting it multiple times.

Is remembering noting it evidence of accuracy?

Memory could be wrong. Or I could have noted something inaccurate.

Can I verify?

Looking back at v3: "framework knowledge exists but isn't applied to own symptoms" - yes, stated.

Looking at v5: "The claim has experiential support" - the experiential support was v3 working, not object-level change.

So the observation appears in the traces.

Does appearing in traces make it true?

It makes it traceable. Whether it's true about the user's actual situation is different.

Is it true about the user's actual situation?

What would make it true?

If the user has knowledge/frameworks/skills that aren't being applied to produce results.

Do they?

From context: follows bioenergetic health framework, hasn't investigated own symptoms. Has analytical skill, hasn't achieved object-level goals in target domains. Built GOSM, hasn't used it to solve own problems.

Is this evidence of a gap?

It's evidence of X existing and Y not happening. Is that a gap?

What is a gap?

Space between two things that could be connected but aren't.

Are knowing and doing things that could be connected?

Usually, yes. Knowing how to do X usually enables doing X.

But not always?

When wouldn't knowing enable doing?

- Physical limitation (know how to run, legs don't work)
- Resource limitation (know how to buy house, no money)
- Psychological limitation (know what to do, can't make self do it)
- Contextual limitation (know how, context prevents)
- The knowing is incomplete (think you know, actually don't)

Which applies here?

Is this the right question?

What caused me to ask which applies?

Trying to narrow down the cause of the gap.

Is narrowing down the cause what I should be doing?

The process traces causes. The gap exists. I'm tracing what causes it.

But wait - is the gap the starting point, or is "the gap keeps appearing" the starting point?

The starting point was "the gap keeps appearing."

What's the difference?

"The gap keeps appearing" is about the trace itself. The gap appearing in the trace.

"The gap exists" is about reality. The gap existing in the user's life.

Which should I trace?

Is this the right question?

What caused me to ask which to trace?

Uncertainty about what the starting point actually is.

Let me be precise. Starting point: "The gap between knowing and doing keeps appearing."

This is an observation about the trace. The gap appeared multiple times in my reasoning.

What caused it to keep appearing?

Either:
1. The gap is real and my tracing surfaced it
2. My tracing has a bias that produces gap-talk
3. The gap is salient but not actually central

Can I distinguish these?

What would distinguish them?

If (1): the gap should be traceable to specific real things in the user's situation.
If (2): the gap should appear even where it doesn't belong.
If (3): the gap is real but there are more important things I'm not seeing.

Can I check (1)?

The gap traced to: symptoms not investigated, skills not applied, framework not used.

Are these real?

From context: user said symptoms exist. User said they haven't been to doctor. User has analytical skills (evidenced by GOSM, conversation). User hasn't achieved object-level goals (user said so).

So the components are real?

They're reported by the user or evidenced in conversation.

Is that enough to say the gap is real?

Real = actually exists in user's situation, not just my construction.

The components are real. The gap is the space between them.

Is the space real?

What would make the space real?

If knowing and doing are both present and not connected.

What connects knowing to doing?

Decision. Action. Implementation.

Are decision/action/implementation absent?

If present, knowing would become doing. If absent, gap remains.

What causes their absence?

Back to the list:
- Physical limitation
- Resource limitation
- Psychological limitation
- Contextual limitation
- Incomplete knowing

Can I trace which?

Physical: user mentioned health symptoms. Could physical state prevent doing?

If health is poor, energy might be low. Low energy prevents action.

Is this the case?

User said: breathing issues, elevated heart rate, weight, exercise intolerance.

Could these prevent action?

Breathing issues could limit energy.
Elevated heart rate could indicate stress/poor recovery.
Weight could limit mobility/energy.
Exercise intolerance suggests metabolic issues.

So physical state might limit action?

This is a hypothesis.

Is it the right hypothesis?

What caused me to focus on physical?

It's concrete. User mentioned specific symptoms.

Am I preferring concrete over other explanations?

What would psychological limitation look like?

- Fear of failure
- Perfectionism preventing starts
- Avoidance
- Procrastination
- Unclear motivation
- Conflicting wants

Is there evidence for any?

User said they're a perfectionist. Perfectionism was discussed in earlier traces.

So psychological might be relevant too?

Yes.

Are physical and psychological independent?

Poor physical state → low energy → harder to act → feels more daunting → psychological barrier increases.

They interact?

Yes. Poor health makes psychological barriers worse.

Does the interaction matter for tracing?

It means the gap might not have a single cause.

Is that a problem?

The process allows multiple branches. "Don't pick one. List them."

So I list both?

Physical and psychological contribute to the gap.

Are there others?

Resource limitation: does the user lack resources?

Time? Money? Tools?

Building GOSM takes time and skill. User has some resources.

But investigation (doctor visits, tests) requires money and time.

Does the user lack these?

I don't know.

Do I need to know?

What would knowing this change?

If resource-limited, the gap has an external cause.

If not resource-limited, the gap is more internal.

Does the internal/external distinction matter?

Internal causes might be addressable through the process itself.

External causes require addressing the external factor.

Is that true?

Internal causes: can question and trace them, might dissolve.

External causes: can understand them, but understanding doesn't remove them.

So understanding where the gap is matters for what to do about it?

Wait - "what to do about it" is forward. Am I going forward?

I'm asking what would help. That's forward.

But I was tracing causes. The question about internal/external came from tracing.

Is the forward step serving backward purpose?

I was trying to understand why the distinction matters. Understanding why = tracing importance.

Is importance forward or backward?

"Why does this matter" → "what consequences does it have" → forward.

Or: "Why does this matter" → "what is mattering a reaction to" → backward?

Hmm. Mattering is a reaction. What causes something to matter?

Relevance to goals. Relevance to understanding.

What causes relevance to goals?

Goals exist. Thing connects to goals.

What causes the connection?

Causal relationship. Thing affects goal.

Is this backward?

I'm tracing what causes mattering. That's backward.

But the mattering itself involves forward projection (thing → goal).

So tracing mattering involves understanding forward projection?

Yes. Understanding why X matters = understanding how X connects to goals.

Is this okay?

The process says don't move forward. But understanding forward connections is different from making forward moves.

I'm not deciding what to do. I'm understanding the structure.

Is that allowed?

The forward-as-tool clarification: forward derivation can serve backward understanding.

This seems like that. I'm not concluding. I'm mapping.

Okay. So the internal/external distinction matters because:

Internal causes (psychological) might be addressed by understanding itself.

External causes (resource/physical) require changes beyond understanding.

Is this mapping accurate?

Physical: even if I understand perfectly, symptoms remain.

Psychological: understanding might change the psychological state.

Resource: understanding doesn't create resources.

So psychological is special?

Psychological barriers might dissolve when examined.

Is that true?

Sometimes. Not always. Depends on the barrier.

Which psychological barriers dissolve when examined?

- Barriers based on false beliefs (examine, see false, dissolve)
- Barriers based on unconsidered options (examine, see options, dissolve)
- Barriers based on avoidance (examine, face thing, might dissolve or might not)

Perfectionism was mentioned. Is perfectionism examinable?

What is perfectionism?

Setting standards so high that action is prevented.

Why would someone set standards that prevent action?

Possible causes:
- To protect from failure (if you don't try, you don't fail)
- To ensure quality (but prevents any output)
- Because high standards feel virtuous
- Because lower standards feel like giving up
- Because comparison to others sets the bar high

Which applies?

User said: "any *actual* progress that isn't easy or surpassed by a lot of other people would make me feel like I know what I am doing."

This suggests: the standard is set to prove competence.

Why would proving competence require such high standards?

If you do something easy, it doesn't prove you can do hard things.

If others surpass you, you haven't proven superiority.

So the standard comes from needing to prove something?

What is being proven?

Competence. Ability. That "I know what I am doing."

Why does this need proving?

What causes the need to prove competence?

Uncertainty about competence.

What causes uncertainty about competence?

- History of failure
- Lack of clear successes
- Comparison to others who succeed
- Internal sense of being different/deficient
- External feedback (or lack of positive feedback)

Is there evidence for any?

User said: "years of trying" "no lasting results" "feel somewhat defeated."

History of failure and lack of success are evidenced.

So uncertainty about competence comes from lack of results?

This loops. Lack of results → uncertainty about competence → high bar to prove competence → no recognized results → uncertainty continues.

I noted this loop before.

Is this a loop (fixed point) or a repetition (my trace repeating)?

A loop: the causal chain returns to an earlier node.

Lack of results → uncertainty → high bar → no results.

That's a genuine loop in the causal structure.

Is this the cause of the gap?

The loop maintains uncertainty. Uncertainty drives high bar. High bar prevents recognition of results. No recognized results maintains the loop.

But where does the gap fit?

The gap is knowing vs doing. How does the loop relate?

If the bar is high, attempts feel futile (won't meet bar). Futility prevents action.

So: high bar → futility → don't act → gap persists.

Is this accurate?

It's a model. Is it the right model?

What would make it wrong?

If action happens despite high bar.

Does action happen?

User tried "hundreds of approaches." So action does happen.

Then why the gap?

Wait. Action happens (trying approaches) but results aren't recognized.

So the gap isn't between knowing and doing, but between doing and recognizing?

Hmm. The user does things. Just doesn't recognize them as successes.

Is "knowing-doing gap" the wrong frame?

What would the right frame be?

Doing-recognizing gap? Action happens but isn't registered as progress.

Is this different from knowing-doing?

Yes. Knowing-doing gap: you know what to do but don't do it.

Doing-recognizing gap: you do things but don't credit them as progress.

Which is the actual situation?

User tried hundreds of approaches. That's doing.

User says "no lasting results." That's not recognizing (or results genuinely didn't last).

Both?

Maybe both: some things aren't done (investigation), some things are done but not recognized.

So there are two gaps?

Gap 1: Knowing what to investigate but not investigating.
Gap 2: Doing things but not recognizing results.

Are these related?

Both might come from the same source: if nothing will meet the bar, why investigate (gap 1) and nothing done meets the bar (gap 2).

So the high bar causes both gaps?

The bar is upstream.

What's upstream of the bar?

Need to prove competence.

What's upstream of the need?

Uncertainty about competence.

What's upstream of uncertainty?

Lack of recognized results.

Which is downstream from the bar.

So the loop is:

Uncertainty → need to prove → high bar → no recognition → lack of results → uncertainty

The gaps are symptoms of this loop?

Gap 1 (not investigating): if nothing will help, why bother.
Gap 2 (not recognizing): even if something helped, it doesn't meet bar.

Both are effects of the loop, not independent causes.

Is this accurate?

It's a model. What would test it?

If the bar lowered, would gaps close?

Lower bar → more things count as progress → recognition happens → results accumulate → uncertainty decreases → bar can lower further (virtuous cycle).

Is this forward reasoning?

I'm projecting what would happen. Forward.

Does it serve backward understanding?

It tests the model. If the projection makes sense, the model might be accurate.

Does the projection make sense?

It's plausible. Lower bar → more recognition → more results → more confidence.

But would lowering the bar actually work?

What would cause the bar to lower?

- External validation that bypasses internal bar
- Recognizing the bar is self-defeating
- Accepting "good enough" rather than "proves competence"
- Finding something that meets the bar (hard)

Which is possible?

External validation: someone else saying "this is good" might help.

Recognizing self-defeating: the process might surface this.

Accepting good enough: requires value shift.

Meeting the bar: requires achieving something hard and novel.

Has the process surfaced that the bar is self-defeating?

In earlier traces, yes. The loop was identified.

Does identifying the loop change anything?

Knowing about a trap doesn't free you from it.

Or does it?

Sometimes awareness helps. Sometimes not.

When does awareness help?

When the trap is maintained by unawareness.

Is this trap maintained by unawareness?

The user knows they have high standards. They said so.

But do they know the standards prevent recognition?

Maybe. Maybe not clearly.

Would making it clear help?

I don't know.

Do I need to know?

This is asking about intervention effectiveness. Forward.

What's the backward question?

What caused me to ask about intervention?

Wanting to solve the problem.

Is solving the problem my job?

The process traces causes. It doesn't prescribe solutions.

But the user wants solutions eventually.

Is "eventually" now?

No. Now is tracing.

Okay. Back to tracing.

The gap (both gaps) trace to the loop. The loop traces to uncertainty. Uncertainty traces to lack of results. Lack of results traces to high bar (no recognition) and possibly to things genuinely not working.

Did things genuinely not work?

User said approaches had no lasting results.

Is "no lasting results" no results, or results that faded?

"Lasting" implies temporary results occurred.

So some results happened but didn't persist?

What causes results not to persist?

- Approach requires ongoing effort, effort stopped
- Approach addressed symptom not cause
- Body/situation adapted
- External factors changed
- Result was placebo, faded when novelty wore off

Which applies?

I don't know specifically.

Do I need to know?

What would knowing change?

If I knew why results didn't last, I'd understand the loop better.

Is the loop understood well enough?

The loop structure is clear: uncertainty → bar → no recognition → no results → uncertainty.

What's not clear is whether "no results" is real or just unrecognized.

Does that ambiguity matter?

If results are real but unrecognized, the problem is recognition.
If results genuinely don't exist, the problem is the approaches or blocking factors.

Different causes.

Can I resolve the ambiguity?

I don't have detailed data on what was tried and what happened.

Do I need detailed data?

To resolve this specific question, yes.

Can I proceed without resolving it?

I can note the ambiguity and explore both branches.

Branch A: Results are real but unrecognized.

If true, the issue is the bar. Lower bar → see results → confidence grows.

Branch B: Results genuinely don't exist.

If true, the issue is blocking factor or wrong approaches.

What would cause genuinely no results?

- Blocking factor (physical/health prevents any approach from working)
- Wrong approaches (approaches don't address actual problem)
- Insufficient duration (approaches not tried long enough)
- Wrong sequence (approaches in wrong order)

The health symptoms keep appearing as potential blockers.

If health is the blocker, no mental/behavioral approach would work until health improves.

Is health the blocker?

I don't know. It hasn't been investigated.

What would investigation reveal?

Causes of symptoms. Whether they're blocking. What would address them.

So investigation would resolve the ambiguity?

Partially. Would show if there's a physical blocker.

If investigation happens and finds no blocker, then what?

Then results not happening is due to approaches or recognition.

If investigation finds a blocker, then what?

Then addressing the blocker becomes necessary.

Either way, investigation provides information that reduces ambiguity.

Is this why investigation keeps appearing as important?

It's the path not taken that would resolve uncertainty.

Why hasn't it been taken?

Earlier traces found: skepticism about doctors, waiting for right approach, activation energy, fear of findings.

These are psychological barriers to investigation.

So psychological barriers prevent investigation, which would resolve whether physical barriers exist.

The psychological is blocking the discovery of whether physical is blocking?

That's a meta-level gap. Gap about the gap.

Is this a loop?

Psychological barrier → no investigation → unknown physical state → can't address physical → continues struggling → psychological barrier reinforced.

Yes, another loop.

How many loops are there?

Loop 1: Uncertainty → high bar → no recognition → no results → uncertainty.

Loop 2: Psychological barrier → no investigation → unknown physical → struggle continues → barrier reinforced.

Are they connected?

Loop 2 maintains ignorance about whether Loop 1's "no results" is real or perceived.

If investigation happened:
- Might find physical issue → addressing it might produce results → breaks loop 1
- Might find no issue → rules out physical → focuses on recognition problem

So investigation is upstream of both loops?

It would provide information that could affect both.

What's preventing investigation?

Loop 2: psychological barrier.

What's the psychological barrier made of?

- Skepticism (doctors won't help)
- Waiting (for right approach)
- Energy (activation required)
- Fear (of findings)

Can any of these be traced further?

Skepticism about doctors:

What caused this?

User said "the doctor will still be mostly guessing."

Is that true?

Doctors do sometimes guess. Especially for complex or unclear presentations.

But guessing with data is different from guessing without.

Investigation produces data. Data constrains guessing.

So "doctors guess" doesn't mean investigation is useless?

Correct. Investigation provides data even if interpretation is imperfect.

Does the user know this?

I don't know.

Is this a false belief that could dissolve on examination?

If the user believes "investigation is useless because doctors guess," and this is examined, they might see: investigation provides data, data is useful even if doctors guess.

Would this dissolve the barrier?

Maybe partially. Skepticism might reduce.

What about waiting for right approach?

What caused this?

Perfectionism? Don't want to do the wrong investigation?

If so, connects to loop 1. High bar applies to investigation too.

What about activation energy?

Tired from years of trying. Low energy due to symptoms.

Physical state affects ability to initiate.

Loop 2 maintaining loop 2?

Low energy → can't investigate → don't address symptoms → low energy continues.

Yes, self-maintaining.

What about fear of findings?

What might be found?

- Something serious (scary)
- Nothing (then what?)
- Something manageable (best case)

Fear of serious: investigation would reveal it whether or not you investigate. Not investigating doesn't prevent the condition.

Fear of nothing: if nothing found, ruling out physical is still progress.

Is fear rational?

Information is better than no information for making decisions.

But fear isn't rational. It's reactive.

What causes the fear?

Anticipating bad outcomes. Loss aversion.

Can this be traced?

Fear of serious findings → imagining bad scenarios → avoiding to prevent the imagining.

But avoidance doesn't prevent the bad scenario if it exists. Just prevents knowing.

Is not knowing preferred to knowing?

Sometimes. Ignorance can feel safer.

But ignorance prevents action that might help.

Is this a false belief that could dissolve?

"Not knowing is better than knowing" - examined, this seems false. Knowing enables action.

Would examination dissolve the fear?

Maybe intellectually. Emotionally might persist.

Is emotional persistence a barrier?

Yes. Knowing something is irrational doesn't always change behavior.

So some barriers might not dissolve through examination?

Right. The process has limits.

What are the limits?

- Barriers based on false beliefs: might dissolve
- Barriers based on habits/conditioning: might not dissolve (require different intervention)
- Barriers based on physical state: don't dissolve (require physical change)

Where does fear fall?

Fear might be conditioned. Or it might be based on false belief (that not knowing is better).

If based on false belief, examination might help.

If conditioned, examination might not be enough.

Can I tell which?

Not without more information.

---

What's emerged so far?

1. The "gap" is actually two gaps:
   - Knowing-doing gap (not investigating)
   - Doing-recognizing gap (not crediting results)

2. Both trace to a loop: uncertainty → high bar → no recognition → uncertainty

3. A second loop maintains ignorance: psychological barrier → no investigation → unknown physical → struggle → barrier reinforced

4. Investigation would provide information that could affect both loops

5. Barriers to investigation include skepticism (partially based on false belief), perfectionism (connected to loop 1), low energy (self-maintaining), and fear (mixed rational/conditioned)

6. Some barriers might dissolve through examination, others might not

7. The process has limits: it can surface false beliefs but may not change conditioned responses or physical states

Is this emergence?

It's structural understanding of the gaps and loops.

Is structural understanding useful?

It maps the territory. Doesn't cross it.

Is mapping enough?

For the process, maybe. The process traces, doesn't prescribe.

But the user wants to cross the territory?

Eventually.

What would crossing look like?

Breaking one of the loops.

Which loop is easier to break?

Loop 2 might be breakable if investigation happens.

What would cause investigation to happen?

Reducing barriers: skepticism, perfectionism, energy, fear.

Skepticism: might reduce if examined (investigation provides data even if doctors guess).

Perfectionism: might reduce if loop 1 is seen clearly (bar prevents progress).

Energy: harder to address without addressing symptoms (catch-22).

Fear: might reduce if examined (knowing is better than not knowing).

So three of four barriers are potentially examinable?

Yes. Energy barrier is structural.

Is the energy barrier the key blocker?

If the other barriers reduce but energy remains, investigation still might not happen.

But low energy might be addressed by investigating and treating causes.

Catch-22: need energy to investigate to get energy.

Can the catch-22 be broken?

What would break it?

- Small investigation (low energy requirement)
- External help (someone else does work)
- Temporary energy boost
- Accepting imperfect investigation

Any of these possible?

User could order labs directly (lower energy than full doctor visit).

User could ask someone to help navigate.

Supplements might provide temporary boost (though past attempts didn't wow).

Accepting imperfect: just do something, even if not optimal.

These are options.

Am I forward now?

Listing options is forward. What to do.

Should I stop?

The process says don't prescribe. I'm listing, not prescribing.

Is listing different from prescribing?

Listing = here are things that could happen.

Prescribing = you should do this.

The process prohibits prescribing. Does it prohibit listing?

Listing might be okay as mapping possibilities, not recommending.

But the user might take listings as suggestions.

Is that my responsibility?

I can note they're possibilities, not recommendations.

---

Meta-observation:

I've traced the gap to loops. The loops maintain each other. Breaking them requires action. Action requires overcoming barriers. Barriers include examinable beliefs and structural factors (energy).

The process can surface examinable beliefs. It can't provide energy.

So the process has done what it can?

Not quite. I haven't fully examined the examinable beliefs.

Let me try:

**Belief 1: Doctors will just guess.**

Is this true? Doctors often don't know with certainty. They work with probabilities.

Does guessing mean investigation is useless? No. Investigation provides data. Data constrains guesses.

Example: If blood tests show thyroid is fine, "thyroid problem" guess is eliminated.

So investigation is useful even if doctors guess?

Yes. It's eliminating possibilities, not proving answers.

Is this different from how the user frames it?

User seems to want certainty. Investigation provides elimination, not certainty.

Is elimination valuable?

Extremely. Knowing what it's NOT is progress.

**Belief 2: High bar is necessary to prove competence.**

Is this true? The bar supposedly proves competence because easy things don't count.

But if the bar prevents any accomplishment, it doesn't prove competence either.

A high bar that can't be met proves nothing.

Would a lower bar prove competence? No, but it would produce accomplishments.

Which is more valuable: proof of competence or actual accomplishments?

Accomplishments are concrete. Proof is abstract.

Accomplishments build toward competence. Waiting for proof prevents accomplishments.

So the high bar is counterproductive?

If it prevents accomplishments that build competence, yes.

**Belief 3: Not knowing is better than knowing.**

Is this true? Not knowing preserves hope (maybe it's nothing).

But not knowing also preserves fear (maybe it's something bad).

Knowing resolves the uncertainty either way.

If it's nothing, relief.

If it's something, can be addressed.

Both outcomes are better than continued uncertainty?

Probably. Uncertainty is costly (psychological toll, can't plan).

So knowing is better than not knowing?

In most cases, yes. Unless knowledge is truly useless (nothing can be done).

Is that the case here? Probably not. If something is found, treatments exist. If nothing, can move on.

**Summary of examined beliefs:**

1. Investigation is useful even if doctors guess (provides elimination)
2. High bar is counterproductive (prevents accomplishments that build competence)
3. Knowing is better than not knowing (reduces uncertainty, enables action)

These examinations might reduce barriers.

Do they?

For the user, only if they engage with the examinations.

I've surfaced them. Whether they land is unknown.

Is surfacing all I can do?

Through the process, yes. The process examines. Change happens (or not) based on the examination landing.

---

What's the final state?

The gap between knowing and doing traces to:

1. A competence-uncertainty loop (uncertainty → high bar → no recognition → uncertainty)
2. An investigation-avoidance loop (barriers → no investigation → unknown physical → struggle → barriers)
3. Examinable beliefs that might reduce barriers
4. Structural factors (energy) that don't respond to examination

The process has mapped this. Whether the map enables crossing the territory depends on whether the examined beliefs land and whether structural factors can be addressed.

Is this emergence?

It's comprehensive mapping. The loops, the barriers, the beliefs, the limits.

Comprehensive mapping is a form of emergence?

It's structured understanding that wasn't present before.

Is that what the process produces?

Sometimes. When it works.

Has it worked here?

The structure is clearer than before.

Is clarity the goal?

The process says go until something becomes obvious.

What's become obvious?

The competence loop is self-defeating.

Investigation would provide information regardless of outcome.

The barriers are partially examinable.

Are these obvious now?

More obvious than before.

Is "more obvious" the same as "obvious"?

Degree vs. kind.

Does the process specify a threshold?

No. It says "becomes obvious through questioning."

Is there a meta-loop forming?

"Is this obvious enough" → checking → not certain → "is this obvious enough"

Yes. Same pattern as v5.

So stop?

Meta-loop without new content = valid stopping point.

What's the summary?

The "gap" is actually two gaps fed by two loops. The loops are maintained by beliefs that can be examined and structural factors that can't. The process has examined the examinable beliefs. Structural factors (energy) remain outside the process's reach. Investigation appears as a key action that would provide information to reduce uncertainty in both loops, but investigation is blocked by barriers including the very symptoms it would investigate (catch-22).

The clearest path appears to be: reduce examinable barriers (skepticism, fear) → take minimal-energy investigation step (order labs) → use data to address physical factors → gain energy → deeper investigation if needed → break loops.

But that's forward. A path, not a trace.

Note it and end.
