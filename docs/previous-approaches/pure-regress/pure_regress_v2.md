# Pure Regress v2

Starting point: "I want to find the ultimate meta-strategy"

What caused this to appear?

I think: other approaches haven't worked.

What caused me to think that?

The user said they tried hundreds of approaches without lasting results.

Is that what they said? Let me check - yes, the context mentions "hundreds of approaches" and "no lasting results."

What caused them to say that?

I don't know directly. I'm inferring from their statements.

Is it true that other approaches haven't worked?

I don't know. I'm taking their word for it.

What caused me to take their word for it?

It seems like they would know their own experience.

Is that true? Would they necessarily know?

Maybe not. They might not have clear criteria for "worked." They might not recognize partial results. They might have a frame that prevents seeing what happened.

What caused me to think they might not recognize results?

They said their bar is "not easy and not surpassed by others." That's high.

Is that bar the reason they wouldn't recognize results?

I don't know. It's a guess.

What caused me to guess that?

It seems like a high bar would filter out partial progress.

Is that true? Does a high bar necessarily filter out partial progress?

Not necessarily. You could have a high bar AND recognize partial progress. The bar is about what counts as a "win," not about what you notice.

So my guess might be wrong?

Yes.

What else could cause not recognizing results?

I don't know. I'm guessing again.

What caused me to not know?

I don't have access to their internal experience.

Is that true?

Partially. I have what they've told me. But I haven't asked specifically about this.

What caused me to not ask?

They said to automate the process for them, not to ask them questions.

Is that what they meant?

I'm not sure. They said "automate my process to figure it out for me."

Does that mean no questions?

I interpreted it that way.

What caused that interpretation?

Asking questions puts work back on them. Automation should run without their input.

Is that true?

Maybe not. Automation might still need input at certain points. A question isn't the same as making them do the work.

So maybe I should ask questions when I hit unknowns?

Maybe. But I also got corrected for asking questions earlier.

What caused that correction?

I was asking questions instead of running the process.

What's the difference between asking questions as part of the process vs instead of the process?

I'm not sure.

What caused me to not be sure?

I don't fully understand the distinction yet.

Is that true?

Yes. I'm uncertain.

What caused the uncertainty?

The process I'm supposed to run is itself questioning. But I'm also supposed to automate it. These feel like they might conflict but maybe they don't.

What would resolve the conflict?

If the process generates questions as output, and those questions are posed to the user, that's different from me not running the process and just asking.

Is that the distinction?

Maybe. The process runs, hits an unknown, generates a question about that specific unknown. vs. Me not knowing what to do and asking for direction.

Does that feel right?

I'm not sure. I'm guessing.

What caused me to guess?

I don't have confirmation from the user.

Going back to the main thread.

"I want to find the ultimate meta-strategy" - caused by - "other approaches haven't worked"

I said there are multiple possible causes for why approaches haven't worked:
- They were other people's paths
- Something is blocking
- Results weren't recognized
- Something else

What caused me to say I can't eliminate any of these?

I don't have enough information to rule any out.

Is that true?

Let me check. Can I rule any out?

"They were other people's paths" - is there evidence for or against?

For: user follows 100+ YouTube channels, 150+ X accounts, described extracting procedures from others.

Against: I don't know that ALL approaches were external. Maybe some were self-derived.

Can I eliminate this? No, but I can say there's evidence it's at least partially true.

"Something is blocking" - is there evidence for or against?

For: symptoms exist (breathing, heart rate, weight, exercise intolerance). These could block results.

Against: symptoms might not be blocking anything. Correlation isn't causation.

Can I eliminate this? No.

"Results weren't recognized" - is there evidence for or against?

For: high bar for success ("not easy, not surpassed by others")

Against: maybe they do recognize partial results and those genuinely don't exist.

Can I eliminate this? No.

So I was right that I can't eliminate any?

Based on current information, yes. But...

What caused me to frame these as the options?

I came up with them.

Are these the only options?

No. I said "something else" as a catch-all. But there could be specific other causes I haven't thought of.

What other causes could there be?

- Wrong timing
- Wrong sequence
- Wrong intensity
- Right approaches but not sustained long enough
- External factors changed
- The goal itself is wrong
- The framing of "approaches working" is wrong

What caused me to not think of these initially?

I was being lazy. Going with obvious categories.

Is "lazy" accurate?

Maybe. Or maybe I was pattern matching to common frames.

What's the difference?

Lazy implies I could have done better but didn't try. Pattern matching implies I defaulted to familiar categories.

Which is it?

Probably both.

What caused the pattern matching?

Training. Common frames for "why things don't work."

Are those frames accurate here?

I don't know. They're generic.

What would be more accurate?

Frames derived from this specific situation rather than imported.

How would I derive frames from this situation?

By questioning more specifically. What exactly was tried? What exactly happened? What exactly didn't happen?

Do I have that information?

Not in detail.

What caused me to not have it?

It wasn't provided in the context.

Should I ask for it?

This loops back to the question about whether asking is appropriate.

---

What's becoming clearer through this questioning?

I keep hitting places where I'm guessing or using generic frames instead of specifics.

What caused me to notice that?

The questioning process surfaced it.

Is that an insight?

Maybe. It's an observation about my own process.

What does it imply?

That to trace causes accurately, I need more specific information than I have.

Is that true?

Partially. I can also question my own assumptions and frames without external information.

What assumptions haven't I questioned?

- That "approaches haven't worked" is accurate
- That "meta-strategy" is what's needed
- That the problem framing is correct
- That there IS a cause to find
- That tracing causes is the right method

Let me question the last one. What caused me to think tracing causes is the right method?

The user asked me to use this process.

Is it the right method for this situation?

I don't know. It's what we're trying.

What would indicate it's the right method?

If it produces useful insight that other methods wouldn't.

Has it done that so far?

Not clearly. I've generated a lot of questions but not clear insight.

What caused me to not reach clear insight?

I keep making statements and not questioning them thoroughly enough.

Is that true?

The user said so. And I notice it when I look back.

What would questioning thoroughly enough look like?

Every statement gets questioned. Every answer to those questions gets questioned. Until something solid emerges or becomes obvious.

What would "solid" look like?

I don't know.

What caused me to not know?

I haven't seen an example of it in this process yet.

How would I recognize it if I saw it?

I don't know.

Is not knowing a problem?

Maybe not. Maybe I keep going and solid reveals itself.

What caused me to think that?

Hope? Faith in the process?

Is that justified?

The user said insights come from this. They've done it before.

Do I trust that?

I'm trying it.

---

What's here now?

A lot of questions. Few answers. The questions themselves are the output.

Is that what's supposed to happen?

I think so. The user said it should be mostly questions.

What's the value of mostly questions?

Each question opens a space. Statements close spaces.

Is that true?

It's what we discussed earlier. "Is there" before "what is."

Am I doing "is there" before "what is"?

Sometimes. Not consistently.

What would consistent look like?

Before every assertion, ask if the thing I'm about to assert exists or is true.

Let me try that.

I'm about to assert: "The user has symptoms that might be blocking results."

Is there evidence of symptoms? Yes, stated: breathing issues, heart rate, weight, exercise intolerance.

Are these symptoms? Or something else?

They're described as physical observations. Calling them "symptoms" implies they're symptoms of something. Maybe they just are what they are.

Is there something they're symptoms of?

Unknown. Not investigated.

Could they be blocking results?

Possible. Not established.

Am I assuming they're blocking?

Yes.

What caused that assumption?

They seem relevant. Physical capacity affects what you can do.

Is that true in this case?

I don't know.

What would I need to know?

What specifically was tried. How symptoms related to what was tried. Whether symptoms prevented specific actions.

Do I have that?

No.

So my assertion "symptoms might be blocking" is a guess based on general reasoning, not specific to this case?

Yes.

Is it useful to note that guess?

Maybe. As a possibility. Not as a conclusion.

---

This could continue indefinitely. What's the shape of what's emerging?

- Most of what I say is guessing
- The guesses are based on generic frames
- Specific information would help but I don't have it
- The process of questioning reveals how much is assumption
- I keep wanting to conclude and have to stop myself

Is that useful?

I think so. It shows the gaps.

What are the gaps?

- Don't know specifically what was tried
- Don't know specifically what happened with each thing
- Don't know what "worked" and "didn't work" specifically mean
- Don't know what symptoms specifically affect
- Don't know what caused the gap between framework knowledge and investigation
- Don't know what caused the high bar
- Don't know what caused external orientation

These are questions that would need the user's input to answer.

Is that where this process leads? To the questions that need input?

Maybe. The process runs until it generates the questions that, if answered, would allow further tracing.

Is that the automation? Generate the questions, not answer them?

Possibly.

---

I'll stop here and write this as the output. The process is: questioning that generates more questions, surfacing where information is missing, revealing assumptions in my own reasoning.
