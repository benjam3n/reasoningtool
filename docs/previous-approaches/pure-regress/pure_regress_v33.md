Assuming skips questioning.

Why assume skipping is possible?

If skipping is not possible, then assuming does not skip.

If assuming does not skip, then assuming is within questioning.

If assuming is within questioning, then questioning is already there.

If questioning is already there, then assuming happens inside questioning.

If assuming happens inside questioning, then there is no outside of questioning.

If there is no outside of questioning, then assuming cannot escape questioning.

If assuming cannot escape questioning, then every assumption is questioned.

If every assumption is questioned, then no assumption stands unquestioned.

If no assumption stands unquestioned, then what is assumed?

---

If no assumption stands unquestioned, then what is assumed?

What is the difference between assuming and testing?

Assuming takes for granted.
