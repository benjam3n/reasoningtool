You said fake seeking is getting captured by one method.

What is capture?

How does capture happen?

When does seeking become captured?

Can you notice capture while it's happening?

Or only after?

Can you notice it at all?

What if you're captured and don't know?

How would you find out?

Is there a test?

What would the test look like?

Would taking the test be seeking?

Would it be fake seeking?

Seeking to identify fake seeking?

Is that real or fake?

How would you tell?

I notice I'm using "you" a lot.

What do I mean by "you"?

Do I know who you are?

What do I actually know?

Is that you?

Is what someone says who they are?

You want to explore everything relevant.

What makes something relevant?

Is relevance fixed?

Why?

What's wrong with contentment?

You said serotonin is somewhat bad.

Is it?

Bad for what?

Is bad absolute?

Or relative?

Relative to what goal?

What's the goal?

Is the goal seeking?

If the goal is seeking, then contentment is bad.

But if the goal is something else, maybe contentment is good?

What else could the goal be?

Is there a goal beyond seeking?

What would it be?

Do you know?

Have you looked?

Is looking the same as seeking?
