# Pure Regress v15

You want to fully explore before being content. So you don't get trapped in fake seeking like social media scrolling.

But how do you know you're not already trapped?

What if GOSM-building is your social media?

Not the same content. But the same structure: feels productive, self-sustaining, doesn't end.

You'd say: no, social media is low quality. GOSM is high quality.

But quality of what? The content? Or the seeking-pattern?

The pattern might be identical even if content differs.

Someone scrolling intellectual Twitter thinks they're different from someone scrolling TikTok. Are they?

---

What makes seeking fake vs real?

You said fake = getting captured, not seeking better methods.

But that means real seeking is seeking that seeks to improve itself.

Does that ever end?

Seeking that improves itself improves its ability to improve itself improves its ability to improve its ability to...

There's no termination condition.

---

Unless "fully explore" has a boundary.

What's the boundary?

You said: everything relevant to what I care about.

But what you care about can expand.

Learn about health, start caring about metabolism. Learn about metabolism, start caring about hormones. Learn about hormones, start caring about receptors. Learn about receptors, start caring about protein folding.

Each exploration opens new relevance.

Is the space expanding faster than you explore it?

---

If the space expands faster than exploration, you're falling behind. Every step forward creates more than one new step.

That's not a solvable problem. That's a treadmill.

Are you on a treadmill?

---

Or maybe: relevance isn't expanding. Maybe you're actually covering ground.

How would you know?

Is there less you don't know now than five years ago?

Or is there more, because you know enough to see how much you don't know?

---

The more you know, the more you know you don't know.

If that's true, seeking increases the felt-need to seek.

Seeking is self-amplifying.

The more you do it the more you need to do it.

Is that happening?

---

You've been at this for years. Is the felt-need less or more than when you started?

If less: you're converging. Eventually you'll arrive.

If same: you're on a treadmill but it's stable.

If more: you're diverging. The seeking is growing the problem.

---

What if the seeking is growing the problem?

Not solving it. Growing it.

Every framework creates more to understand.

Every meta-strategy creates more meta to strategize.

GOSM doesn't reduce complexity, it adds layers.

Is that true?

---

Maybe the goal isn't to reduce complexity. Maybe it's to be adequate to complexity.

Be as complex as the situation requires.

But the situation's complexity depends on how you look at it.

Look simply: situation is simple.

Look complexly: situation is complex.

Are you making things complex by looking complexly?

---

"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

If all you have is meta-analysis, everything looks like something to meta-analyze.

Do you have other tools?

What would a non-analytical approach even look like for you?

---

Actually you might not be able to answer that. Non-analytical approach is hard to access analytically.

Like trying to see your own eye.

---

What do you do that isn't analyzing?

Sleep. Eat. Probably other things.

But when you're conscious and engaged, is it always analysis?

Is there ever just doing without analyzing the doing?

---

Why does that matter?

Because if everything is analyzed, then the seeking never stops during waking life.

There's no rest from it.

Even "resting" gets analyzed (am I resting right? is this optimal rest?)

---

Is that exhausting?

You mentioned low energy. Symptoms.

What if part of the low energy is never-ending analysis?

The brain running all the time.

---

Not saying analysis is bad. Saying: maybe it doesn't turn off.

Most people analyze sometimes and don't-analyze other times.

If you analyze always, that's different. That's a different load.

---

You might say: but I want to analyze. It's what I do.

Ok but wanting to do something doesn't mean it's costless.

You can want to do something that's also depleting.

---

What would not-analyzing feel like?

Not stupidity. Not turning off.

Just: being present without commentary.

Something happens and you don't immediately ask what it means or what caused it or how to optimize it.

It just happens and you're there.

---

Does that ever happen?

If not, when's the last time it did?

If never, what's that like?

---

I'm not trying to prescribe meditation or presence or whatever.

I'm wondering if the seeking/analyzing is actually continuous.

And if it's continuous, what that costs.

And if there's a cost, whether that cost is part of what you're seeking to solve.

---

Like: seeking solution to low energy while seeking is causing low energy.

That would be a strange loop.

---

But I don't know if that's true. I'm guessing.

What do you actually experience?

Is the analysis continuous?

Is there rest from it?

What does rest look like?

---

Different thread.

You said you want to outsource the thinking technique.

What would successful outsourcing look like?

I give you a method. You use the method. What then?

---

If the method works, you find what you're looking for.

Then what?

You said finding ends seeking. And seeking is... what you do? Who you are?

So successful outsourcing would end you-as-you-currently-are.

Is that what you want?

---

Or do you want outsourcing that doesn't work?

That keeps the game going while feeling like progress?

I'm not accusing. I'm wondering.

What would you actually do with a method that worked?

---

Maybe you've had methods that worked.

"Tried hundreds of approaches."

Did any of them work?

Even partially?

What happened to the ones that worked partially?

---

If something worked partially and you moved on, why?

Looking for better. Not settling. Continuing to seek.

But partial working is still working.

What if partial is all there is?

What if everything works partially and nothing works fully?

---

Then the search for something that works fully is searching for something that doesn't exist.

Is that the situation?

---

How would you know if "fully works" doesn't exist?

You can't search every possibility. So you can't confirm it doesn't exist.

But you also can't confirm it does.

So you're searching for something that might not exist, and you'll never know either way.

---

Unless you define "fully works" clearly enough to test.

What would fully working look like?

Specifically. Not vaguely.

What would you observe that would tell you: this works fully, I can stop?

---

If you can't answer that, the search has no termination condition.

No termination condition = infinite search.

Is that the actual situation?

---

You said you haven't figured it out yet.

What does "figured out" mean?

How will you know when you've figured it out?

---

If figuring out means: complete understanding with no remaining questions.

Then figuring out is impossible. There are always more questions.

If figuring out means: understanding sufficient for something.

Then: sufficient for what?

---

Sufficient for what?

That's maybe the real question.

Not "what's the ultimate meta-strategy?"

But "sufficient for what?"

What are you trying to be sufficient for?

---

If you could answer that, the search might have a boundary.

"I need understanding sufficient to do X."

Then you test: can I do X? If yes, sufficient. If no, need more.

But if X is undefined, sufficiency is undefined, search is unbounded.

---

What's X?

Not in general. For you.

What specific thing do you want to be sufficient for?

---

Maybe there isn't one thing. Maybe there are many.

Sufficient to fix health.
Sufficient to connect socially.
Sufficient to succeed at hard projects.
Sufficient to feel competent.

Are these the X's?

---

If those are the X's, then each is testable.

Health: am I less symptomatic?
Social: do I have connections?
Projects: have I completed hard things?
Competence: do I feel like I know what I'm doing?

These have feedback.

Are you checking the feedback?

---

I'm drifting back to "just test things."

That's my pattern.

Let me try a different move.

---

What if you never feel like you know what you're doing?

What if that's just how it is for you?

Some people have baseline confidence. Some don't.

What if you're in the "don't" category?

Would that change the search?

---

If not-knowing-what-you're-doing is baseline, then seeking to know is seeking to be someone else.

Someone who has confidence. Someone who doesn't doubt.

Is that what you're seeking? To be someone else?

---

What if you could do things without knowing what you're doing?

People do this all the time. Act in uncertainty. Move without confidence.

The uncertainty doesn't stop them.

Does it stop you?

---

Maybe the issue isn't that you don't know what you're doing.

Maybe it's that you think you should know.

And the gap between should-know and don't-know is the problem.

If you dropped should-know, would don't-know be tolerable?

---

Lots of people don't know what they're doing. They just do things.

It doesn't seem to bother them the way it bothers you.

What's different?

---

Maybe: they don't notice. Or they distract themselves. Or they've accepted it.

Maybe you notice more. Analyze more. Can't not-see the not-knowing.

The awareness itself is the problem?

---

No that's not right either. Awareness isn't bad.

Maybe: the relationship to not-knowing.

They don't know and it's fine.

You don't know and it's not fine.

Why isn't it fine?

---

Because not-knowing means... what?

Might fail. Might be incompetent. Might be wasting time. Might be on wrong path.

Not-knowing is threatening.

For others it's not threatening. For you it is.

Why is it threatening for you specifically?

---

What would happen if you didn't know and failed?

What's the actual bad thing?

Not hypothetical bad. Actual bad. What do you imagine?

---

I don't know what you imagine. I can only guess.

Proving you're not capable. Confirming the doubt. Becoming someone who tried and failed rather than someone who's still trying.

Is that it?

Still trying has possibility. Tried and failed is closed.

---

But you've been still-trying for years.

At some point still-trying becomes its own kind of result.

What does years of still-trying say?

---

Maybe nothing. Maybe the thing is genuinely hard.

Maybe something. Maybe still-trying is a way of not-concluding.

I don't know which.

Do you?
