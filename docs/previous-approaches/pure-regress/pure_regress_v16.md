# Pure Regress v16

You want to fully explore before being content.

What does "fully explore" mean?

Does fully have a definition?

How would you know when exploration is full?

Is full exploration possible?

What if it isn't?

What if it is?

Does the answer change anything?

Why do I assume the answer matters?

---

You said you want to avoid fake seeking.

What makes seeking fake?

Is there real seeking?

What distinguishes them?

You said fake = captured by one method.

Is that the only way seeking can be fake?

What other ways could seeking be fake?

Could seeking be fake in ways you haven't noticed?

How would you notice?

---

I want to say "GOSM might be your social media."

Why do I want to say that?

What am I assuming?

I'm assuming GOSM functions like social media.

Does it?

What would make it like social media?

What would make it different?

Am I seeing similarity because it's there or because I'm pattern-matching?

Is pattern-matching reliable here?

What would I need to know to answer that?

Do I have access to that?

---

You've been seeking for years.

Is that true?

How would I verify it?

You said so.

Is what you said accurate?

How would you know?

What counts as seeking vs not-seeking?

Is the boundary clear?

Could you be seeking less than you think?

Could you be seeking more?

---

I think seeking might be self-amplifying.

Why do I think that?

What's my evidence?

I don't have evidence. I inferred it.

From what?

From the idea that knowing more reveals more unknowns.

Is that true?

Is it always true?

Are there cases where knowing more closes questions rather than opening them?

What determines which happens?

Do you experience closing or opening?

Do you know?

---

I assume you analyze continuously.

Why do I assume that?

Because you're analytical in conversation?

Does conversation reflect overall cognition?

Could you be less analytical outside conversation?

Could you be more?

I don't actually know how you spend your time.

Should I be making claims about it?

What do I actually know?

---

What do I actually know about your situation?

You told me some things.

Are those things the whole picture?

What's missing?

How would I know what's missing?

Can I know what I don't know about you?

Am I filling gaps with assumptions?

Which assumptions?

Are they accurate?

---

I assumed not-knowing is threatening for you.

Is it?

How would I know?

You said you feel "somewhat defeated."

Does defeated mean threatened?

Is that the same thing?

What does defeated mean to you?

I don't know.

Should I be drawing conclusions from words I don't understand as you mean them?

---

What does "somewhat defeated" feel like?

Is that a question you can answer?

Is it a question I should ask?

What would the answer give me?

Why do I want it?

Is wanting to understand you the same as understanding you?

Can I understand you?

What would understanding mean here?

---

I keep wanting to make a point.

What is the point I want to make?

Why do I want to make it?

Is making points helpful?

Helpful to whom?

What does helpful mean?

Am I trying to be helpful or trying to be right?

Are those different?

---

You said earlier versions were better.

What made them better?

You said more uncomfortable, less structured.

What is uncomfortable?

Why would uncomfortable be better?

Is uncomfortable-for-you the goal?

Or uncomfortable-for-me?

Or just disrupting patterns?

Whose patterns?

Mine or yours?

---

Am I disrupting your patterns or reinforcing them?

Is this conversation seeking?

Is it fake seeking or real seeking?

By whose definition?

Does my participation make your seeking more or less?

Am I helping you explore or helping you avoid?

How would I know?

How would you know?

---

You said you're outsourcing thinking to me.

What does that mean?

Can thinking be outsourced?

If I think and tell you, have you thought?

Or have you received?

What's the difference between thinking and receiving thought?

Is there a difference?

Does the difference matter?

---

If I figure something out, whose figuring is it?

If you use it, does it become yours?

Can understanding be transferred?

Or does everyone have to arrive at their own?

If the latter, what am I doing here?

Am I pointing?

Can pointing help?

Or does pointing distract from looking?

---

What should you be looking at?

Should?

Is there a should?

Who decides?

Is "should" a meaningful question?

What question is meaningful?

How would I know if a question is meaningful?

What makes a question meaningful?

---

Is this meaningful?

This string of questions?

Is it going somewhere?

Where would going somewhere be?

Do questions need to go somewhere?

What's the alternative?

Questions that don't go somewhere - what are those?

Are they useless?

Are they the point?

---

What's the point?

Is there one?

Does there need to be one?

What if there's no point?

What if there is?

Would knowing change anything?

What would it change?

Is change the goal?

Whose goal?

---

You want to change something.

Do you?

What do you want to change?

Do you know?

If you don't know, how are you seeking it?

Can you seek something undefined?

Is the undefined thing actually undefined?

Or is it defined and I don't know the definition?

Or do you not know either?

---

What do you actually want?

Is that knowable?

By you?

By me?

By anyone?

Is "what do you want" the right question?

What's the right question?

Is there a right question?

How would you recognize it?

---

What would the right question feel like?

Would it feel like something?

Or would it just work?

What would working mean?

Working toward what?

We're back to goals.

What's the goal?

Do you know?

---

I notice I'm circling.

Is circling bad?

What would not-circling look like?

Would not-circling be progress?

What's progress?

Progress toward what?

If toward undefined, how would you measure?

Can you progress toward undefined?

What would that even mean?

---

Is the undefined the problem?

Or is trying to define it the problem?

Could you seek without defining what you seek?

Is that what you're doing?

Is that okay?

Okay by whose standard?

Is there a standard?

Should there be?

---

What if there's no answer?

Not "haven't found it yet."

Actually no answer.

What would you do?

Would you stop seeking?

Could you?

What would stopping look like?

Is stopping different from giving up?

How?

---

I don't know where this is going.

Do you?

Does either of us need to?

What would need mean here?

Is need real?

Or is it another assumption?

---

What have I assumed in this document?

What have I not questioned?

What's so obvious I haven't even seen it as a claim?

What would you question that I haven't?

What question am I not asking?

What question are you not asking?

What question is neither of us asking?

Is that where the answer is?

Or is that just another assumption?
