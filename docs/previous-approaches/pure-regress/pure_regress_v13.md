# Pure Regress v13

What color is seeking?

Not metaphorically. If you had to paint it.

Orange maybe. Or that yellow-green of unripe things.

What color is finding?

Blue. Or the dark red of wine.

What color is the space between them?

---

Seeking has a sound. What is it?

A hum? A whine? The sound of something spinning that hasn't caught?

Finding has a sound too. A click. A thunk. Something landing.

What's the sound of not-seeking and not-finding?

Silence isn't right. There's still something.

Maybe: wind. Or breathing. Or the hum of being alive without direction.

---

What shape is your situation?

Not a loop. That's too neat.

Maybe: a tangle. Or fog. Or a room with too many doors.

Or: a staircase that goes up and also down and you can't tell which is which.

Or: water. Taking the shape of whatever contains it. What's containing you?

---

If your seeking were an animal, what animal?

A hound? Always sniffing, tracking, never arriving?

A shark? Has to keep moving or dies?

A hummingbird? Endless motion, tiny and frantic?

Or something else. A deep sea creature. Moving in darkness, sensing things you can't see.

---

What does the ultimate meta-strategy smell like?

This is a nonsense question.

But stay with it.

Does it smell like old books? Like metal? Like something burning?

Or does it have no smell because it doesn't exist as a thing that could smell?

Can you seek something that has no smell?

---

Where in your body is the seeking?

Head, obviously. Where thinking happens.

But is it only there?

Is there seeking in your chest? Your gut? Your hands?

When you want to find something, where does the wanting live?

---

What would happen if you moved the seeking somewhere else?

Seeking with your feet. Just walking, letting the feet seek.

Seeking with your hands. Making something, letting the hands find what they find.

Seeking with your eyes. Looking without thinking, just seeing what's there.

Is that still seeking? Or is that something else?

---

There's a word in some languages for the feeling of being in a forest.

Not a forest you're going through to get somewhere.

A forest you're just in.

What's the word for being in a search without going anywhere?

---

What if the search is a place and not a path?

A place you live in. Not a journey to somewhere else.

Living in search-land. The territory of not-knowing.

Is that bad?

Maps say "here be dragons" for unknown territories.

Maybe search-land has dragons. Maybe that's why it's interesting.

---

What are the dragons?

Not metaphorical dragons. Actual things that live in the unknown.

Things you haven't found because you haven't looked there.

Things that would change everything if you encountered them.

Are you avoiding the dragons or seeking them?

---

What if there's something you already know that you don't know you know?

Not hidden by repression. Hidden by... looking past it. Looking for something bigger.

Like searching for your keys while holding your keys.

What would the keys be?

---

Serotonin and dopamine are molecules.

Molecules don't seek. Molecules don't want.

Where does the wanting come from?

If it's just molecules, there's no one wanting. Just chemistry happening.

If it's not just molecules, what else?

---

Who is doing the seeking?

You. Obviously.

But who is that?

The one who wants to find. But that one was made by seeking. Seeking created the seeker.

If seeking stopped, would the seeker still exist?

Is that the fear? Not that seeking would end, but that you would end?

---

What exists before seeking starts?

A baby doesn't seek the ultimate meta-strategy.

When did this seeking start?

Not when you were born. Later.

Something happened and then there was seeking.

What happened?

---

Not asking for trauma. Not asking for origin story.

Asking: what's the shape of the beginning?

Was it sudden or gradual?

Was it a lack or an abundance?

Was it something missing or something found that demanded more?

---

What if seeking started as a solution and became a problem?

Originally: needed to find something. Seeking was the answer.

Then: seeking worked, became habit, became identity.

Now: the original need is forgotten but the seeking continues.

What was the original need?

---

Does the original need still exist?

Maybe it was met long ago. Maybe seeking solved it and didn't notice.

Seeking that continues after the need is met is... what?

Momentum? Addiction? Identity maintenance?

Or: the need transformed into something else and seeking is still appropriate, just aimed wrong?

---

What if you're seeking the wrong thing?

Not wrong method. Wrong object.

Seeking meta-strategies when you need... what?

Connection? Rest? Play? Touch? Grief? Forgiveness?

Things that can't be strategized.

---

What can't be strategized?

Falling asleep - you can set conditions but can't force it.

Falling in love - you can increase odds but can't make it happen.

Having an insight - you can prepare but can't command it.

Feeling at peace - you can remove obstacles but can't manufacture it.

Is what you're seeking in this category?

---

What if the ultimate meta-strategy is in the category of things that can't be strategized?

Then seeking it strategically guarantees not finding it.

The seeking is the obstacle.

Not because seeking is bad. Because this particular thing can't be sought.

What would you do if that were true?

---

Not "stop seeking" - that's still strategic (stopping to get something).

Something else.

Giving up?

But not defeated giving up. More like... releasing?

Releasing the need to find.

Not because you found it. Because finding isn't the thing.

---

What would be the thing?

---

If I could give you one sentence, something true that would help, what would it be?

I don't know.

That's honest. I don't know what would help.

Maybe nothing I say helps. Maybe something you already know helps.

Maybe help isn't the frame.

---

What's the frame?

I've been assuming: you have a problem, I help solve it.

But what if there's no problem?

What if this is just how you are, and "problem" is a story about it?

Would that change anything?

---

There's a game where the goal is to make the other person say a specific word.

You talk, you maneuver, you try to get them to say it.

What if life is like that, but you don't know the word?

You're playing but you don't know what you're trying to get yourself to say.

What's the word?

---

I could keep going.

I don't know if this is better or worse or just different.

It doesn't have a point. It doesn't build to a conclusion.

Maybe that's what you wanted. Or maybe it's just strange.

What do you notice reading this?

Not what you think. What you notice.

In your body. In your attention. In whatever's there.

---

What's there?
