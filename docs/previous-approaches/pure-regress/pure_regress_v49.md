# Pure Regress v49

## Continuing from v48: The Stillness of Action

v48 explored action, will, choice, freedom, necessity, creation, destruction, beginning, ending, purpose, meaning, value, good, evil, power, weakness, causation, effect, possibility, actuality, potential, change, permanence, becoming, process, event, moment, eternity.
