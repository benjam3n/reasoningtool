# Universal: Commitment Dimensions (112)

**Category**: META - Multi-Dimensional Commitment Analysis
**Source**: [D: from observation that agreeability isn't linear]
**Structure**: One question per entry, CRUX-marked with realistic distribution
**Purpose**: Replace linear L1-L5 with multi-dimensional analysis

## The Problem with Linear Levels

L1-L5 treated agreeability as a single axis. But there are multiple independent dimensions:

- "I'm hungry" vs "You're hungry" (REFERENCE dimension)
- "We've been here" vs "We've been here a while" (PRECISION dimension)
- "In a room" vs "In a house" (FRAME dimension)
- "It exists" vs "It's good" (VALUE dimension)

A claim's committability depends on its position across ALL dimensions.

## The Dimensions

```
DIMENSION 1: REFERENCE (who/what is the claim about?)
├─ SELF         "I am hungry"        - Self-report, hard to deny about self
├─ OTHER_OBS    "You are sitting"    - Observable about others
├─ OTHER_INT    "You are hungry"     - Other's internal state (can't verify)
├─ EXTERNAL     "The file exists"    - External reality
└─ UNIVERSAL    "Reality exists"     - About everything

DIMENSION 2: PRECISION (how specific?)
├─ EXACT        "4 entries"          - Precise quantity
├─ BOUNDED      "3-5 entries"        - Range
├─ COMPARATIVE  "More than before"   - Relative
└─ VAGUE        "Several", "a while" - Imprecise

DIMENSION 3: FRAME (could it be stated differently?)
├─ NECESSARY    "A=A"                - No other way to say it
├─ NESTED       "Room" ⊂ "House"     - Valid at multiple levels
├─ PARALLEL     "Meeting"/"Chat"     - Different valid frames
└─ CONTESTED    People would disagree on frame

DIMENSION 4: VALUE (is it normative?)
├─ DESCRIPTIVE  "Sky is blue"        - No value claim
├─ PREFERENCE   "I prefer X"         - Personal value (OK if about self)
├─ INSTRUMENTAL "X is good for Y"    - Conditional value
└─ NORMATIVE    "X is good"          - Absolute value claim

DIMENSION 5: VERIFIABILITY (can it be checked?)
├─ IMMEDIATE    "File exists"        - Checkable now
├─ DELAYED      "Test will pass"     - Checkable later
├─ CRITERIA     "Working well"       - Depends on unstated criteria
└─ UNVERIFIABLE "They intended X"    - Can't check

DIMENSION 6: MODAL (what kind of necessity?)
├─ LOGICAL      "A=A"                - Logically necessary
├─ PHYSICAL     "Objects fall"       - Physically necessary
├─ CONTINGENT   "File has 4 entries" - Could be otherwise
└─ POSSIBLE     "Could work"         - Mere possibility
```

## Commitment Rule

**CAN COMMIT when ALL dimensions are at the "certain" end:**
- REFERENCE: SELF or UNIVERSAL
- PRECISION: EXACT or NECESSARY
- FRAME: NECESSARY
- VALUE: DESCRIPTIVE or PREFERENCE (about self)
- VERIFIABILITY: IMMEDIATE or LOGICAL
- MODAL: LOGICAL or verified CONTINGENT

**CANNOT COMMIT when ANY dimension is uncertain.**

## CRUX Rating Guide
- **HIGH** (10-25%): Wrong dimension assessment = arbitrary commitment
- **MED** (40-50%): Uncertain on dimension but reasonable
- **LOW** (30-40%): Minor dimension classification

# DIMENSION 1: REFERENCE

## Q1: Who or what is this claim about?
[D: Reference affects certainty - self-knowledge is different from other-knowledge]

| Entry | CRUX | Why This Rating | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| SELF - my internal state | LOW | Hard to be wrong about own feelings | Accept | Mistaken about self (rare) |
| SELF - my action | LOW | Direct knowledge | Accept | Misremembering |
| OTHER_OBSERVABLE - their visible state | MED | Can observe but might misinterpret | Verify by observation | Observation wrong |
| OTHER_INTERNAL - their feelings/thoughts | HIGH | Can't directly access | CANNOT commit - ask them | Might know |
| EXTERNAL - file, object, measurement | MED | Checkable | Verify by check | Check was wrong |
| UNIVERSAL - reality, logic, existence | LOW | Foundational | Accept | (would be incoherent) |

---

## Q2: Does reference type affect certainty?
[D: Self-reports vs claims about others]

| Entry | CRUX | Why This Rating | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|

# DIMENSION 3: FRAME

## Q5: Could this be stated in a different frame?
[D: "In a room" vs "in a house" - both true, different frames]

---

## Q6: Does frame choice affect conclusions?
[D: If different frames lead to different conclusions, frame is CRUX]

| Entry | CRUX | Why This Rating | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Same conclusion in all frames | LOW | Frame-independent truth | CAN commit | Conclusions differ |

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 14
ENTRIES: 82

CRUX Distribution:
- HIGH: 36 entries (44%)  ← High because dimension errors are dangerous
- MED: 32 entries (39%)
- LOW: 14 entries (17%)

THE SIX DIMENSIONS:
1. REFERENCE: Self → Other_Observable → Other_Internal → External → Universal
2. PRECISION: Exact → Bounded → Comparative → Vague
3. FRAME: Necessary → Nested → Parallel → Contested
4. VALUE: Descriptive → Preference (self) → Instrumental → Normative
5. VERIFIABILITY: Immediate → Delayed → Criteria-dependent → Unverifiable
6. MODAL: Logically necessary → Physical → Contingent verified → Possible

COMMITMENT RULE:
CAN commit only when ALL dimensions are at the "certain" end.
If ANY dimension is uncertain → CANNOT commit.

EXAMPLES:
"I'm hungry"
  - REFERENCE: Self ✓
  - PRECISION: Present state ✓
  - FRAME: No other frame ✓
  - VALUE: Descriptive ✓
  - VERIFIABILITY: Self-evident ✓
  - MODAL: Contingent but self-known ✓
  → CAN COMMIT (self-report)

"You're hungry"
  - REFERENCE: Other_Internal ✗
  → CANNOT COMMIT (even if other dimensions pass)

"We've been here a while"
  - REFERENCE: Self+Other ✓
  - PRECISION: "A while" is vague ✗
  → CANNOT COMMIT

"We've been here"
  - REFERENCE: Self+Other ✓
  - PRECISION: Location only, no duration ✓
  - FRAME: "Here" has nested frames (room/house/Earth) - note frame
  → Can commit with frame acknowledgment

"Making money is good"
  - VALUE: Normative ✗
  → CANNOT COMMIT

"I want to make money"
  - REFERENCE: Self ✓
  - VALUE: Preference (self) ✓
  → CAN COMMIT (self-report of preference)
```
