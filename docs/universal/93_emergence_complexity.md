## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Does the system adapt to interventions?

[VOI: HIGH - adaptive systems require fundamentally different approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Adaptive | HIGH | System will respond | Expect adaptation | Intervention triggers counter-response |
| Unknown adaptivity | MED | May adapt | Adaptivity check | Either over or underestimate response |
| Non-adaptive | LOW | Intervention works as expected | Direct intervention | System adapts, intervention fails |

---

## Q2: Is the system in equilibrium or transitioning?

[VOI: HIGH - transitioning systems are volatile and unpredictable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Transitioning | HIGH | Volatile, unpredictable | Adaptive planning | Steady state planning fails |
| Unstable equilibrium | HIGH | Could tip any direction | Extra caution | Assume stable, small push tips |
| Unknown state | MED | May be volatile | State analysis | Wrong planning approach |
| Stable equilibrium | LOW | Predictable | Steady state planning | Actually transitioning, volatility surprise |

---

## Q3: Are there tipping points we might cross?

[VOI: HIGH - tipping points create sudden regime change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tipping point nearby | HIGH | Sudden change possible | Caution near edge | Push past point, regime change |
| Unknown if tipping | MED | May tip | Tipping point analysis | Either over-cautious or blindsided |
| No tipping points | LOW | Continuous change | Gradual approach | Tip into new regime unexpectedly |

---

## Q4: Is the system deterministic or sensitive to initial conditions?

[VOI: HIGH - chaotic systems are fundamentally unpredictable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sensitive (chaotic) | HIGH | Unpredictable long-term | Short cycles, adaptation | Long-term plans fail |
| Unknown sensitivity | MED | May be chaotic | Sensitivity testing | Either over-plan or under-plan |
| Deterministic | LOW | Predictable | Long-term planning | Plans fail to chaos |

---

## Q5: Are there multiple stable states the system could be in?

[VOI: HIGH - multi-stable systems can flip and are hard to reverse]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Multiple stable states | HIGH | Could flip | Understand all states | Accidentally flip to bad state |
| Unknown stability structure | MED | May flip | State analysis | Surprised by state change |
| Single stable state | LOW | Predictable | Standard approach | Flip to different state |

---

## Q6: Is local optimization hurting global performance?

[VOI: HIGH - optimizing parts can de-optimize whole]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Local hurts global | HIGH | Must coordinate | System-level view | Each part improves, system worsens |
| Unknown alignment | MED | May be harming | Alignment check | Unknowingly degrading whole |
| Local aligns with global | LOW | Safe to optimize locally | Optimize parts | Parts win, whole loses |

---

## Q7: Is the whole more than the sum of its parts?

[VOI: HIGH - emergent properties can't be understood by parts alone]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Emergent properties | HIGH | Must understand interactions | Study whole and interactions | Reductionist approach fails |
| Unknown if emergent | MED | May miss properties | Emergence check | Either over or under analyze |
| Simple sum | LOW | Parts analysis sufficient | Analyze parts | Miss emergent properties |

---

## Q8: Are there feedback loops creating non-linear effects?

[VOI: MED - affects prediction but similar monitoring approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Amplifying loops | HIGH | Small input, large output | Leverage carefully | Small action, explosion |
| Dampening loops | MED | Resistance to change | More force needed | Expect easy change, meet resistance |
| Unknown loops | MED | May be surprised | Loop mapping | Either under or overreact |
| No significant loops | LOW | Linear prediction works | Linear models | Surprised by amplification |

---

## Q9: Are there unintended consequences we haven't considered?

[VOI: MED - affects thoroughness but similar planning process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Major unintended likely | MED | Will create problems | Map more thoroughly | Surprised by side effects |
| Unknown consequences | MED | May cause problems | Consequence mapping | Blindsided by side effects |
| Consequences mapped | LOW | Know effects | Proceed | Miss important consequences |

---

## Q10: Are there emergent behaviors no one intended?

[VOI: MED - affects control approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Emergent behaviors present | MED | System has own agency | Work with emergent | Fight emergence, fail |
| Unknown if emergent | MED | May be surprising | Behavior analysis | Surprised by system agency |
| Behaving as designed | LOW | Predictable | Design controls | Emergent behavior surprises |

---

## Q11: Is there time delay between action and effect?

[VOI: LOW - affects timing but similar intervention approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Delayed effect | LOW | Can't immediately verify | Act and wait | Over-correct before effect shows |
| Unknown delay | LOW | May over-correct | Delay estimation | Oscillation from over-correction |
| Immediate effect | LOW | Direct feedback | Act and observe | Overshoot from delayed effect |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Does system adapt? - requires different approach
2. Q2: Equilibrium or transitioning? - volatility
3. Q3: Tipping points? - sudden regime change
4. Q4: Chaotic? - fundamental unpredictability
5. Q5: Multiple stable states? - flip risk
6. Q6: Local hurts global? - coordination required
7. Q7: Emergent properties? - reductionism fails

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
8. Q8: Feedback loops? - non-linear effects
9. Q9: Unintended consequences? - thoroughness
10. Q10: Emergent behaviors? - control approach

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
11. Q11: Time delay? - timing detail

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ systems sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is there time delay between action and effect?" sounds important but has LOW VOI - you still do similar intervention work.

"Does the system adapt to interventions?" has HIGH VOI - adaptive systems require completely different strategies than static ones.
