---

## Q9: How reliable is our information?
[VOI: HIGH - unreliable source = don't trust]

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (How much does certainty matter?) - scope the need
2. **Q2** (Cost of being wrong) - stakes
3. **Q3** (Assumptions) - hidden assumptions
4. **Q4** (What's verified?) - foundation check
5. **Q5** (Evidence quality) - reliability
6. **Q6** (Can we reduce?) - is research worthwhile
7. **Q7** (Unknown unknowns) - blind spots
8. **Q8-Q10** (Volatility, reliability, currency)
9. **Q11** (Overall level) - summary

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Are our assumptions implicit?" routes to surfacing work vs proceeding. "Is uncertainty irreducible?" routes to decision under uncertainty vs research.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
