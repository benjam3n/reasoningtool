## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Abstract things (emotions, beliefs, evaluations) are infinitely malleable. Any X can become X+1.**

Unlike physical constraints, abstract concepts have no natural bounds:
- "Passion" → "Deep passion" → "True passion" → "Overwhelming passion"
- "Trust" → "Real trust" → "Complete trust" → "Absolute trust"
- "Good" → "Very good" → "Excellent" → "Perfect" → "Beyond perfect"

**The labels are arbitrary but the intensification is real.** Adding words like "deeper," "truer," "more," creates experiences of greater intensity.

This applies to:
- Emotions and feelings
- Beliefs and convictions
- Evaluations and judgments
- Commitments and intentions
- Experiences and perceptions

## Q1: Is this domain malleable?

[VOI: HIGH - malleable domains can be intensified, fixed domains cannot]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Malleable but treating as fixed | HIGH | Missing intensification potential | Utilize malleability | Accept limit that doesn't exist |
| Fixed but treating as malleable | HIGH | Wasted effort | Accept the limit | Push against real constraint |
| Unknown if malleable | MED | May be missing opportunity | Malleability test | Either fixed or malleable |
| Correctly identified | LOW | Approach matched | Continue | Actually misidentified |

## Q5: Is there a ceiling we're hitting?

[VOI: MED - perceived ceilings may be false]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| False ceiling (can be broken) | MED | Push through | Break through ceiling | Accept false limit |
| Real ceiling | MED | Must work within | Accept limit | Push against real limit |
| Unknown if ceiling is real | MED | May be accepting false limit | Ceiling test | Either push or accept |

---

## Q6: Does the receiver believe in malleability here?

[VOI: MED - their belief affects receptivity to amplification]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| They think it's fixed | MED | Must reframe first | Demonstrate malleability | Amplification rejected |
| Unknown their belief | MED | May have resistance | Belief check | Either receptive or resistant |
| They believe it's malleable | LOW | Amplification accepted | Proceed | Actually think fixed |

---

## Q7: Are we using the cascade effect?

[VOI: MED - cascading intensifies compounds]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not cascading | MED | Missing compound effect | Add cascade | Single level when could compound |
| Unknown if cascading | MED | May be missing | Cascade check | Either cascading or not |
| Cascading effectively | LOW | Compound effect active | Continue | Actually not cascading |

---

## Q8: What's the diminishing returns point?

[VOI: LOW - affects efficiency but similar direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Before diminishing returns | LOW | More amplification useful | Continue amplifying | Stop too early |
| At diminishing returns | LOW | Efficiency dropping | Shift approach | Either continue or shift |
| Past diminishing returns | LOW | Wasted effort | Stop amplifying | Waste effort |

---

## Q9: Can intensity be transferred?

[VOI: LOW - affects versatility but similar core]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can transfer intensity | LOW | Amplify here, apply there | Utilize transfer | Miss transfer opportunity |
| Cannot transfer | LOW | Must amplify each separately | Work domain by domain | Try to transfer, fail |
| Unknown if transferable | LOW | May be possible | Transfer test | Either transfer or not |

---

## Q10: Is contrast needed for amplification?

[VOI: LOW - affects technique but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Contrast helps | LOW | Use comparison | Build contrast | Miss contrast benefit |
| Contrast not needed | LOW | Direct amplification | Go direct | Unnecessary contrast |
| Unknown if contrast helps | LOW | May be missing | Contrast test | Either use or not |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Domain malleable? - amplification possible
2. Q2: Current intensity? - room to grow
3. Q3: Right intensification language? - technique

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
4. Q4: Can create new levels? - extension
5. Q5: Hitting ceiling? - limits
6. Q6: Receiver believes malleable? - receptivity
7. Q7: Using cascade? - compound effect

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Diminishing returns? - efficiency
9. Q9: Intensity transferable? - versatility
10. Q10: Contrast needed? - technique

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is contrast needed for amplification?" is a technique question with LOW VOI - you try it either way.

"Is this domain malleable?" has HIGH VOI - if fixed, you accept the limit; if malleable, you can amplify infinitely.

## The X → X+1 Principle

From Fuentes: Any emotion or evaluation can be intensified through language.

**Example dialogue**:
"Yes, overwhelming, irresistible passion is wondrous... and now imagine feeling that more intensely than ever before! Feel a deeper, overwhelming, irresistible passion!"

X (passion) → X+1 (deeper passion)

**Why this works**:
- Abstract concepts have no natural bounds
- Language creates and modifies internal experience
- "Deeper" is just a word, but the intensification is experientially real
- Each new label creates a new level that can itself be intensified

---

## The Infinite Hierarchy

**Physical things**: Bounded, limited
- A rock is a rock
- 10 feet is 10 feet
- Can't amplify physical constraints

**Abstract things**: Unbounded, infinite
- "Love" → "True love" → "The deepest love" → "Love beyond anything you've felt"
- Each level is arbitrary but experientially real
- No natural stopping point

**The cascade**:
```
Emotion X → Emotion Y → Emotion Z → Emotion N
```
As N increases, emotions become more abstract and more influential.

## Malleability Domains

**Highly malleable** (infinite amplification):
- Emotions and feelings
- Beliefs and convictions
- Evaluations and judgments
- Experiences and perceptions
- Commitments and intentions

**Less malleable** (physical constraints):
- Time
- Money
- Physical resources
- Skills (without practice)

**The trap:** Treating malleable things as fixed. "This is as good as it can be" when "deeper" or "truer" or "more" could amplify it further.

**The move:** For any abstract X, you can create X+1 through language. Add intensification words and the experience intensifies. The labels are arbitrary; the experience is real.
