# Universal: Change Management (84)

**Category**: CORE - Navigating Transitions
**Source**: New category not in YAML - essential for goals requiring behavior/system change
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Is there awareness that change is needed?
[VOI: HIGH - unaware will resist vs aware enables discussion]

## Q2: Is there desire to change (not just awareness)?

| No, not reinforced | HIGH | Add reinforcement vs expect sustainability | Add reinforcement | Change "doesn't stick" = no reinforcement |
| Unknown reinforcement | MED | Reinforcement check vs proceed | Reinforcement check | Changed briefly, old habits return |
| Yes, reinforced | LOW | Maintain reinforcement | Maintain reinforcement | Remove support too early, regression |

---

## Q6: What is being lost in this change?
[VOI: HIGH - loss not acknowledged creates hidden resistance vs acknowledged enables grieving]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Loss not acknowledged | HIGH | Acknowledge loss vs dismiss concerns | Acknowledge loss | Dismiss legitimate concerns as "resistance" |
| Unknown what's lost | MED | Loss discovery vs proceed | Loss discovery | Unexplained resistance from unacknowledged loss |
| Loss identified and acknowledged | LOW | Support transition | Support transition | Think no loss, blindsided by grief reactions |

---

## Q7: Where is the person on the change curve (denial, resistance, exploration, commitment)?
[VOI: HIGH - denial/resistance require different interventions than exploration/commitment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Denial | HIGH | Build awareness, don't push vs execute | Build awareness, don't push | Skip to execution, backfire |
| Resistance | HIGH | Listen and validate vs fight opposition | Listen and validate | Fight resistance, entrench opposition |
| Unknown stage | MED | Stage assessment vs one-size-fits-all | Stage assessment | One-size-fits-all approach fails |
| Exploration | MED | Support experiments vs pressure | Support experiments | Pressure for commitment, rush backward |
| Commitment | LOW | Reinforce vs question | Reinforce | Assume commitment when actually exploring |

---

## Q8: Are the systems/processes aligned with the change?
[VOI: HIGH - misaligned systems fight change vs aligned systems support it]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, misaligned | HIGH | Align systems vs expect behavior change | Align systems | Blame people when system is the problem |
| Unknown alignment | MED | System alignment check vs proceed | System alignment check | Wonder why change fails despite buy-in |
| Yes, aligned | LOW | Maintain systems | Maintain | Systems sabotage change you think they support |

---

## Q9: Is there coalition of support for the change?
[VOI: HIGH - weak coalition means isolated failure vs strong coalition enables momentum]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Weak coalition | HIGH | Build coalition first vs crusade alone | Build coalition first | Crusade alone, burn out or fail |
| Unknown coalition | MED | Coalition mapping vs proceed | Coalition mapping | Surprised no one follows |
| Strong coalition | LOW | Leverage coalition | Leverage coalition | Coalition smaller than thought, overextend |

---

## Q10: Is change being anchored in culture?
[VOI: HIGH - not anchored means reversion when attention moves vs anchored persists]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, not anchored | HIGH | Anchor in culture vs move on | Anchor in culture | Move on too soon, lose gains |
| Unknown if anchored | MED | Anchoring check vs proceed | Anchoring check | Victory declared, change erodes silently |
| Yes, anchored | LOW | Will persist, maintain | Maintain | Think anchored, reverts when champion leaves |

---

## Q11: Are there quick wins to build momentum?
[VOI: MED - quick wins build belief vs no quick wins requires expectation management]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No quick wins | MED | Manage expectations vs expect quick results | Manage expectations | Expect quick results from slow change |
| Unknown if quick wins | MED | Quick win identification vs proceed | Quick win identification | Long delay to first success, lose support |
| Quick wins available | LOW | Capture and publicize | Capture and publicize | Miss easy wins, lose momentum |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Aware? Desire? - readiness
- Q7: Stage? - where they are on curve
- Q8-Q9: Systems aligned? Coalition? - environment
- Q3-Q5: Knowledge, ability, reinforcement? - capability
- Q6, Q10: Loss acknowledged? Anchored? - sustainability

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q11: Quick wins - momentum building

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ change management best practice importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (build awareness vs execute, align systems vs expect behavior, anchor in culture vs move on). Low VOI questions optimize timing within an established change approach.
