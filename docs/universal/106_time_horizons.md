# Universal: Time Horizons (106)

**Category**: META - Which Time Horizons Are Relevant
**Source**: Derived from space discovery Step 3 - time frames that matter
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

## Why This Exists

08_when_time.md covers time precision (deadline, duration)
95_time_temporality.md covers time dynamics (windows, cycles)

This file covers which TIME HORIZONS are relevant to consider - a different question from "when is the deadline?"

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Is the IMMEDIATE time horizon (now, this moment) relevant?

[VOI: HIGH - determines crisis mode vs. normal planning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

| Unknown if immediate | MED | Check urgency vs. proceed | May be crisis | Miss crisis or false alarm |
| No, immediate not relevant | LOW | Normal planning vs. rush | Can plan | Rush when can relax |

---

## Q2: Is the SHORT-TERM horizon (days to weeks) relevant?

## Q5: Is the HISTORICAL CONTEXT (what led here) relevant?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether to study history or fresh start]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| History misleading | HIGH | Fresh analysis vs. apply past | Conditions changed | Apply outdated patterns |
| Yes, history matters | MED | Study history vs. ignore | Learn from past | Repeat past mistakes |
| Unknown if history matters | MED | History check vs. proceed | May repeat mistakes | Ignore useful or apply stale |
| No, history not relevant | LOW | Fresh start vs. research | Move forward | Miss patterns from history |

---

## Q6: Are CYCLICAL PATTERNS (what repeats) relevant?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether to leverage/avoid cycle timing]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cycle is breaking | HIGH | Adapt to new vs. expect old | Pattern changing | Expect old cycle, surprised |
| Yes, cycles exist | MED | Leverage cycle timing | Predictable pattern | Miss cycle, poor timing |
| Unknown if cyclical | MED | Cycle analysis vs. proceed | May miss pattern | Either miss or falsely expect |
| No, not cyclical | LOW | Treat as novel vs. seek pattern | Each time unique | Look for cycles not there |

---

## Q7: Is IRREVERSIBILITY (point of no return) relevant?

[VOI: HIGH - determines decision-making approach (careful vs. fast)]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, irreversible choice | HIGH | Decide carefully vs. move fast | One-way door | Treat irreversible as reversible |
| Unknown if irreversible | HIGH | Reversibility check vs. proceed | May be stuck | Commit to irreversible unknowingly |
| Partially reversible | MED | Assess reversal cost vs. binary | Some cost to undo | Either too cautious or too fast |
| No, reversible | LOW | Move faster vs. over-cautious | Can undo | Over-cautious on reversible |

---

## Q8: Which horizons should we PRIORITIZE?

[VOI: HIGH - determines focus and resource allocation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Different horizons conflict | HIGH | Navigate tension vs. ignore | Tension exists | Ignore conflict, fail both |
| Single horizon focus | MED | Deep on one vs. spread | Clear priority | Miss other horizons |
| Unknown priority | MED | Priority analysis vs. arbitrary | May focus wrong | Arbitrary focus |
| Multiple horizons equal | LOW | Balanced attention vs. prioritize | Spread effort | Under-serve each |

---

## Q9: Are horizons DIFFERENT for different stakeholders?

[VOI: HIGH - determines stakeholder negotiation approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conflicting perspectives | HIGH | Explicit negotiation vs. impose | Must choose or compromise | One party's horizon dominates silently |
| Yes, different perspectives | MED | Acknowledge differences vs. impose | Must reconcile | Impose single horizon |
| Unknown if different | MED | Perspective check vs. proceed | May cause friction | Surprise conflicts |
| No, aligned perspectives | LOW | Unified approach vs. differentiate | Easy agreement | Miss hidden differences |

---

## Q10: How does TIME HORIZON affect the SOLUTION?

[VOI: HIGH - determines solution design (quick fix vs. durable)]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Horizon unclear | HIGH | Horizon first vs. design blind | Solution may mismatch | Solution mismatched to need |
| Short horizon = quick fix | MED | Speed over durability | Fast solution | Over-engineer for short-term |
| Long horizon = durable fix | MED | Durability over speed | Robust solution | Fragile for long-term |
| Mixed horizon = phased | MED | Both quick and durable | Phase approach | Neither quick nor durable |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (Ask First - Changes Strategy Entirely)**
1. Q1: Immediate horizon - crisis mode vs. normal planning
2. Q7: Irreversibility - careful vs. fast decision approach
3. Q4: Long-term horizon - strategic vs. tactical
4. Q5: Historical context - study history vs. fresh start
5. Q6: Cyclical patterns - leverage timing vs. ignore
6. Q8: Horizon conflicts - navigate tension vs. single focus
7. Q9: Stakeholder horizons - negotiate vs. impose
8. Q10: Solution design - match to horizon

**MED VOI (Ask Second - Refine Approach)**
9. Q2: Short-term horizon - prioritization
10. Q3: Medium-term horizon - project planning

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Time Span Importance**. A long time horizon isn't automatically HIGH VOI.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. HIGH VOI means: if you're wrong about which horizon matters, you'll design a completely mismatched solution (e.g., building permanent infrastructure for a temporary problem).

## Usage Note

This category covers WHICH time horizons are relevant, distinct from:
- 08_when_time.md - precision, deadlines, duration (specific timing)
- 95_time_temporality.md - dynamics, windows, cycles (how time works)

→ Use this when deciding which horizons to consider in analysis
