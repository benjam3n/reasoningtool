## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is there actually a problem (gap between current and desired)?
[VOI: HIGH - Situation not problem means accept, wasted effort vs solve]

## Q2: What specifically is the gap?
[VOI: HIGH - Gap vaguely defined/unknown means solving wrong, clarify vs close gap]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Gap vaguely defined | HIGH | Clarify gap vs close | Clarify gap | Gap clear |
| Unknown gap | HIGH | Gap definition vs solve | Gap definition | Gap known |
| Gap clearly defined | LOW | Can target either way | Close gap | Gap unclear |

---

## Q3: Whose problem is this?
[VOI: HIGH - Unclear ownership means may not get solved, clarify vs solve]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unclear ownership | HIGH | Clarify ownership vs solve | Clarify ownership | Ownership clear |
| Someone else's problem | MED | Verify ownership vs solve | Verify ownership | My problem |
| Shared problem | MED | Coordinate vs solo | Joint solving | Single owner |
| My problem | LOW | I should solve either way | Solve it | Not my problem |

---

## Q4: Who has authority to implement solutions?
[VOI: HIGH - Authority unclear means may be blocked, clarify vs implement]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Authority unclear | HIGH | Clarify authority vs implement | Clarify authority | Authority clear |
| Others have authority | MED | Get authorization vs implement | Get authorization | I have authority |
| I have authority | LOW | Can implement either way | Implement | Don't have authority |

---

## Q5: What caused the problem?
[VOI: HIGH - Symptom/unknown cause means will recur, find root cause vs fix]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Symptom identified | HIGH | Find root cause vs fix symptom | Find root cause | Root cause |
| Unknown cause | HIGH | Root cause analysis vs guess | Root cause analysis | Cause known |
| Multiple causes | MED | Multi-pronged fix vs single | Address all | Single cause |
| Root cause identified | LOW | Can address either way | Fix root cause | Wrong cause |

---

## Q6: Is this the actual cause or symptom of deeper cause?
[VOI: HIGH - Symptom of deeper means need to go deeper vs fix]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Symptom of deeper | HIGH | Go deeper vs fix | 5 whys | Actual cause |
| Unknown depth | MED | Depth check vs assume | Depth check | Depth known |
| Actual root cause | LOW | Fix will last either way | Fix it | Symptom |

---

## Q7: Are there known solutions to this type of problem?
[VOI: HIGH - No known solutions means innovation needed vs apply known]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No known solutions | HIGH | Create solution vs apply | Create solution | Solutions exist |
| Unknown if solutions | MED | Solution search vs reinvent | Solution search | Solutions known |
| Yes, experimental | MED | Try with caution vs proven | Try with caution | Different status |
| Yes, proven solutions | LOW | Apply them either way | Use known solution | No known |

---

## Q8: Does solution address root cause or just symptoms?
[VOI: HIGH - Addresses symptoms means will recur, find better vs implement]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Addresses symptoms | HIGH | Find better vs implement | Find better | Addresses root |
| Unknown what addressed | MED | Analysis vs assume | Analysis | Target known |
| Addresses both | MED | Comprehensive vs focused | Implement | One or other |
| Addresses root cause | LOW | Lasting fix either way | Implement | Addresses symptom |

---

## Q9: Can this problem recur after being solved?
[VOI: HIGH - Likely to recur means need prevention vs one-time fix]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, likely to recur | HIGH | Add prevention vs fix once | Add prevention | Won't recur |
| Unknown if recurs | MED | Recurrence check vs assume | Recurrence check | Recurrence known |
| Unlikely to recur | LOW | One-time fix either way | Fix once | May recur |

---

## Q10: Can cause of recurrence be eliminated?
[VOI: MED - Determines permanent vs recurring fix but both solve problem]
Prerequisite: Q9 shows recurrence possible

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown if eliminable | MED | Eliminability check vs assume | Eliminability check | Eliminability known |
| Yes, can eliminate | MED | Permanent fix vs accept | Eliminate cause | Cannot |
| Can reduce frequency | MED | Improvement vs accept | Reduce | Different level |
| Cannot eliminate | MED | Prepare for repeat vs try | Prepare for repeat | Can eliminate |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Problem? (Situation → accept vs solve)
2. Q2: Gap? (Vague/unknown → clarify vs close)
3. Q3: Ownership? (Unclear → clarify vs solve)
4. Q4: Authority? (Unclear → clarify vs implement)
5. Q5: Cause? (Symptom/unknown → root cause vs fix)
6. Q6: Depth? (Symptom of deeper → go deeper vs fix)
7. Q7: Solutions exist? (No → create vs apply)
8. Q8: Root or symptom? (Symptom → find better vs implement)
9. Q9: Recur? (Likely → add prevention vs fix once)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
10. Q10: Eliminable? (Refinement, not direction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Problem Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI problem solving question is one where the answer determines whether you SOLVE THE PROBLEM or DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT (accept, clarify, find root cause). "Situation not problem" routes you to "accept the situation" - a completely different action than "solve the problem."

A LOW VOI problem solving question like "root cause identified vs not" doesn't change your fundamental approach when identified - you'll fix it either way, just with different confidence.
