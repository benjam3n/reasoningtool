**Category**: META - When "Good Enough" Is Better Than "Best"
**Source**: Herbert Simon's bounded rationality, decision theory
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is finding "best" even possible in this domain?

[VOI: HIGH - impossible optimization = must satisfice]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Best is impossible/undefined | HIGH | Maximizing is pointless | Satisfice | Seek impossible optimum |
| Unknown if possible | MED | May waste effort | Possibility analysis | Either waste effort or give up early |
| Best is findable | LOW | Can maximize | Optimize if worth it | Satisfice when best findable |

---

## Q2: Does the cost of finding "best" exceed the value difference?

[VOI: HIGH - search cost > improvement value = satisfice]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Search cost exceeds value | HIGH | Negative ROI on search | Take good enough | Waste resources on marginal improvement |
| Unknown cost/value ratio | MED | May misallocate | Ratio calculation | Either over-search or under-search |
| Value exceeds search cost | LOW | Worth maximizing | Continue searching | Satisfice when should optimize |

---

## Q3: Is this a one-shot or repeated decision?

[VOI: HIGH - repeated decisions compound small improvements]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| One-shot decision | MED | Small improvement doesn't compound | Satisfice | Over-optimize one-time choice |
| Unknown frequency | MED | May misallocate effort | Frequency analysis | Either over or under invest |
| Repeated decision | HIGH | Small improvements compound | Maximize, systemize | Satisfice what compounds |

## Q4: Are we maximizing in one dimension while satisficing matters more in another?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong dimension = wrong optimization target]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Maximizing wrong dimension | HIGH | Misallocated effort | Shift focus | Perfect on wrong thing |
| Unknown if right dimension | MED | May be misdirected | Dimension check | Either misdirected or paranoid |
| Maximizing right dimension | LOW | Well-targeted | Continue | Actually wrong dimension |

---

## Q5: What's the threshold for "good enough"?

[VOI: HIGH - undefined threshold = can't satisfice effectively]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Threshold undefined | HIGH | Can't know when to stop | Define threshold | Either never stop or stop arbitrarily |
| Threshold too high | MED | Effectively maximizing | Lower threshold | Satisfice in name, maximize in practice |
| Threshold appropriate | LOW | Can evaluate options | Use threshold | Threshold wrong |
| Threshold too low | MED | Accepting substandard | Raise threshold | Accept poor quality |

---

## Q6: Is decision fatigue a factor?

[VOI: MED - fatigue affects strategy but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Decision fatigue present | MED | Conserve capacity | Satisfice to preserve energy | Burn out on minor decisions |
| Unknown fatigue level | MED | May be depleted | Fatigue check | Either burn out or under-utilize |
| No fatigue issue | LOW | Full capacity | Maximize where valuable | Satisfice unnecessarily |

---

## Q7: Is there option paralysis from too many choices?

[VOI: MED - paralysis requires intervention]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Paralyzed by options | MED | Action blocked | Set threshold, choose | Stay paralyzed |
| Unknown if paralyzed | MED | May be stuck | Paralysis check | Either stuck or premature |
| Not paralyzed | LOW | Processing fine | Continue evaluating | Actually paralyzed |

---

## Q8: Will satisficing lead to regret?

[VOI: MED - regret affects decision comfort but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will regret satisficing | MED | Maximize | Keep searching | Satisfice with regret |
| Unknown regret | LOW | Can't assess | Regret analysis | Either regret or over-search |
| Won't regret satisficing | LOW | Comfortable | Satisfice confidently | Regret later |

---

## Q9: Does maximizing signal something important?

[VOI: LOW - signaling affects perception but similar decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Signaling matters | LOW | Must be seen maximizing | Maximize visibly | Miss signaling opportunity |
| Unknown if signaling matters | LOW | May miss perception | Signaling check | Either over-perform or miss signal |
| Signaling irrelevant | LOW | Pure utility | Satisfice freely | Signal when should maximize |

---

## Q10: Is perfectionism driving the urge to maximize?

[VOI: LOW - motivation check but similar decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Perfectionism driving | LOW | Psychological not rational | Address perfectionism | Continue perfectionist search |
| Unknown if perfectionism | LOW | May be irrational | Motivation check | Either perfectionist or legitimate |
| Legitimate maximizing | LOW | Rational | Continue | Actually perfectionism |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Is best possible? - fundamental feasibility
2. Q2: Cost vs value? - ROI of maximizing
3. Q3: One-shot or repeated? - compounding
4. Q4: Right dimension? - optimization target
5. Q5: Threshold defined? - stopping criteria

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Decision fatigue? - capacity preservation
7. Q7: Option paralysis? - action blockage
8. Q8: Will regret? - comfort level

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Signaling matters? - perception
10. Q10: Perfectionism? - motivation

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological depth about decision-making. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is perfectionism driving this?" is a useful introspection but has LOW VOI - you make a similar decision either way.

"Does the cost of finding best exceed the value difference?" has HIGH VOI - if yes, stop searching immediately.

## Simon's Satisficing Principle

Herbert Simon won the Nobel Prize partly for recognizing: humans can't maximize, and shouldn't try.

**Maximizing assumption**: Compare all options, pick best.
**Reality**: Infinite options, limited time, computational costs.

**Satisficing**: Set a threshold. Accept first option meeting it.

The key insight: The threshold itself needs calibration.
- Too high: You're actually maximizing (searching forever)
- Too low: You're accepting substandard
- Just right: You stop when you hit "good enough"

Most people's thresholds are too high. Lower your bar, move faster.
