## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (Ask First - Changes Validation Approach Entirely)**

2. Q7: Intentional claim - verify directly vs. accept inference
3. Q2: Causal claim - test mechanism vs. track correlation
4. Q1: Factual claim - evidence-based vs. debate-based
5. Q3: Predictive claim - challenge certainty vs. trust forecast
6. Q5: Modal claim - challenge constraints vs. accept limits
7. Q6: Relational claim - verify connection vs. accept
8. Q8: Meta claim - handle self-reference vs. direct treatment
9. Q9: Categorical claim - challenge reification vs. accept category

**MED VOI (Ask Second - Refine Approach)**
10. Q10: Quantitative claim - precision level
11. Q11: Temporal claim - timing verification

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Complexity**. A claim type can be complex but LOW VOI if misidentifying it leads to same actions.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. HIGH VOI means: if you misidentify this claim type, you'll use completely wrong validation methods.

## Usage Note

This category helps correctly classify what type of claim is being made. Different claim types require different validation approaches. Misidentifying claim type leads to wrong validation method.

Critical pairings:
- Factual claims → verify with evidence
- Causal claims → test mechanism
- Predictive claims → assess reasoning
- Normative claims → identify values
- Modal claims → explore possibility space
- Intentional claims → verify with source
- Meta claims → handle self-reference
