## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q4: What is the precise definition of 'done'? (fundamental)
2. Q7: What is the actual need this goal serves? (is this the right goal)
3. Q10: Is there a different goal with fewer requirements? (better option)
4. Q5: Is this single or bundled goals? (targeting wrong thing)
5. Q12: What assumptions does this goal contain? (what could undermine)
6. Q9: What is the cost of never achieving this? (why bother)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: What is the specific end state? (clarity)
8. Q6: What is explicitly excluded? (scope)
9. Q8: What decisions would change? (impact)
10. Q2: What will exist that doesn't now? (creation)
11. Q3: What will cease to exist? (removal)
12. Q11: Who created this goal? (origin)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is there a better alternative?" is HIGH VOI because YES → switch goals entirely, NO → commit to current. These are opposite directions.

Goal definition errors are particularly costly because they mean solving the wrong problem entirely. That's why this category has higher HIGH% than average.

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 12
GUESSES: 55

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 17 guesses (31%)
- MED: 24 guesses (44%)
- LOW: 14 guesses (25%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because goal definition errors = solving wrong problem

HIGH-VOI Entries (ask first):
- Q1: Vague / Unknown end state - don't know when done
- Q2: Nothing new / Unknown - can't plan work
- Q3: Relationships to sever - relationship impact
- Q4: Ambiguous / No / Disputed definition - don't know when done
- Q5: Multiple bundled / Unclear - targeting wrong thing
- Q6: No exclusions - unbounded scope
- Q7: No clear need / Unknown - why pursue?
- Q8: No decisions change - why pursue?
- Q9: Low / No / Unknown cost - why bother?
- Q10: Yes better alternative / Unknown - wrong goal
- Q11: Societal expectation - may not apply
- Q12: Hidden / Wrong / Unknown assumptions - may undermine
