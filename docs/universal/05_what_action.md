# Universal: What Is The Action (05)

**Category**: CORE DIMENSIONS - Action/Verb
**Source**: [D: CORE DIMENSIONS - Action (what is done)]
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Reversibility?) - can we undo if wrong?
2. **Q2** (Urgency?) - how much time to plan?
3. **Q3** (Success criteria?) - how do we know we're done?
4. **Q4** (Constraints?) - what's not allowed?
5. **Q5** (Goal relationship?) - is this action worthwhile?
6. **Q8** (Risk?) - catastrophic potential?
7. **Q6-Q7** (Resources, skills) - do we have what's needed?
8. **Q9-Q14** (Details as needed)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is this action irreversible?" routes to extensive validation vs quick iteration. "Is this action prohibited?" routes to finding alternatives vs proceeding.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
