# Universal: Interpretation Frames (104)

**Category**: META - What Frame Am I Using To Interpret This
**Source**: Derived from space discovery - all possible framings
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Am I using the frame the speaker intended?

[VOI: HIGH - misaligned frames = solving wrong problem]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, misaligned | HIGH | Miscommunication | Realign | Solve wrong problem |
| Unknown | HIGH | Need to check | Ask/verify | Assume alignment wrongly |
| Intentionally different | MED | Deliberate reframe | May be useful | Confusion possible |
| Yes, aligned | LOW | Communicating | Proceed | May still misunderstand |

---

## Q2: Am I using my frame or adopting theirs?

[VOI: HIGH - whose frame determines direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| My frame imposed | HIGH | Projecting | May be useful insight | May not fit their situation |
| Unknown whose frame | HIGH | Confusion | Identify source | Act on unclear frame |
| Their frame adopted | MED | Empathy | Understand them | May share their blindspots |
| Explicit negotiation | LOW | Aligned frames | Clear communication | Slow process |

---

## Q3: Am I using a surface or deep reading?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong depth = miss the actual issue]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Surface pretending to be deep | HIGH | Pseudo-profundity | Challenge | Accept false depth |
| Deep but appears surface | HIGH | Hidden complexity | Dig deeper | Miss important depth |
| Surface | MED | Obvious meaning | Quick response | Miss underlying issue |
| Deep | MED | Hidden meaning | Address root | Over-complicate simple |

---

## Q4: Am I using the wrong one for this situation?

[VOI: HIGH - frame mismatch = wrong approach entirely]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong level (system vs individual) | HIGH | Level mismatch | Change level | Keep solving wrong level |
| Wrong domain (technical vs human) | HIGH | Domain mismatch | Switch domains | Apply wrong lens |
| Wrong mode (validation vs exploration) | HIGH | Mode mismatch | Switch modes | Apply wrong mode |
| Frame is appropriate | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Miss that frame wrong |

## Q5: Am I using a literal or metaphorical interpretation?

[VOI: MED - affects interpretation but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown | MED | Haven't determined | Check first | Respond to wrong level |
| Literal | MED | Take at face value | Direct response | Miss metaphor |
| Metaphorical | MED | Look for symbolism | Interpret deeper | Over-interpret |
| Mixed | LOW | Some of each | Handle both | Conflate levels |

---

## Q6: Am I using a completeness or quality frame?

[VOI: MED - affects focus but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Neither explicit | MED | Frame unclear | Define frame | Work without direction |
| Completeness | MED | Fill all gaps | Comprehensive | Miss quality issues |
| Quality | MED | Improve existing | Polish | Miss gaps |
| Both equally | LOW | Balanced | Parallel progress | Neither fully addressed |

---

## Q7: Am I using a system or individual frame?

[VOI: MED - affects scope but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Individual focus | MED | Person-level | Personal solution | Miss systemic issues |
| System focus | MED | Structure-level | Systemic solution | Miss individual needs |
| Both | LOW | Multi-level | Complete picture | May be too complex |

---

## Q8: Am I using a best-case or worst-case frame?

[VOI: MED - affects risk stance but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown | MED | Haven't checked | Examine valence | Unexamined bias |
| Best-case | MED | Optimistic read | Opportunity focus | Miss risks |
| Worst-case | MED | Pessimistic read | Risk focus | Miss opportunities |
| Balanced | LOW | Both considered | Comprehensive | May still be skewed |

---

## Q9: Am I using a problem or opportunity frame?

[VOI: LOW - affects tone but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Problem (fix what's broken) | LOW | Remedial | Fix issues | Miss growth potential |
| Opportunity (build what's possible) | LOW | Aspirational | Create value | Ignore current problems |
| Both | LOW | Complete | Address all | May be too broad |
| Neither (maintenance) | LOW | Status quo | Preserve | Miss need for change |

---

## Q10: Am I using a present or future frame?

[VOI: LOW - affects timing but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Present | LOW | Current state | Address now | Miss future implications |
| Future | LOW | Future state | Plan ahead | Ignore present constraints |
| Past | LOW | Historical | Learn from past | Stuck in past |
| Timeless | LOW | Always true | Generalizable | May not apply to specifics |

---

## Q11: Am I using an insider or outsider frame?

[VOI: LOW - affects perspective but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown | LOW | Haven't determined | Identify position | Assume wrong position |
| Insider | LOW | Deep knowledge | Nuanced | Miss outside perspective |
| Outsider | LOW | Fresh eyes | Novel insights | Miss context |
| Both | LOW | Complete | Multiple views | May be inconsistent |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Speaker's intended frame? - misalignment = wrong problem
2. Q2: My frame or theirs? - whose frame determines direction
3. Q3: Surface or deep? - wrong depth = miss issue
4. Q4: Wrong frame for situation? - mismatch = wrong approach

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Literal or metaphorical? - interpretation level
6. Q6: Completeness or quality? - focus
7. Q7: System or individual? - scope
8. Q8: Best-case or worst-case? - risk stance

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Problem or opportunity? - tone
10. Q10: Present or future? - timing
11. Q11: Insider or outsider? - perspective flavor

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ interpretive depth. VOI = action divergence.**

"Am I using an insider or outsider frame?" sounds sophisticated but has LOW VOI - you do similar analysis either way.

"Am I using the frame the speaker intended?" has HIGH VOI - misaligned frames mean solving the wrong problem entirely.

## Usage Note

This category expands on 89_framing.md with specific frame types. Should be invoked early in any analysis to ensure the interpretation frame is explicit and appropriate.

→ Pairs with: 89_framing.md (general framing)
→ Pairs with: 90_meta_level.md (level of analysis)
→ Pairs with: 91_assumptions.md (hidden frame assumptions)
