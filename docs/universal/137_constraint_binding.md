## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Which constraint is actually binding?

[VOI: HIGH - attacking non-binding constraint is wasted effort]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |

| Attacking binding constraint | LOW | Effort well-placed | Continue | Actually non-binding |

## Q2: Is the perceived constraint actually a constraint?

[VOI: HIGH - false constraints limit unnecessarily]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Constraint is imaginary | HIGH | Self-imposed limitation | Remove false constraint | Limited by fiction |
| Unknown if real | MED | May be imaginary | Constraint verification | Either fictional or real |
| Constraint is real | LOW | Must work within | Accept constraint | Think real when imaginary |

---

## Q3: How tight is the binding constraint?

[VOI: HIGH - very tight = small improvements matter; loose = need not optimize]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Extremely tight | HIGH | Every bit matters | Maximize constraint efficiency | Miss that small gains matter |
| Moderate tightness | MED | Some slack available | Balance efforts | Over or under optimize |
| Very loose | HIGH | Not actually limiting | Find real bottleneck | Optimize the irrelevant |
| Unknown tightness | MED | May misallocate | Tightness measurement | Either over or under focus |

## Q4: Will the binding constraint shift if we improve?

[VOI: HIGH - new bottleneck appears after fixing current]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will shift to new constraint | HIGH | Prepare for next | Identify next bottleneck | Surprised by new limit |
| Unknown if shifts | MED | May be surprised | Shift analysis | Either prepared or surprised |
| Will remain binding | LOW | Same constraint | Focus all effort there | Shifts without preparation |

---

## Q5: Are there multiple binding constraints?

[VOI: HIGH - multiple binding = must address all]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Multiple binding | HIGH | Must address all | Multi-constraint optimization | Fix one, still stuck |
| Unknown count | MED | May have multiple | Constraint counting | Either miss some or paranoid |
| Single binding | LOW | Focus on one | Concentrate effort | Actually multiple |

---

## Q6: Can we relax the binding constraint?

[VOI: MED - affects approach but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can relax but haven't tried | MED | Opportunity missed | Attempt relaxation | Accept when can change |
| Unknown if relaxable | MED | May be changeable | Relaxation analysis | Either change or accept |
| Cannot relax | LOW | Must work within | Accept and optimize | Think fixed when movable |

---

## Q7: Is the constraint internal or external?

[VOI: MED - affects agency but similar optimization]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Internal (we control) | MED | Can change ourselves | Change internal | Blame external |
| External (we don't control) | MED | Must adapt | Adapt to external | Try to change unchangeable |
| Unknown locus | MED | May be fighting wrong battle | Locus analysis | Either futile change or missed opportunity |

---

## Q8: What's the cost of the binding constraint?

[VOI: MED - affects prioritization]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Very high cost | MED | Worth major investment | Invest heavily | Underinvest |
| Moderate cost | LOW | Normal investment | Standard effort | Over or under invest |
| Low cost | MED | Minor optimization | Low priority | Over-prioritize |
| Unknown cost | MED | May misprioritize | Cost analysis | Either over or under prioritize |

---

## Q9: Is there slack being wasted in non-binding constraints?

[VOI: LOW - efficiency but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Slack being wasted | LOW | Reallocation possible | Reallocate resources | Waste slack |
| Unknown slack | LOW | May be wasting | Slack analysis | Either waste or efficient |
| Slack efficiently used | LOW | Resources well-placed | Continue | Actually wasted |

---

## Q10: Are constraints interacting?

[VOI: LOW - affects modeling but similar optimization]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Constraints interact | LOW | Coupled optimization | Model interactions | Miss coupling effects |
| Unknown interaction | LOW | May have coupling | Interaction analysis | Either coupled or independent |
| Constraints independent | LOW | Separate optimization | Optimize separately | Miss interaction |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Which constraint binds? - effort allocation
2. Q2: Constraint real? - false limitations
3. Q3: How tight? - optimization intensity
4. Q4: Will it shift? - next bottleneck
5. Q5: Multiple binding? - multi-front optimization

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Can relax? - constraint changeability
7. Q7: Internal or external? - agency locus
8. Q8: Cost of constraint? - investment priority

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Slack wasted? - efficiency
10. Q10: Constraints interact? - coupling

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ optimization sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are constraints interacting?" is analytically interesting but has LOW VOI - you model carefully either way.

"Which constraint is actually binding?" has HIGH VOI - optimizing non-binding constraints is pure waste.

## The Theory of Constraints

Eli Goldratt's insight: A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Strengthening non-weakest links does nothing.

**The Process:**
1. Identify the binding constraint
2. Exploit the constraint (maximize its output)
3. Subordinate everything else to the constraint
4. Elevate the constraint (increase its capacity)
5. Go back to step 1 (new bottleneck emerges)

**The trap:** Optimizing everywhere equally. This feels productive but ignores that only the bottleneck matters.

**The move:** Ruthlessly identify what's actually limiting. Put all marginal effort there. Everything else is slack.
