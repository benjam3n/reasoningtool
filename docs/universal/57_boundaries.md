## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are boundaries defined for this goal?
[VOI: HIGH - Vague/not defined means scope creep risk, clarify vs work within]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Vaguely defined | HIGH | Clarify first vs proceed | Clarify | Clear |
| Not defined | HIGH | Define boundaries vs proceed | Define boundaries | Defined |
| Unknown if defined | MED | Boundary audit vs assume | Boundary audit | Definition known |
| Yes, clearly defined | LOW | Clear scope either way | Work within | Unclear |

---

## Q2: Are there disputes about boundaries?
[VOI: HIGH - Major disputes means conflict, resolve before proceed vs proceed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Major disputes | HIGH | Resolve before proceed vs proceed | Resolve before proceed | Minor |
| Unknown if disputes | MED | Dispute check vs assume | Dispute check | Disputes known |
| Minor disputes | MED | Resolve vs ignore | Resolve | Different level |
| No disputes | LOW | Aligned either way | Proceed | Disputes exist |

---

## Q3: Are there interfaces where goal connects to things outside boundary?
[VOI: HIGH - Poorly-defined interfaces means integration risk, define vs maintain]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, poorly-defined | HIGH | Define interfaces vs proceed | Define interfaces | Well-defined |
| Unknown interfaces | MED | Interface discovery vs assume | Interface discovery | Interfaces known |
| Yes, well-defined interfaces | LOW | Clear connections either way | Maintain | Poorly defined |
| No interfaces | LOW | Self-contained either way | Proceed | Interfaces exist |

---

## Q4: Are there problems at interfaces?
[VOI: HIGH - Major problems means integration failure, fix urgently vs maintain]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Major problems | HIGH | Fix urgently vs maintain | Fix urgently | Minor |
| Unknown if problems | MED | Interface audit vs assume | Interface audit | Problems known |
| Minor problems | MED | Address vs ignore | Address | Different level |
| No problems | LOW | Smooth connection either way | Maintain | Problems exist |

---

## Q5: What is included in scope?
[VOI: HIGH - Not specified means scope unknown, specify vs work on included]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not specified | HIGH | Specify inclusions vs proceed | Specify inclusions | Specified |
| Unknown | MED | Inclusion review vs assume | Inclusion review | Inclusions known |
| Partially specified | MED | Clarify edges vs proceed | Clarify edges | Different clarity |
| Clearly specified | LOW | Can focus either way | Work on included | Unclear |

---

## Q6: What is excluded from scope?
[VOI: HIGH - Not specified means may overwork, specify vs respect limits]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not specified | HIGH | Specify exclusions vs proceed | Specify exclusions | Specified |
| Unknown | MED | Exclusion review vs assume | Exclusion review | Exclusions known |
| Partially specified | MED | Clarify edges vs proceed | Clarify edges | Different clarity |
| Clearly specified | LOW | Clear limits either way | Respect limits | Unclear |

---

## Q7: Are boundaries communicated to all relevant parties?
[VOI: HIGH - Few informed means misalignment risk, communicate vs maintain]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Few informed | HIGH | Communicate widely vs maintain | Communicate widely | More informed |
| Unknown coverage | MED | Communication audit vs assume | Communication audit | Coverage known |
| Most informed | MED | Inform rest vs maintain | Inform rest | Different coverage |
| Yes, all informed | LOW | Aligned either way | Maintain | Not all |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Defined? (Vague/not → clarify vs proceed)
2. Q2: Disputes? (Major → resolve vs proceed)
3. Q3: Interfaces? (Poorly-defined → define vs proceed)
4. Q4: Interface problems? (Major → fix urgently vs maintain)
5. Q5: Inclusions? (Not specified → specify vs proceed)
6. Q6: Exclusions? (Not specified → specify vs proceed)
7. Q7: Communicated? (Few → communicate vs maintain)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
(All questions have HIGH entries, order by scope impact)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Boundary Clarity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI boundary question is one where the answer determines whether you DEFINE/CLARIFY or PROCEED. "Vaguely defined boundaries" routes you to "clarify first" - a completely different action than "work within clear boundaries."

A LOW VOI boundary question like "clearly specified inclusions vs not" doesn't change your fundamental approach when clear - you'll work on the goal either way, just with different focus certainty.
