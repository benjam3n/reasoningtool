**Category**: META - Foundational Beliefs Underlying Everything
**Source**: Hidden assumptions determine everything else
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: What are we assuming without stating?

[VOI: HIGH - hidden assumptions can invalidate everything]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Important assumptions hidden | HIGH | Surface them first | Assumption audit | Blindsided when wrong |
| Unknown assumptions | HIGH | Can't validate | Discovery process | Operating on false beliefs |
| Assumptions surfaced | LOW | Can examine | Test them | Miss important ones |

---

## Q2: What must be true for our approach to make sense?

[VOI: HIGH - invalid preconditions = approach fails from start]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Some preconditions not met | HIGH | Approach compromised | Address preconditions | Execute into failure |
| Preconditions unknown | MED | May be invalid | Precondition mapping | Unknowingly compromised |
| Preconditions met | LOW | Approach valid | Execute | Approach invalid from start |

---

## Q3: Are we assuming reversibility where there isn't any?

[VOI: HIGH - irreversible decisions need completely different care level]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Actually irreversible | HIGH | High stakes, extra care | Thorough analysis | Casual decision becomes permanent |
| Unknown reversibility | MED | May be permanent | Reversibility check | Surprised by permanence |
| Truly reversible | LOW | Low stakes | Proceed freely | Stuck with regretted choice |

---

## Q4: What are we taking as given that could be changed?

[VOI: HIGH - false constraints artificially limit solutions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| False constraints accepted | HIGH | Artificially limited | Challenge constraints | Unnecessarily constrained |
| Unknown which changeable | MED | May be over-constrained | Constraint testing | Unnecessary limitations |
| True constraints identified | LOW | Working within real limits | Accept | Miss changeable constraints |

---

## Q5: Are we assuming good faith where there isn't any?

[VOI: HIGH - naivety leads to exploitation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Bad faith present | HIGH | Trust will be exploited | Protect yourself | Naive trust, get burned |
| Mixed motives | MED | Partial trust | Verify | Over or under trust |
| Unknown faith | MED | Vulnerability unknown | Faith assessment | Either exploited or miss ally |
| Good faith justified | LOW | Trust appropriate | Trust | Get exploited |

---

## Q6: Are we assuming this is typical when it might be exceptional?

[VOI: HIGH - exceptional cases need completely different handling]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Exceptional case | HIGH | Needs special handling | Treat as exception | Standard treatment harms |
| Unknown typicality | MED | May mishandle | Typicality check | Wrong approach |
| Typical case | LOW | Standard approach | Use standard | Standard fails |

---

## Q7: Are we assuming continuity where there might be discontinuity?

[VOI: HIGH - extrapolation fails at discontinuities]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Discontinuity coming | HIGH | Extrapolation fails | Plan for break | Extrapolate into cliff |
| Unknown if continuous | MED | May be surprised | Discontinuity scan | Either overreact or blindsided |
| Continuity valid | LOW | Extrapolation works | Extrapolate | Blindsided by discontinuity |

---

## Q8: What worldview underlies our approach?

[VOI: MED - affects framing but often similar actions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Worldview inappropriate | HIGH | Mismatches reality | Change worldview | Act on wrong reality model |
| Worldview unexamined | MED | May mismatch | Worldview surfacing | Unknowingly wrong model |
| Worldview appropriate | LOW | Matches reality | Proceed | Wrong model of reality |

---

## Q9: What sacred cows are we not questioning?

[VOI: MED - affects depth of analysis but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sacred cows hidden | MED | Can't question what we can't see | Surface and evaluate | Protected false beliefs |
| Sacred cows identified | MED | Know what's protected | Deliberate about protection | Protected wrong things |
| Unknown if sacred cows | MED | May have hidden | Sacred cow hunt | Unknowingly protecting falsehoods |
| No sacred cows | LOW | All questionable | Question freely | Actually have untouchables |

---

## Q10: Are we assuming rationality where there isn't any?

[VOI: MED - affects prediction method but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Actors are irrational | MED | Need different approach | Model psychology | Get manipulated |
| Mixed rationality | MED | Partial prediction | Combine approaches | Over-rely on one model |
| Unknown rationality | MED | Model may fail | Rationality testing | Wrong predictions |
| Actors are rational | LOW | Predictable via incentives | Use rational model | Model fails |

---

## Q11: What are we assuming about human nature?

[VOI: LOW - affects framing but similar interventions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Assumption wrong direction | MED | Counter-productive | Reassess | Make things worse |
| People more capable than assumed | LOW | Underutilizing | Raise expectations | Overwhelm |
| People less capable than assumed | LOW | Overloading | Lower expectations | Underutilize |
| Assumption matches reality | LOW | Interventions work | Proceed | Interventions backfire |
| Unknown accuracy | LOW | May mismatch | Assumption testing | Wrong interventions |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: What are we assuming? - foundation
2. Q2: Preconditions for approach? - validity
3. Q3: Assuming reversibility? - stakes level
4. Q4: False constraints? - artificially limited
5. Q5: Good faith where there isn't? - exploitation risk
6. Q6: Typical when exceptional? - handling mode
7. Q7: Continuity when discontinuity? - extrapolation validity

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
8. Q8: Worldview appropriate? - reality model
9. Q9: Sacred cows? - hidden protections
10. Q10: Assuming rationality? - prediction model

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
11. Q11: Human nature assumptions? - framing

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth. VOI = action divergence.**

"What are we assuming about human nature?" feels profound but has LOW VOI - similar interventions regardless.

"Are we assuming reversibility where there isn't any?" has HIGH VOI - irreversible decisions require completely different process.
