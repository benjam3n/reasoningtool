## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**The analytical mind (Head) can block influence. Sometimes you go through it; sometimes you bypass it.**

**Frontal approach**: Direct statements, explicit logic, evidence
- "You should do X because Y"
- Triggers analytical evaluation
- Works when logic supports your case
- Fails when emotion/identity is involved

**Bypass approach**: Metaphors, stories, quotes, sensory description
- "My friend said..." / "It's like..." / "There once was..."
- Goes to Gut without triggering Head
- Works when logic would fail
- Creates experience rather than argument

**Key insight**: Metaphors are sensory-concrete, so they bypass abstract analytical processing. Stories create safety through distance. Quotes provide deniability.

## Q1: Is the analytical filter helping or blocking us?

[VOI: HIGH - determines entire approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Filter is blocking us | HIGH | Need bypass | Use metaphor/story/quote | Direct fails, resistance |
| Unknown filter status | MED | May be blocked | Filter diagnosis | Either frontal or bypass |
| Filter is open/neutral | LOW | Frontal works | Direct approach | Bypass when unnecessary |
| Filter is helping us | LOW | Use it | Logical argument | Bypass helpful filter |

---

## Q2: Is this an identity/values issue?

[VOI: HIGH - identity issues resist frontal assault]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Identity involved | HIGH | Frontal creates backlash | Bypass only | Argue against identity = fail |
| Unknown if identity | MED | May trigger backlash | Identity check | Either frontal or bypass |
| Not identity issue | LOW | Frontal safe | Direct approach | Actually identity involved |

---

## Q3: Does the receiver want to be influenced?

[VOI: HIGH - unwilling = bypass, willing = frontal]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Resistant to influence | HIGH | Must bypass | Indirect methods | Direct blocked |
| Unknown willingness | MED | May be resistant | Willingness test | Either approach |
| Willing to be influenced | LOW | Frontal works | Direct approach | Actually resistant |

---

## Q4: Is deniability needed?

[VOI: MED - deniability enables message delivery in sensitive cases]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Deniability needed | MED | Use quotes/stories | "My friend said..." | Explicit rejected |
| Unknown if needed | MED | May need cover | Deniability check | Either explicit or implied |
| Deniability not needed | LOW | Direct okay | State explicitly | Unnecessary indirection |

---

## Q5: What's the right bypass method?

[VOI: MED - different methods work in different contexts]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need metaphor (X = Y) | MED | Sensory substitution | Static metaphor | Wrong bypass method |
| Need story (narrative) | MED | Character identification | Tell story | Wrong bypass method |
| Need quote (third party) | MED | Deniability | "She said..." | Wrong bypass method |
| Unknown which method | MED | May be ineffective | Method testing | Wrong method selected |

---

## Q6: How much safety does receiver need?

[VOI: MED - more safety = more indirection]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High safety needed | MED | Deep indirection | Multiple story layers | Too direct, threat response |
| Moderate safety | LOW | Some indirection | Light metaphor | Either too direct or indirect |
| Low safety needed | LOW | Direct okay | Minimal framing | Unnecessary indirection |

---

## Q7: Can we embed the message?

[VOI: MED - embedding hides message from analytical filter]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can embed but not doing | MED | Missed cover | Embed in story/quote | Explicit caught by filter |
| Unknown if can embed | MED | May be possible | Embedding test | Either embed or not |
| Cannot embed | LOW | Direct only | Best available framing | Miss embedding option |

---

## Q8: Is the metaphor/story well-matched?

[VOI: LOW - affects quality but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Poorly matched | LOW | Weak transfer | Improve match | Weak connection |
| Unknown match quality | LOW | May be weak | Match check | Either strong or weak |
| Well matched | LOW | Strong transfer | Continue | Actually poorly matched |

---

## Q9: Is there pattern clarity?

[VOI: LOW - affects resonance but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Pattern unclear | LOW | May be missed | Clarify pattern | Metaphor missed |
| Unknown clarity | LOW | May be unclear | Clarity check | Either clear or not |
| Pattern clear | LOW | Will transfer | Continue | Actually unclear |

---

## Q10: Is the bypass being noticed?

[VOI: LOW - noticed bypass may fail but not always]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Bypass noticed | LOW | May create resistance | Adjust or continue | Some resistance |
| Unknown if noticed | LOW | May be transparent | Notice check | Either noticed or not |
| Bypass invisible | LOW | Clean transfer | Continue | Actually noticed |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Filter helping or blocking? - approach selection
2. Q2: Identity involved? - backlash risk
3. Q3: Willing to be influenced? - resistance

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
4. Q4: Deniability needed? - cover
5. Q5: Which bypass method? - technique
6. Q6: Safety needed? - indirection level
7. Q7: Can embed message? - hiding

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Metaphor well-matched? - quality
9. Q9: Pattern clarity? - resonance
10. Q10: Bypass noticed? - transparency

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ rhetorical sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the metaphor well-matched?" is a craft question with LOW VOI - you improve quality either way.

"Is the analytical filter helping or blocking us?" has HIGH VOI - determines whether frontal or bypass approach.

## The Bypass Toolkit

**Static Metaphor (X = Y)**:
- "Getting this done is gonna be like tearing into the juiciest steak"
- Concrete sensory → immediate Gut impact
- Abstract → must be decoded by Head first

**Narrative Metaphor (Story)**:
- Character makes decision, has experience
- Receiver identifies with character
- Learns pattern without explicit instruction
- Safety: "It's about someone else, not you"

**Quote (Third Party)**:
- "My friend Frank told his daughter..."
- Message delivered without taking responsibility
- Even more deniability: "Her sister told me that Frank said..."
- Nested quotes = deeper embedding

**Proof by Enjoyable Analogy (P.E.A.)**:
- When you X, it's like Y, which leads to Z
- X = any starting point
- Y = enjoyable bridge imagery
- Z = meaning you want to assign
- Arbitrary connection feels logical

## When to Bypass vs Frontal

| Condition | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Logic supports you, receiver is open | Frontal |
| Logic against you, receiver resistant | Bypass |
| Identity/values involved | Bypass |
| Emotion is the issue, not facts | Bypass |
| Need deniability | Bypass (quotes/stories) |
| Want experience, not understanding | Bypass |
| Receiver is analytical and willing | Frontal |

**The trap:** Using frontal approach when identity is involved. Creates backlash, strengthens resistance.

**The move:** Before attempting to influence, check: Is the analytical filter friend or foe? If foe, bypass it with metaphor, story, or quote.
