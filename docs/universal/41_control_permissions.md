## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach

## Q5: What factors are under others' control?
[VOI: HIGH - Critical external dependencies require influence strategy vs independent action]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Critical factors by others | HIGH | Influence strategy vs independent | Influence or reduce | Less critical |
| Unknown others' control | MED | Map dependencies vs assume | Control mapping | Control known |

| No factors by others | LOW | Independent execution either way | Independent execution | Some by others |

---

## Q6: How can I influence others' decisions on controlled factors?
[VOI: HIGH - No influence means accept/change goal vs use influence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No influence | HIGH | Accept or change goal vs engage | Accept or change goal | Influence exists |
| Unknown influence path | MED | Discover path vs use known | Influence discovery | Path known |
| Direct influence possible | MED | Engage directly vs indirectly | Use influence | Less influence |
| Indirect influence only | MED | Work through others vs direct | Work through others | Direct possible |

---

## Q7: What is the process for obtaining each permission?
[VOI: HIGH - No clear process means create path vs follow existing]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |

| No clear process | HIGH | Create path vs follow process | Create path | Process exists |
| Unknown process | MED | Research first vs act | Process discovery | Process known |
| Formal process exists | MED | Follow bureaucracy vs relationships | Follow process | No formal process |
| Informal process | MED | Build relationships vs formal | Work relationships | Formal process |

---

## Q8: How long does obtaining permission typically take?
[VOI: HIGH - Long duration requires early start or goal change vs proceed normally]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Long (months) | HIGH | Start early or change approach | Start early or change | Actually faster |
| Unknown duration | MED | Research first vs assume | Duration research | Duration known |
| Moderate (weeks) | MED | Factor into timeline vs quick | Factor into timeline | Different duration |
| Quick (days) | LOW | Proceed soon either way | Proceed soon | Takes longer |

---

## Q9: What permissions are required to achieve this goal?
[VOI: MED - Unknown permissions require analysis vs proceed with known list]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown what's needed | MED | Permission analysis first vs proceed | Permission analysis | Permissions known |
| Permissions identified | LOW | Plan acquisition either way | Acquire permissions | Missing permissions |
| No permissions needed | LOW | Proceed freely either way | Proceed freely | Permissions needed |

---

## Q10: What would obtaining each permission require?
[VOI: MED - Significant effort changes priority vs simple request]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown requirements | MED | Research first vs act | Requirement discovery | Requirements known |
| Significant effort | MED | Evaluate worth vs just do | Evaluate if worth | Less effort |
| Formal process | MED | Follow bureaucracy vs ask | Follow process | Simpler |
| Relationship required | MED | Build relationship first vs request | Build relationship | No relationship |
| Simple request | LOW | Just ask either way | Just ask | More complex |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Who can grant? (Unknown/No one → different acquisition strategy)
2. Q2: Have permissions? (Few/None → acquisition vs proceed)
3. Q3: Incentives? (Opposed → conflict resolution vs cooperation)
4. Q4: Factors controlled? (Few → maximize limited vs broad action)
5. Q5: Others' control? (Critical → influence strategy vs independent)
6. Q6: Influence possible? (No → accept/change vs engage)
7. Q7: Process exists? (No → create vs follow)
8. Q8: How long? (Months → early start vs normal)

**MED VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
9. Q9: Permissions needed? (Unknown → analyze first)
10. Q10: What required? (Significant → evaluate priority)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI question is one where different answers lead to completely different action paths. Knowing "who can grant permission" routes you to either "approach this person" or "change your entire approach" - completely different paths.

A LOW VOI question like "permissions identified vs not" leads to roughly the same action either way - you'll need to work on permissions regardless, just with slightly different framing.
