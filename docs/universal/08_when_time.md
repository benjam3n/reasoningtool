## Q8: What sequence/ordering matters?
[VOI: MED - dependencies matter, same goal]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Precision level) - immediate changes everything
2. **Q4** (Urgency) - crisis vs normal
3. **Q2** (Fixed vs flexible) - constraints
4. **Q6** (Consequences of miss) - stakes
5. **Q3** (What drives timeline) - dependencies
6. **Q5** (Windows) - timing constraints
7. **Q7** (Duration) - scope understanding
8. **Q8-Q11** (Sequence, date, sunk time, rhythm) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is this immediate?" routes to crisis response vs planning. "Is the deadline hard?" routes to scope flexibility vs time flexibility.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
