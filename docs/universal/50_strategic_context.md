---

## Q8: Is cooperation possible?
[VOI: MED - Determines approach but both lead to goal pursuit]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown | MED | Cooperation analysis vs assume | Cooperation analysis | Possibility known |
| Possibly | MED | Test cooperation vs assume | Test cooperation | Clear answer |
| No, not possible | MED | Compete or avoid vs cooperate | Accept competition | Possible |
| Yes, clearly possible | LOW | Pursue cooperation either way | Seek cooperation | Not possible |

---

## Q9: Are there precedents for this goal?
[VOI: MED - Precedents inform approach but don't change direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Actors? (Significant/unknown → strategic consideration vs alone)
2. Q2: Alignment? (Opposed/unknown → strategic planning vs cooperate)
3. Q3: Zero-sum? (Yes/unknown → competition vs cooperation)
4. Q4: Designed for? (Different conditions → adapt vs execute)
5. Q5: Conditions present? (Absent/unknown → major adaptation vs execute)
6. Q6: Analogy quality? (Poor → change frame vs use)
7. Q7: Analogy gaps? (Major/unknown → adjust vs use)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
8. Q8: Cooperation possible? (Approach, not direction)
9. Q9: Precedents? (Informs, not changes)
10. Q10: Lessons? (Details, not direction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Strategic Importance**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI strategic context question is one where the answer determines whether you COMPETE or COOPERATE, or whether you ADAPT THE PLAN or EXECUTE AS-IS. "Zero-sum game" routes you to "compete strategically" - a fundamentally different approach than "seek cooperation."

A LOW VOI strategic context question like "clear lessons from precedents" doesn't change your fundamental approach - you'll pursue the goal either way, just with more or less learning from past examples.
