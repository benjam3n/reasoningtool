## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Loss events? (High-probability → protect vs proceed)
2. Q2: Detection? (Late/None → create system vs monitor)
3. Q3: New risks? (Significant → risk planning vs enjoy)
4. Q4: Maintenance burden? (Heavy → evaluate viability vs proceed)
5. Q5: Resources consumed? (Many → evaluate viability vs proceed)
6. Q6: Ongoing cost? (High → sustainability check vs proceed)
7. Q7: Skills decay? (Critical → maintain practice vs no action)
8. Q8: Info outdated? (Rapidly → update system vs use as-is)
9. Q9: Relationships decay? (Critical → regular contact vs no action)
10. Q10: Assets depreciate? (Rapid → replace/protect vs maintain)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
11. Q11: New goals? (Refinement, not direction change)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Long-term Importance**

VOI = Action Divergence

Sustainability questions often feel "future-focused" and less urgent. But HIGH VOI sustainability questions change TODAY's actions: "heavy maintenance required" might make you abandon the goal NOW, not just worry about it later.

LOW VOI sustainability questions like "what new goals become achievable" don't change your current actions much - you'll pursue the goal either way and explore later.
