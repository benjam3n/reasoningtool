## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Small changes would shift | HIGH | Sensitive choice | Careful analysis | Robust |
| Nothing would change | MED | Robust choice | Proceed confidently | Actually sensitive |
| Unknown sensitivity | MED | Sensitivity analysis | Test sensitivity | Sensitivity known |
| Major changes needed to shift | LOW | Fairly robust | Proceed with monitoring | More sensitive |

---

## Q6: What constraints eliminate options?
[VOI: HIGH - most eliminated = few remaining, verify constraints real]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Most eliminated | HIGH | Few remaining | Verify constraints are real | More viable |
| Some eliminated by constraints | MED | Narrower set | Focus on viable | More or fewer viable |
| Unknown what's eliminated | MED | Constraint analysis | Viability check | Elimination known |
| No constraints eliminate | LOW | All viable | Evaluate all | Constraints exist |

---

## Q7: What new options could be created?
[VOI: HIGH - new options worth exploring = better may exist]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| New options worth exploring | HIGH | Better options may exist | Explore before deciding | Existing are sufficient |
| New options possible | MED | Worth creating | Generate new | No new possible |
| No new options possible | MED | Work with existing | Evaluate existing | New options possible |
| Unknown if new possible | MED | Exploration worthwhile | Option creation | Creation potential known |

---

## Q8: What are the key differentiators?
[VOI: HIGH - risk differentiates = risk-driven decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Risk differentiates | HIGH | Risk-driven | Compare risks | Risk not key |
| Cost differentiates | MED | Budget-driven | Compare costs | Cost not key |
| Time differentiates | MED | Timeline-driven | Compare timelines | Time not key |
| Quality differentiates | MED | Quality-driven | Compare quality | Quality not key |
| Unknown differentiators | MED | Discovery needed | Differentiator discovery | Differentiators known |
| Multiple differentiators | LOW | Multi-criteria | Weight criteria | Single differentiator |

---

## Q9: Are options mutually exclusive?
[VOI: MED - hybrid possible vs must choose]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, mutually exclusive | MED | Pick one only | Choose one | Can combine |
| No, can combine | MED | Hybrid possible | Consider combinations | Must choose one |
| Unknown exclusivity | MED | Analysis needed | Exclusivity analysis | Exclusivity known |
| Some combinable | LOW | Partial flexibility | Identify combinations | All or none combinable |

---

## Q10: What option is currently favored?
[VOI: LOW - validation, same decision process]

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (How many?) - sufficient options exist?
2. **Q2** (All known?) - complete set?
3. **Q4** (Quality spread) - can we evaluate?
4. **Q6** (Constraints) - what's actually viable?
5. **Q7** (New options) - should we create more?
6. **Q3** (Generation method) - systematic?
7. **Q5** (Sensitivity) - robust choice?
8. **Q8** (Differentiators) - risk-driven?
9. **Q9-Q10** (Exclusivity, favorite) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Are there zero options?" routes to option generation vs option evaluation. "Are more options missing?" routes to search vs decide.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
