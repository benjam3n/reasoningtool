## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are we solving the right problem at the right level?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong level = entire effort wasted]

## Q4: Should we be working on the system or in the system?

## Q5: Are we being strategic or tactical?

| Appropriately strategic | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Miss that orientation wrong |
| Appropriately tactical | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Miss that orientation wrong |

## Q6: Are we optimizing locally or globally?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong scope = my team wins, company loses]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too local | HIGH | Widen scope | Global consideration | Local wins, global loses |
| Too global | MED | Narrow scope | Local attention | Big picture at cost of parts |
| Appropriate scope | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Optimize wrong scope |
| Unknown scope | MED | Must determine | Scope check | Wrong optimization scope |

---

## Q7: Have we collapsed multiple questions into one?

[VOI: HIGH - bundled questions = confused answers]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Multiple questions bundled | HIGH | Unbundle first | Separate questions | Answer mismatch reality |
| Single clear question | LOW | Can answer directly | Answer | Actually bundled |
| Unknown if bundled | MED | Need to check | Bundle check | Answer wrong question |

---

## Q8: Are we following rules or purpose?

[VOI: MED - same general work, different guidance source]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Rules diverged from purpose | HIGH | Follow purpose | Purpose-driven action | Follow rules, miss purpose |
| Rules serve purpose | LOW | Follow rules | Aligned action | Actually purpose diverged |
| No rules, just purpose | MED | Create guidelines | Structure | Chaos without structure |
| Unknown if diverged | MED | Need to check | Rule-purpose check | Blindly follow or ignore |

---

## Q9: Are we questioning the right things?

[VOI: MED - affects depth but not direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Under-questioning | MED | Question more | Add scrutiny | Act on false assumptions |
| Over-questioning | MED | Accept some givens | Proceed faster | Paralysis |
| Questioning right things | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Wasting doubt or missing critical |
| Unknown if right | MED | Need audit | Question audit | Either paralyzed or blind |

---

## Q10: Are we holding our views or being held by them?

[VOI: MED - affects objectivity but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Captured by views | MED | Detach and evaluate | Fresh assessment | Defend views regardless |
| Holding views appropriately | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Actually captured |
| Unknown relationship | MED | Need to examine | View-holding check | Captured without knowing |

---

## Q11: Is this analysis or meta-analysis needed?

[VOI: LOW - framing, not fundamentally different action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Meta-analysis as avoidance | MED | Stop and act | Object-level work | Analyze forever |
| Meta-level work needed | LOW | Continue analyzing | Analyze | Act without thinking |
| Object-level work needed | LOW | Stop analyzing | Act | Miss meta issues |
| Unknown which | LOW | Default to balance | Both | Either overthink or underthink |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Right level? - wrong level wastes everything
2. Q2: Content or process? - wrong diagnosis = chronic failure
3. Q3: Right things? - efficiency at wrong thing = useless
4. Q4: On or in system? - chronic firefighting vs root cause
5. Q5: Strategic or tactical? - win battles, lose war
6. Q6: Local or global? - optimize wrong scope
7. Q7: Bundled questions? - confused answers

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
8. Q8: Rules or purpose? - when diverged
9. Q9: Questioning right things? - depth calibration
10. Q10: Holding or held by views? - objectivity

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
11. Q11: Analysis needed? - framing

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical importance. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are we holding our views or being held by them?" is profound but has MED VOI - it doesn't radically change what you do next.

"Are we doing the right things or doing things right?" has HIGH VOI - doing wrong things means completely changing direction.
