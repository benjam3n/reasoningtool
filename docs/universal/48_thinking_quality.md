## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Unverified assumptions? (Many/unknown → verify vs proceed)
2. Q2: Biases? (Likely/unknown → outside view vs proceed)
3. Q3: Causation evidence? (Correlation → verify vs trust)
4. Q4: Model fit? (Poor/unknown → change vs use)
5. Q5: Prediction track record? (Weak/none → discount vs trust)
6. Q6: Wrong prediction cost? (High → verify/hedge vs act)
7. Q7: False assumption cost? (High → verify vs proceed)
8. Q8: Mental model? (None → apply vs unstructured)
9. Q9: Consistency? (Major contradictions → revise vs execute)
10. Q10: Complexity justified? (Much unjustified → simplify vs proceed)
11. Q11: Causal belief? (None → find link vs proceed)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
12. Q12: Intermediate steps? (Verification detail, not direction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Thinking Rigor**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI thinking quality question is one where the answer determines whether you TRUST YOUR REASONING or STOP AND VERIFY. "Biases likely present" routes you to "seek outside view" - a completely different action than "proceed with confidence."

A LOW VOI thinking quality question like "direct vs indirect causation" doesn't change your basic approach - you'll act on the plan either way, just with more or less intermediate verification.
