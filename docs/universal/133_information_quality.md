**Category**: META - Can We Trust the Inputs?
**Source**: Epistemology, source criticism, data quality, scientific method
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is the information reliable?

[VOI: HIGH - unreliable information = unreliable conclusions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Information unreliable | HIGH | Conclusions invalid | Find better sources | Build on sand |
| Unknown reliability | MED | May be building on sand | Reliability check | Either sand or solid |
| Information reliable | LOW | Can trust | Use information | Actually unreliable |

---

## Q2: What is the provenance of this information?

[VOI: HIGH - unknown source = unknown bias and accuracy]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Provenance unknown | HIGH | Can't assess quality | Trace provenance | Trust untraceable |
| Provenance questionable | MED | Quality uncertain | Verify independently | Trust questionable source |
| Provenance solid | LOW | Can assess quality | Trust with verification | Actually questionable |

---

## Q3: Is this primary or secondary/tertiary information?

[VOI: HIGH - each step from source adds distortion]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tertiary (telephone game) | HIGH | High distortion risk | Seek primary source | Distorted information |
| Unknown distance from source | MED | May be distorted | Distance check | Either distorted or direct |
| Primary source | LOW | Minimal distortion | Trust more | Actually far from source |

---

## Q4: Is there selection bias in what we're seeing?

[VOI: HIGH - selection bias = systematically misleading]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Selection bias present | HIGH | Systematically wrong | Correct for selection | Draw biased conclusions |
| Unknown if biased | MED | May be systematically wrong | Bias check | Either biased or representative |
| Representative sample | LOW | Can generalize | Generalize | Actually biased |

---

## Q5: Is the information current or stale?

[VOI: HIGH - stale information = wrong decisions for now]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Information stale | HIGH | World has changed | Update information | Decide on outdated |
| Unknown currency | MED | May be outdated | Currency check | Either outdated or current |
| Information current | LOW | Reflects now | Use directly | Actually stale |

---

## Q6: Is the source motivated to distort?

[VOI: MED - motivation affects reliability but similar verification]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Source has motive to distort | MED | Suspect information | Verify independently | Trust biased source |
| Unknown motivation | MED | May be distorted | Motivation analysis | Either trust or verify |
| Source unmotivated to distort | LOW | Less suspicious | Trust more | Actually motivated |

---

## Q7: Does the information pass basic sanity checks?

[VOI: MED - sanity failures catch obvious errors]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fails sanity check | MED | Likely wrong | Investigate error | Use obviously wrong |
| Unknown if passes | MED | May have errors | Run sanity checks | Either wrong or fine |
| Passes sanity | LOW | At least plausible | Proceed with verification | Actually fails |

---

## Q8: Is there corroborating evidence?

[VOI: MED - corroboration increases confidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No corroboration | MED | Single source risk | Seek corroboration | Trust single source |
| Unknown corroboration | MED | May be single source | Search for corroboration | Either single or multiple |
| Corroborated | LOW | Higher confidence | Trust more | Actually uncorroborated |

---

## Q9: What's the measurement precision?

[VOI: LOW - affects confidence but similar use]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Low precision | LOW | Wide error bars | Use with uncertainty | False precision |
| Unknown precision | LOW | May be imprecise | Precision check | Either precise or not |
| High precision | LOW | Tight error bars | Use confidently | Actually imprecise |

---

## Q10: Is this the right information for this decision?

[VOI: LOW - relevance affects utility but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong information | LOW | Not relevant | Find right information | Use irrelevant |
| Unknown if right | LOW | May be irrelevant | Relevance check | Either relevant or not |
| Right information | LOW | Directly useful | Use directly | Actually wrong info |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Information reliable? - foundation quality
2. Q2: Provenance? - source tracing
3. Q3: Primary or secondary? - distortion distance
4. Q4: Selection bias? - systematic error
5. Q5: Current or stale? - temporal validity

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Source motivated to distort? - incentive analysis
7. Q7: Passes sanity? - obvious errors
8. Q8: Corroboration? - single source risk

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Measurement precision? - error bars
10. Q10: Right information? - relevance

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ epistemological sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"What's the measurement precision?" matters but has LOW VOI - you use the information with appropriate uncertainty either way.

"Is the information reliable?" has HIGH VOI - unreliable information means all conclusions are suspect.

## Garbage In, Garbage Out

Perfect reasoning on bad information produces bad conclusions.

**The Information Quality Stack:**
1. **Reliability**: Is it true?
2. **Provenance**: Where did it come from?
3. **Currency**: Is it still true?
4. **Completeness**: What's missing?
5. **Selection**: What determined what we see?
6. **Precision**: How accurate is it?
7. **Relevance**: Does it matter for this decision?

Most people check reliability if anything. Few check selection bias or provenance.

**The move**: Before reasoning, audit your information. Bad inputs invalidate everything downstream.
