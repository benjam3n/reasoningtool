## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ customer value**

**VOI = action divergence**

Q1 "Is customer satisfied?" is HIGH VOI because:
- YES → maintain current approach
- NO → must understand issue and intervene (different work)

Q10 "Customer status (active/inactive/prospect)?" is MED VOI because:
- ACTIVE → regular engagement
- INACTIVE → reactivation approach (same goal of relationship, different tactics)

Satisfaction determines whether the relationship is at risk. Status determines which playbook to use for relationship maintenance.
