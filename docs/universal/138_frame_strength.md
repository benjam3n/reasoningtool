## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

| Unknown whose frame | MED | May be disadvantaged | Frame analysis | Either disadvantaged or advantaged |
| Our frame dominant | LOW | We're advantaged | Maintain frame | Actually in their frame |

---

## Q3: Is the current frame serving our goals?

[VOI: HIGH - bad frame = lose even if we win within it]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Frame doesn't serve our goals | HIGH | Winning = losing | Change the frame | Win the battle, lose the war |
| Unknown if frame serves | MED | May be wrong game | Frame-goal analysis | Either wrong game or right |
| Frame serves our goals | LOW | Right playing field | Play within frame | Actually wrong game |

---

## Q4: Can the frame be changed?

[VOI: HIGH - changeable frames should be attacked directly]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Frame changeable but we haven't tried | HIGH | Missed reframe opportunity | Attempt reframe | Accept bad frame unnecessarily |
| Unknown if changeable | MED | May be changeable | Changeability test | Either accept or change |
| Frame not changeable | LOW | Must work within | Optimize within | Think fixed when movable |

---

## Q5: What makes a frame strong here?

[VOI: HIGH - strength ingredients determine strategy]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Strength factors unknown | HIGH | Can't strengthen | Identify strength factors | Random strengthening |
| Social proof dominates | MED | Need consensus | Build social proof | Wrong strengthening |
| Experience/authority dominates | MED | Need credibility | Demonstrate expertise | Wrong strengthening |
| Strength factors known | LOW | Can strengthen directly | Apply factors | Actually unknown |

---

## Q6: Is frame resistance actually content disagreement?

[VOI: MED - affects intervention type]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Resistance is to frame | MED | Reframing needed | Reframe | Argue content against frame resistance |
| Unknown resistance type | MED | May be fighting wrong | Resistance analysis | Either reframe or argue wrong |
| Resistance is to content | LOW | Argumentation needed | Argue content | Reframe when should argue |

---

## Q7: Is there a win-win frame available?

[VOI: MED - win-win is more durable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Win-win possible but not using | MED | Missing durability | Find win-win frame | Win-lose when could win-win |
| Unknown if win-win possible | MED | May be missing | Win-win search | Either miss or find |
| Win-win not possible | LOW | Must win-lose | Accept zero-sum | Think zero-sum when positive |
| Using win-win | LOW | Durable frame | Maintain | Actually win-lose |

---

## Q8: Are we operating in multiple frames simultaneously?

[VOI: MED | Affects coherence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conflicting frames | MED | Incoherent | Resolve frame conflict | Incoherent communication |
| Unknown frame consistency | MED | May be incoherent | Frame audit | Either incoherent or clear |
| Single consistent frame | LOW | Coherent | Maintain | Actually conflicting |

---

## Q9: What frame does the audience default to?

[VOI: LOW - affects bridging but similar core]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Default frame unknown | LOW | Hard to bridge | Research their default | Bridge to wrong frame |
| Default frame different | LOW | Need bridging | Build bridge | Miss bridging need |
| Default frame same | LOW | Easy communication | Direct communication | Actually different |

---

## Q10: Is frame persistence more important than frame winning?

[VOI: LOW - affects strategy but similar frame work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Persistence matters most | LOW | Long game | Build sustainable frame | Win then lose frame |
| Winning matters most | LOW | Short game | Win decisively | Build when should win |
| Unknown which matters | LOW | May misplay | Timeline analysis | Either wrong game |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Frame or content determines? - focus allocation
2. Q2: Whose frame dominant? - current position
3. Q3: Frame serves our goals? - right game
4. Q4: Frame changeable? - reframe opportunity
5. Q5: What makes frames strong here? - strength factors

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Resistance to frame or content? - intervention type
7. Q7: Win-win available? - durability
8. Q8: Multiple frames? - coherence

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Their default frame? - bridging
10. Q10: Persistence vs winning? - timeline

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ rhetorical sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"What frame does the audience default to?" is useful but has LOW VOI - you bridge either way.

"Whose frame is currently dominant?" has HIGH VOI - if you're in their frame, you're fighting uphill.

## Frame Control Principles

From negotiation and persuasion research:

**The strongest frame tends to win, regardless of content quality.**

Frame strength comes from:
- Social proof (others accept this frame)
- Authority/experience (speaker has standing)
- Emotional resonance (frame feels right)
- First-mover advantage (frame was set early)
- Congruence (frame matches reality well)

**The trap:** Optimizing content while accepting their frame. You win arguments but lose outcomes.

**The move:** Before engaging on content, assess the frame. If it's not yours and doesn't serve you, reframe before continuing.
