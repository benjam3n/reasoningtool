## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q11: How many hours per week available? (fundamental feasibility)
2. Q4: Which gaps depend on factors outside my control? (external dependencies)
3. Q5: What will the state be in 6 months without action? (urgency)
4. Q7: What forces are causing movement away from goal? (what's working against)
5. Q12: What commitments compete for resources? (resource feasibility)
6. Q9: What similar goals have I pursued before? (learning from past)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: What is the measurable gap? (scale of work)
8. Q2: Which dimensions have largest gaps? (focus areas)
9. Q8: What rate of progress is required? (pacing)
10. Q6: What forces are causing movement toward goal? (leverage)
11. Q10: What patterns appear in previous attempts? (learn from history)
12. Q3: Which gaps require most resources? (budget planning)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "How much time is available?" is HIGH VOI because ZERO → free up time first or abandon, SIGNIFICANT → proceed with planning. These are fundamentally different paths.

Current state assessment determines whether the goal is even feasible and what approach to take.
