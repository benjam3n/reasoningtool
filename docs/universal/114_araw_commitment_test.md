# Universal: ARAW Commitment Test (114)

**Category**: META - Using ARAW to Determine What Can Be Committed To
**Source**: [D: from insight that ASSUME WRONG chains reveal foundations]
**Structure**: One question per entry, CRUX-marked with realistic distribution
**Purpose**: Use ARAW chain to test if something can be committed to

## The Core Insight

**The test for commitment:**
1. Take a statement
2. Follow the ASSUME WRONG path
3. Keep following ASSUME WRONG branches
4. Does the chain eventually CONTRADICT ITSELF?

```
If ASSUME WRONG chain → CONTRADICTION
  → Original statement is FOUNDATIONAL
  → CAN COMMIT

If ASSUME WRONG chain → STAYS COHERENT
  → Original statement contains guesses
  → CANNOT COMMIT (stays OPEN)
```

## Why This Works

Following ASSUME WRONG is like proof by contradiction:
- If assuming the opposite leads to logical impossibility
- Then the original must be true
- Because the opposite cannot be coherently maintained

The key is: **Does the chain circle back and contradict itself?**
Not just "does it feel wrong" but "is it logically inconsistent?"

## Example: "Reality Exists"

```
Statement: Reality exists

ASSUME WRONG: Reality does not exist
├─ But something is happening (this questioning)
│  ASSUME WRONG: Nothing is happening
│  ├─ But "nothing happening" is itself something
│  │  ASSUME WRONG: It's not something
│  │  ├─ Then what is this?
│  │  │  ASSUME WRONG: There is no "this"
│  │  │  ├─ But denying "this" presupposes "this"
│  │  │  └─ CONTRADICTION: Can't deny without affirming
│  │  └─ ← Contradiction reached
│  └─ ← Contradiction reached
└─ ← Contradiction reached

Result: ASSUME WRONG chain contradicts itself
Conclusion: "Reality exists" CAN BE COMMITTED TO
```

## Example: "I'm Hungry"

```
Statement: I'm hungry

ASSUME WRONG: I'm not hungry
├─ What am I experiencing then?
│  ├─ Maybe thirst misidentified as hunger → COHERENT
│  ├─ Maybe anxiety misidentified as hunger → COHERENT
│  ├─ Maybe boredom misidentified as hunger → COHERENT
│  ├─ Maybe habit/expectation → COHERENT
│  └─ All paths remain logically consistent
└─ ASSUME WRONG chain does NOT contradict itself

Result: ASSUME WRONG chain stays coherent
Conclusion: "I'm hungry" CANNOT BE COMMITTED TO (remains a guess)
```

## CRUX Rating Guide
- **HIGH** (10-25%): Stopping chain too early / missing contradiction
- **MED** (40-50%): Incomplete exploration of ASSUME WRONG paths
- **LOW** (30-40%): Minor chain extension

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 14
ENTRIES: 80

CRUX Distribution:
- HIGH: 28 entries (35%)
- MED: 36 entries (45%)
- LOW: 16 entries (20%)

THE ARAW COMMITMENT TEST:

1. Take statement S
2. Form ASSUME WRONG: NOT-S
3. Follow the chain: What does NOT-S imply?
4. Keep following: What does that imply?
5. Check each step: Does it contradict?

IF chain reaches CONTRADICTION:
  → S is FOUNDATIONAL
  → CAN COMMIT to S

IF chain stays COHERENT:
  → S contains guesses
  → CANNOT COMMIT (stays OPEN)
  → Work with S as a guess

EXAMPLE OUTCOMES:

"Reality exists"
  ASSUME WRONG → "Reality doesn't exist"
  → But this claim exists → CONTRADICTION
  → FOUNDATIONAL, CAN COMMIT

"I'm hungry"
  ASSUME WRONG → "I'm not hungry"
  → Could be thirst → COHERENT
  → Could be anxiety → COHERENT
  → No contradiction → GUESS, CANNOT COMMIT

"A = A"
  ASSUME WRONG → "A ≠ A"
  → Then A could be NOT-A
  → Then this claim (A) could be its negation
  → CONTRADICTION
  → FOUNDATIONAL, CAN COMMIT

"This approach will work"
  ASSUME WRONG → "It won't work"
  → Coherent alternative → COHERENT
  → GUESS, CANNOT COMMIT

THE KEY:
Not "does it feel wrong?" but "is it LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE?"
Contradiction = self-refuting, performative impossibility, P and NOT-P
Coherent = could be otherwise, alternatives exist
```
