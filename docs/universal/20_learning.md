## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**
**VOI = Action Divergence**

A learning aspect being "important" doesn't make it HIGH-VOI. The question is: does knowing the answer change what you DO?

- Learning-first vs outcome-first is HIGH-VOI because approach is completely different
- No prior knowledge is HIGH-VOI because you start from foundations vs build on existing
- Some prior knowledge is LOW-VOI because approach stays similar (build incrementally)
