# Universal: Vague Terms Requiring Reconceptualization (175)

**Category**: META - Terms That Need The Space/Frame Treatment
**Source**: Pattern from session - vague terms collapse into cleaner concepts
**Structure**: Prioritized list with reconceptualization candidates

---

## Core Insight

**Many common terms are vague bundles that mask cleaner underlying concepts.**

The session demonstrated:
- "Space" + "Frame" + "Abstraction level" → collapsed to search space concepts
- "Objection" + "Obstacle" → collapsed to "what rejection reveals"

This pattern applies broadly. Terms feel distinct but often address the same underlying thing from different angles.

## Priority 1: High-Frequency Vague Terms

These appear constantly and cause confusion:

### 1.1: "Understanding" vs "Knowledge" vs "Insight"

**Current vagueness:**
- "I understand this" - what does that mean?
- "I have knowledge of X" - how is this different?
- "I had an insight" - how is this different from understanding?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- All three might be about MODEL QUALITY (how well your model predicts)
- Or about COMPRESSION (how efficiently you represent information)
- Or about TRANSFER (can you apply it elsewhere)

**Questions to ARAW:**
- Is there a meaningful distinction between understand/know/insight?
- What would collapse them into a cleaner concept?
- What does "understanding" let you DO that "not understanding" doesn't?

---

### 1.2: "Strategy" vs "Plan" vs "Approach" vs "Method"

**Current vagueness:**
- "What's your strategy?" - level of abstraction?
- "What's the plan?" - more concrete?
- "What's your approach?" - somewhere between?
- "What method?" - most concrete?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- All might be about CONSTRAINT + ORDERING at different granularities
- Or about SEARCH SPECIFICATION at different levels
- Strategy = high-level constraint on search
- Plan = ordered sequence of searches
- Method = specific search procedure

**Questions to ARAW:**
- Is there a consistent abstraction hierarchy?
- What makes something a "strategy" vs a "method"?
- Can we collapse these or are they genuinely distinct?

---

### 1.3: "Goal" vs "Objective" vs "Target" vs "Aim"

**Current vagueness:**
- Often used interchangeably
- Sometimes implies different things (goal = long-term, objective = measurable?)

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- All might be "state to achieve" with different emphasis
- Goal = desired state
- Objective = measurable criterion for reaching state
- Target = specific value to hit
- Aim = direction of movement

**Questions to ARAW:**
- Is there a real distinction or just linguistic variation?
- What would a clean taxonomy look like?

---

### 1.4: "Problem" vs "Challenge" vs "Issue" vs "Difficulty"

**Current vagueness:**
- "I have a problem" vs "I face a challenge" vs "There's an issue"
- Connotations differ but meaning overlaps

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- All might be "gap between current state and desired state"
- With different emphasis on:
  - Problem = gap + unknown solution
  - Challenge = gap + known-difficult solution
  - Issue = gap requiring attention
  - Difficulty = property of the gap (how hard)

**Questions to ARAW:**
- What distinguishes these in practice?
- Do they affect action differently?

---

## Priority 2: Methodology-Specific Vague Terms

These matter for GOSM specifically:

### 2.1: "Procedure" vs "Protocol" vs "Process" vs "Workflow"

**Current vagueness:**
- GOSM has many "procedures"
- When is something a procedure vs a process vs a protocol?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- Procedure = ordered steps to follow
- Protocol = rules governing interaction
- Process = transformation over time
- Workflow = sequence of procedures

**Questions to ARAW:**
- Is there a consistent distinction in GOSM usage?
- Should there be?

---

### 2.2: "Guess" vs "Hypothesis" vs "Conjecture" vs "Assumption"

**Current vagueness:**
- VOI files are in "guess_libraries"
- But are they guesses? Hypotheses? Assumptions?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- Guess = candidate answer with uncertainty
- Hypothesis = guess structured for testing
- Conjecture = guess without test structure
- Assumption = guess treated as true for purposes

**Questions to ARAW:**
- What actually goes in VOI files?
- Is "guess" the right term?

---

### 2.3: "Value" vs "Utility" vs "Benefit" vs "Worth"

**Current vagueness:**
- "Value of Information" - what exactly is value?
- Is VOI = VUI (Value of Uncertainty Information)?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- Value = degree to which something satisfies goals
- Utility = value as input to decision
- Benefit = positive value (vs cost)
- Worth = value relative to price

**Questions to ARAW:**
- Is VOI really about "value" or about "action divergence"?
- Should VOI be renamed?

---

### 2.4: "Context" vs "Situation" vs "Circumstance" vs "Condition"

**Current vagueness:**
- "It depends on context" - what is context exactly?
- How is it different from situation?

**Reconceptualization candidates:**
- Context = information surrounding a focal point
- Situation = current state of affairs
- Circumstance = external conditions
- Condition = constraints that apply

**Questions to ARAW:**
- What makes something "context-dependent"?
- Is context = input to evaluation function?

---

## Priority 3: Search-Specific Terms to Examine

### 3.1: "Exploration" vs "Exploitation"

- Standard terms but what exactly distinguishes them?
- Is exploration = searching new space?
- Is exploitation = deepening in known space?
- Or is it about learning vs acting?

### 3.2: "Heuristic" vs "Rule" vs "Principle"

- Heuristic = rule that usually works?
- Rule = always applies?
- Principle = why the rule works?
- These probably need reconceptualization

### 3.3: "Optimal" vs "Best" vs "Good enough"

- Optimal = globally best?
- Best = best among considered?
- Good enough = satisficing threshold?
- Related to termination and commitment

### 3.4: "Learning" vs "Adaptation" vs "Improvement"

- Learning = acquiring information?
- Adaptation = changing to fit environment?
- Improvement = getting better on criterion?
- All seem related but different

## Reconceptualization Method

For each vague term cluster:

1. **List the terms that seem overlapping**
2. **Ask what they let you DO differently** (action divergence)
3. **Ask if they address the same underlying thing**
4. **Find the underlying concept(s)**
5. **Either collapse (if same) or distinguish cleanly (if different)**
6. **Create VOI file for clean concept(s)**

---

## Next Actions

For each Priority 1 cluster:
1. Run `/araw 2x [term cluster]` to explore distinctions
2. Determine if collapse or distinguish
3. If collapse: create unified VOI file
4. If distinguish: create clean taxonomy with distinct VOI files

## Session Learning Applied

The space/frame/abstraction reconceptualization succeeded because:
- Asked "what do these actually address?"
- Found they all address "search space definition"
- Collapsed into cleaner unified concept

The objection/obstacle reconceptualization succeeded because:
- Asked "what do these reveal?"
- Found they both reveal "constraints not in original specification"
- Collapsed into "learning from rejection"

**Apply this pattern to Priority 1 terms.**
