## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Who is the primary beneficiary?
[VOI: HIGH - wrong beneficiary = solving wrong problem entirely]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| You yourself | HIGH | Self-help vs helping-others = different approach | Self-focused strategy | Wrong audience entirely |
| Your family | HIGH | Different stakeholder dynamics, different success criteria | Family-oriented planning | Wrong beneficiary |
| Your customers/clients | HIGH | Fundamentally different relationship (serving vs being served) | Customer-centric approach | Internal focus |
| Society/public | HIGH | Private benefit to public good = different scope | Public good orientation | Wrong scope entirely |
| Non-human (environment, animals) | HIGH | Completely different ethical framework and methods | Ecological focus | Wrong domain entirely |
| Unknown beneficiary | HIGH | Can't proceed without knowing this | Beneficiary clarification needed | Proceeding blind |
| Your team/colleagues | MED | Still "people you work with" - adjusts but similar frame | Team benefit alignment | Refocus on different group |

## Q2: What does the beneficiary actually want?
[VOI: HIGH - stated vs actual wants = wrong target entirely]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Something different than stated | HIGH | Wrong target entirely if you believe stated | Deeper inquiry needed | Stated wants accurate |
| They don't know what they want | HIGH | Can't solve for undefined target | Discovery process needed | Can target known want |

| Actively working on it | LOW | Just means coordinate vs lead | Support existing effort | Lead new effort |

---

## Q4: What is the beneficiary's relationship to the agent?
[VOI: HIGH - adversarial vs cooperative = different problem]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Same person (self-benefit) | HIGH | Self-help vs helping-others = completely different | Self-directed | Need to engage another |
| Adversarial relationship | HIGH | Conflict navigation vs cooperation = different | Conflict navigation | Cooperative engagement |
| No existing relationship | MED | Need relationship building, adds step | Relationship building | Can proceed directly |
| Direct relationship (family, team) | MED | Trust level changes communication, not goal | Relational trust exists | Build trust first |
| Unknown relationship | MED | Need discovery | Relationship assessment | Can proceed |
| Professional relationship | LOW | Formality changes, not goal | Professional dynamics | Different formality |

---

## Q5: Is there a secondary beneficiary?
[VOI: HIGH - conflicting secondary = trade-off management needed]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, but conflicting with primary | HIGH | Trade-off resolution fundamentally changes approach | Trade-off management needed | Simpler aligned interests |
| Yes, different from primary | MED | Need to balance interests | Multi-stakeholder approach | Simpler single focus |
| No secondary beneficiary | LOW | Single focus vs multi - adds complexity, doesn't change core | Single-focus OK | Add stakeholder consideration |
| Unknown if secondary exists | LOW | Information gap, not strategy gap | Stakeholder analysis needed | Can proceed with primary |

---

## Q6: How does the beneficiary define success?
[VOI: HIGH - undefined success = can't know when done]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Success undefined | HIGH | Can't know when done | Criteria definition needed | Have clear target |
| Quantitative metrics | MED | Changes measurement approach, not core | Measurable targets | Adjust to qualitative |
| Qualitative experience | MED | Changes measurement approach, not core | Subjective satisfaction | Adjust to objective |
| Absence of negative | MED | Problem-removal vs value-creation changes approach | Problem elimination | Creation focus |
| Presence of positive | MED | Value-creation vs problem-removal changes approach | Value creation | Removal focus |
| Comparison to alternatives | LOW | Just how they frame success, not what they want | Relative success | Absolute framing |
| Comparison to past state | LOW | Just how they frame success, not what they want | Improvement from baseline | Different benchmark |

---

## Q7: What constraints does the beneficiary face?
[VOI: HIGH - no authority = can't proceed at all]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Authority/permission | HIGH | Can't proceed at all without authority | Authority-constrained | Full authority to act |
| Unknown constraints | MED | Need discovery before committing | Constraint discovery needed | Can proceed |
| Budget/financial | MED | Shapes options but doesn't change goal | Cost-conscious solution | More options available |
| Time/schedule | MED | Shapes options but doesn't change goal | Time-bounded solution | More options available |
| Capability/skills | MED | Shapes execution but doesn't change goal | Capability-matched solution | More options available |
| Social/political | MED | May block options but not usually all | Social constraints apply | More options |
| Information/knowledge | LOW | Just means more discovery needed | Information-limited | Can proceed with known |
| Physical/logistical | LOW | Usually work-aroundable | Physical constraints | More options |
| No significant constraints | LOW | Simplifies but doesn't change approach | Full flexibility | Add constraint handling |

## Q8: How will benefit be delivered?
[VOI: MED - changes what you build, not fundamental direction]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Self-service by beneficiary | MED | Changes what you build significantly | Enablement focus | Delivery focus |
| Automatic/systemic | MED | Changes what you build significantly | System design | Manual delivery |
| Directly to beneficiary | LOW | Channel choice, not goal | Direct delivery | Use intermediary |
| Through intermediary | LOW | Channel choice, not goal | Intermediary management | Direct is possible |
| One-time delivery | LOW | Frequency, not fundamental | Single transaction | Ongoing needed |
| Ongoing/continuous | LOW | Frequency, not fundamental | Sustained relationship | One-time OK |
| Unknown mechanism | LOW | Can decide later | Delivery design needed | Mechanism clear |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Primary beneficiary) - who are we solving for?
2. **Q3** (Current state) - crisis vs normal changes everything
3. **Q2** (What they want) - stated vs actual wants
4. **Q4** (Relationship) - self vs other, cooperative vs adversarial
5. **Q6** (Success criteria) - need to know when done
6. **Q7** (Authority constraint) - can we proceed?
7. **Q5** (Secondary beneficiary) - conflicts?
8. **Q8** (Delivery mechanism) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is the beneficiary in crisis?" routes to emergency response vs normal planning. "Is the beneficiary you or someone else?" routes to self-help vs service delivery.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
