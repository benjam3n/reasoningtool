## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is this one thing or many things bundled together?
[VOI: HIGH - multiple things bundled requires decomposition vs single can be addressed directly]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Multiple things bundled | HIGH | Unbundle first vs solve incomplete | Unbundle first | Solve one, others persist |
| Unknown if bundled | MED | Bundle check vs proceed | Bundle check | Partial solution looks like failure |
| Single coherent thing | LOW | Can address directly | Direct approach | Actually multiple, solving wrong thing |

---

## Q2: Does this exist independently or only in relation?
[VOI: HIGH - relational existence requires changing relationship vs independent can be changed alone]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Relational existence | HIGH | Change the relationship vs change alone | Change the relationship | Try to change alone, fail |
| Unknown independence | MED | Independence check vs proceed | Independence check | Solo intervention fails mysteriously |
| Independent existence | LOW | Can change alone, direct | Change it directly | Actually relational, change reverts |

---

## Q3: Is this natural or constructed?
[VOI: HIGH - naturalized (feels natural but constructed) can be changed vs treating as immutable when changeable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Naturalized (constructed but feels natural) | HIGH | Denaturalize first vs accept as fixed | Denaturalize first | Accept as immutable when changeable |

---

## Q4: Is this deterministic or probabilistic?
[VOI: HIGH - chaotic (sensitive to conditions) is fundamentally unpredictable vs deterministic enables precise planning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Chaotic (sensitive to conditions) | HIGH | Robust planning vs predict | Robust planning | Predict the unpredictable, fail |
| Probabilistic | MED | Plan for distribution vs specific | Plan for distribution | Expect specific, surprised by variance |
| Unknown predictability | MED | Predictability testing vs proceed | Predictability testing | Wrong planning approach |
| Deterministic | LOW | Predictable outcome, plan specific | Plan for specific outcome | Plan specific, get distribution |

---

## Q5: Is this thing or absence of thing?
[VOI: HIGH - pseudo-presence (absence labeled as thing) requires recognizing as absence vs presence can be modified]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Pseudo-presence (absence labeled as thing) | HIGH | Recognize as absence vs act on "thing" | Recognize as absence | Act on "laziness" when motivation absent |
| Absence (thing missing) | MED | Create or accept vs try to modify | Create or accept | Try to act on nothing |
| Unknown presence/absence | MED | Presence check vs proceed | Presence check | Wrong intervention direction |
| Presence (thing exists) | LOW | Can modify or remove | Act on thing | Try to modify absence |

---

## Q6: Is this fundamental or emergent?
[VOI: HIGH - emergent requires changing interactions vs fundamental can be changed directly]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Emergent (arises from interaction) | HIGH | Change interactions vs change parts | Change interactions | Fix parts, pattern persists |
| Unknown if emergent | MED | Emergence testing vs proceed | Emergence testing | Part-level intervention fails |
| Fundamental (basic) | LOW | Change directly | Direct intervention | Actually emergent, parts don't help |

---

## Q7: What category of thing is this?
[VOI: HIGH - unknown category means using wrong tools vs known enables right approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown category | HIGH | Category determination vs guess | Category determination | Wrong tools, wrong outcomes |
| Social/institutional | MED | Use social tools vs material | Use social tools | Treat social as physical, backfire |
| Abstract/conceptual | MED | Use conceptual tools vs physical | Use conceptual tools | Apply material tools to ideas, fail |
| Hybrid | MED | Combine approaches vs miss aspect | Combine approaches | Miss one aspect entirely |
| Physical/concrete | LOW | Material constraints apply, use physical tools | Use physical tools | Apply physical tools to abstract, fail |

---

## Q8: Is this thing or process?
[VOI: MED - thing vs process requires different interventions but both can be addressed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Process (dynamic) | MED | Change the process vs change thing | Change the process | Fix symptom, process recreates it |
| Both (thing in process) | MED | Address both vs miss aspect | Change thing and process | Miss one aspect |
| Unknown thing/process | MED | Thing/process analysis vs proceed | Thing/process analysis | Wrong intervention type |
| Thing (static state) | LOW | Can modify directly | Change the thing | Thing keeps reverting (it's a process) |

---

## Q9: Is this discrete or continuous?
[VOI: MED - continuous vs discrete affects precision but both can be analyzed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Continuous (shading) | MED | Use spectrums vs impose boundaries | Use spectrums | Impose false boundaries, miss nuance |
| Both (discrete aspects, continuous aspects) | MED | Multiple approaches vs miss aspect | Combine | Miss one aspect |
| Unknown discreteness | LOW | Boundary testing vs proceed | Boundary testing | Wrong precision level |
| Discrete (clear boundaries) | LOW | Can categorize cleanly | Use categories | Treat continuous as discrete, miss gradations |

---

## Q10: What level of description is appropriate?
[VOI: MED - wrong level misses mechanism or emergent properties but can be adjusted]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too low (reductive) | MED | Zoom out vs miss emergence | Zoom out | Explain psychology with physics, miss point |
| Too high (abstract) | MED | Zoom in vs miss mechanism | Zoom in | Can't intervene at abstract level |
| Unknown right level | MED | Level testing vs proceed | Level testing | Wrong level of intervention |
| Right level for purpose | LOW | Useful description | Use this level | Explanation at wrong level, useless |

---

## Q11: Does this have identity over time?
[VOI: MED - no persistent identity requires treating each instance fresh vs persistent can be tracked]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No persistent identity | MED | Treat each instance fresh vs track | Treat each instance | Try to change "the thing" that doesn't persist |
| Identity unclear | MED | Identity analysis vs proceed | Identity analysis | Either over-generalize or under-generalize |
| Persistent identity | LOW | Can track and modify over time | Track over time | Thing is actually different each time |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Bundled? Relational? - what kind of thing
- Q3: Naturalized? - can it be changed
- Q4: Chaotic? - predictability
- Q5: Pseudo-presence? - what to intervene on
- Q6: Emergent? - level of intervention
- Q7: Unknown category? - right tools

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q8-Q11: Thing/process, discrete/continuous, level, identity

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ ontological depth or philosophical sophistication**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (unbundle vs address directly, change relationship vs change alone, robust planning vs predict). Low VOI questions refine understanding within an established ontological frame.
