## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Direct stakeholders) - who has power to block?
2. **Q3** (Power) - can anyone stop this?
3. **Q2** (Interests) - are interests aligned or conflicting?
4. **Q8** (Importance) - who is critical?
5. **Q4** (Position) - is anyone opposed?
6. **Q5** (Dynamics) - stakeholders in conflict?
7. **Q6** (Risks) - blocking risks?
8. **Q7** (Obligations) - legal requirements?
9. **Q9-Q15** (Details as needed)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Does the stakeholder have veto power?" routes to negotiation vs proceeding. "Are stakeholders in conflict?" routes to mediation vs collaboration.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
