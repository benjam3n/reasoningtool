## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is this task requiring exploration or confirmation?

[VOI: HIGH - exploration and confirmation require opposite modes]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Exploration needed, confirming | HIGH | Premature closure | Open exploration mode | Miss possibilities |
| Confirmation needed, exploring | HIGH | Never converging | Confirmation mode | Wander indefinitely |
| Unknown which needed | MED | May mismatch | Mode analysis | Either close or wander |
| Mode matches task | LOW | Appropriate | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q2: Should we be divergent (generating) or convergent (selecting)?

[VOI: HIGH - generating and selecting are opposite mental movements]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need divergent, doing convergent | HIGH | Killing ideas too early | Generate freely | Miss novel options |
| Need convergent, doing divergent | HIGH | Can't decide | Select and commit | Endless generation |
| Unknown which needed | MED | May mismatch | Phase analysis | Either miss or wander |
| Mode matches phase | LOW | Appropriate | Continue | Actually mismatched |

## Q3: Is this requiring System 1 (intuitive) or System 2 (analytical)?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong system = wrong type of thinking applied]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need analytical, using intuitive | HIGH | Missing rigor | Engage System 2 | Intuitive errors |
| Need intuitive, using analytical | HIGH | Missing patterns | Trust intuition | Over-analyze simple |
| Unknown which needed | MED | May mismatch | Task analysis | Either over or under think |
| System matches task | LOW | Appropriate | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q4: Are we being critical when we should be generative (or vice versa)?

[VOI: HIGH - criticism kills generation; generation dilutes evaluation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Critical during generation | HIGH | Killing nascent ideas | Suspend judgment | Ideas die before developing |
| Generative during evaluation | HIGH | Not actually evaluating | Apply criteria | No real selection |
| Unknown mode status | MED | May be sabotaging | Mode check | Either kill or dilute |
| Mode appropriate | LOW | Right approach | Continue | Actually wrong mode |

## Q5: Is emotion informing or hijacking?

[VOI: HIGH - hijacked cognition produces poor outcomes]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Emotion hijacking | HIGH | Irrational decisions | Regulate, then decide | Emotion-driven errors |
| Unknown if hijacking | MED | May be irrational | Emotion check | Either hijacked or informed |
| Emotion informing | LOW | Useful signal | Incorporate signal | Actually hijacking |

---

## Q6: Should we be zoomed in (detail) or zoomed out (pattern)?

[VOI: MED - affects focus but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need zoom out, in details | MED | Missing forest | Zoom out | Miss big picture |
| Need zoom in, in patterns | MED | Missing trees | Zoom in | Miss critical details |
| Unknown right zoom | MED | May be wrong level | Zoom analysis | Either forest or trees |
| Zoom appropriate | LOW | Right level | Continue | Actually wrong level |

---

## Q7: Is this requiring precision or speed?

[VOI: MED - affects thoroughness but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need precision, being fast | MED | Missing accuracy | Slow down | Errors from speed |
| Need speed, being precise | MED | Missing opportunity | Speed up | Perfect but late |
| Unknown requirement | MED | May mismatch | Speed/precision analysis | Either errors or late |
| Pace appropriate | LOW | Right balance | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q8: Should we be solo or collaborative?

[VOI: MED - affects process but similar outcome goals]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need collaboration, going solo | MED | Missing perspectives | Get input | Blind spots |
| Need solo, collaborating | MED | Too many cooks | Work alone | Coordination overhead |
| Unknown best mode | MED | May be suboptimal | Mode analysis | Either blind or slow |
| Mode appropriate | LOW | Right approach | Continue | Actually wrong mode |

---

## Q9: Are we in learning mode or performance mode?

[VOI: LOW - affects approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Learning treated as performance | LOW | Not experimenting enough | Embrace errors | Miss learning |
| Performance treated as learning | LOW | Not performing | Execute confidently | Fumble in performance |
| Unknown mode | LOW | May mismatch | Mode clarification | Either miss or fumble |
| Mode appropriate | LOW | Right stance | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q10: Are we maintaining appropriate confidence?

[VOI: LOW - affects attitude but similar actions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overconfident | LOW | Missing risks | Add humility | Blindsided |
| Underconfident | LOW | Missing opportunities | Add confidence | Too timid |
| Unknown calibration | LOW | May be miscalibrated | Confidence check | Either bold or timid |
| Confidence appropriate | LOW | Well-calibrated | Continue | Actually miscalibrated |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Exploration or confirmation? - open vs closed
2. Q2: Divergent or convergent? - generate vs select
3. Q3: System 1 or 2? - intuitive vs analytical
4. Q4: Critical or generative? - judge vs create
5. Q5: Emotion hijacking? - rational capacity

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Zoomed in or out? - detail vs pattern
7. Q7: Precision or speed? - accuracy vs timeliness
8. Q8: Solo or collaborative? - independence vs input

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Learning or performance? - stance
10. Q10: Confidence level? - calibration

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are we maintaining appropriate confidence?" matters but has LOW VOI - you do similar work either way.

"Is this requiring exploration or confirmation?" has HIGH VOI - exploration mode and confirmation mode are opposite movements.

## Mode Mismatch Is Invisible

The danger: we default to familiar modes regardless of task requirements.

**Common Mismatches:**
- Analytical minds critique during brainstorming → kill ideas
- Creative minds brainstorm during evaluation → no decisions
- Explorers explore during deadlines → never ship
- Convergers converge during discovery → premature closure

**The Six Thinking Hats insight:** Explicitly name and switch modes. Don't let default modes run unconsciously.

**The move:** Before starting, ask "What mode does this task require?" Then consciously enter that mode, even if unfamiliar.
