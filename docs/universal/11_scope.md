## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (What's in scope?) - fundamental
2. **Q2** (Who controls scope?) - authority
3. **Q3** (Will scope change?) - stability
4. **Q4** (Boundary clarity) - edge cases
5. **Q5** (Dependencies) - cross-boundary connections
6. **Q6** (Adjacent scopes) - overlap
7. **Q7** (Scale) - magnitude
8. **Q8-Q11** (Depth, breadth, exclusions, creep risks) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is scope contested?" routes to conflict resolution vs proceeding. "Are there many cross-boundary dependencies?" routes to extensive coordination vs independent work.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
