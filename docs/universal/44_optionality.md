## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Reversible? (Few → extra diligence vs move quickly)
2. Q2: Sunk costs? (Yes → fresh decision vs continue)
3. Q3: Fresh start choice? (No → change path vs continue)
4. Q4: Highest value? (No → reallocation vs proceed)
5. Q5: Alternatives? (Better exist → switch vs proceed)
6. Q6: Switch points? (Can't switch → full commitment vs flexible)
7. Q7: Goals blocked? (Critical → evaluate tradeoff vs proceed)
8. Q8: Pursuit cost? (Critical lost → evaluate vs low risk)
9. Q9: Options preserved? (Few → accept commitment vs flexible)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
10. Q10: Reversal cost? (Affects approach, not direction)
11. Q11: Goals unlock? (Affects priority, not current action)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Optionality Value**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI optionality question is one where the answer determines whether you CONTINUE or STOP/CHANGE. "Better alternatives exist" routes you to "consider switching" - a completely different path.

A LOW VOI optionality question like "how many goals unlock after" doesn't change your current action - you'll pursue the goal either way, just with different framing of the upside.
