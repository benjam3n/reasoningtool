## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q8: Who is likely to oppose? (who will resist?)
2. Q5: How much power do parties have? (can they block me?)
3. Q6: Whose participation is required? (who must cooperate?)
4. Q7: What benefit do participants receive? (will they cooperate?)
5. Q11: Is there potential for conflict? (will parties fight?)
6. Q10: Are there misaligned expectations? (will anyone be disappointed?)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: Who is affected by pursuing? (stakeholder map)
8. Q2: Who is affected by success? (impact analysis)
9. Q3: What is resource impact? (resistance prediction)
10. Q12: What would resolve conflict? (conflict management)
11. Q4: Will response be rational or emotional? (communication approach)
12. Q9: What obstruction actions possible? (defense planning)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is there anyone with high power who could be harmed?" is HIGH VOI because YES → proactively manage that stakeholder, NO → proceed without special attention. These are different resource allocation decisions.

Affected parties can enable or block your goal - understanding them is critical.
