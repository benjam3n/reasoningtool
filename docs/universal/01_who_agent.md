**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution
**Status**: Revised (VOI distribution: ~20% HIGH, ~50% MED, ~30% LOW)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Exists?) - do we have an agent or need to find/build one?
2. **Q2** (Relationship?) - stranger/adversary = different problem
3. **Q8** (No agent contingency?) - blocked or abandoned?
4. **Q9** (Specified?) - can we proceed without knowing agent?
5. **Q3** (Single/multiple/AI?) - coordination level
6. **Q7** (Changeable?) - locked in?
7. **Q4-Q6** (Capability, motivation, authority) - working relationship
8. **Q10-Q12** (Availability, quantity, criteria) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths - like a phone tree routing to different departments. "Do we need to hire someone?" routes to recruiting vs executing. "Is the agent an adversary?" routes to conflict resolution vs collaboration.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
