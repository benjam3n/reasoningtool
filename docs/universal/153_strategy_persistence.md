## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Rats stop running the maze when cheese is removed. Humans never stop. They break into the lab at night.**

When a strategy stops working:
- Rats update: no reward → stop running
- Humans persist: no reward → run harder, run at night, blame the maze

**"If what you do doesn't work, do something else."** This sounds obvious but humans systematically violate it.

The question: **When should you abandon a strategy?**

---

## Q1: Is this strategy producing results?

[VOI: HIGH - no results = change strategy]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No results, still persisting | HIGH | Wasting effort | Change strategy | Run maze forever with no cheese |
| Unknown if producing results | MED | May be wasting | Measure results | Either persist or change wrong |
| Producing results | LOW | Continue | Keep going | Actually not working |

---

## Q2: Are you naming failure instead of changing?

[VOI: HIGH - naming failure avoids updating]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Named failure ("resistant", "difficult") | HIGH | Avoiding update | Treat as feedback to change | Blame target, keep failing |
| Unknown if naming | MED | May be avoiding | Check for nominalization | Either updating or avoiding |
| Treating failure as feedback | LOW | Updating appropriately | Continue adjusting | Actually naming |

---

## Q3: How many times have you tried this exact approach?

[VOI: HIGH - repetition without results = persistence error]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Many times, same result | HIGH | Persistence error | Try different approach | Definition of insanity |
| Few times | MED | May need more data | Continue with measurement | Either persist or change |
| First time | LOW | Too early to judge | Continue | Actually repeated |

---

## Q4: What would different look like?

[VOI: MED - need alternatives to change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No alternatives identified | MED | Can't change even if should | Generate alternatives | Stuck with one approach |
| Alternatives available | LOW | Can change if needed | Ready to switch | Actually no alternatives |
| Unknown alternatives | MED | May be stuck | Search for alternatives | Either stuck or ready |

---

## Q5: Are you measuring at the right timescale?

[VOI: MED - wrong timescale = wrong conclusion]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Measuring too short (giving up too early) | MED | Premature abandonment | Extend measurement window | Abandon working strategy |
| Measuring too long (persisting too long) | MED | Delayed abandonment | Shorten window | Persist with failing strategy |
| Timescale appropriate | LOW | Correct measurement | Continue | Actually wrong timescale |

---

## Q6: Is "trying harder" the same strategy?

[VOI: MED - effort increase ≠ strategy change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Trying harder = same strategy | MED | Not actually changing | Try DIFFERENT, not harder | Exhaust yourself on same approach |
| Trying harder = different strategy | LOW | Actual change | May continue | Actually same strategy |
| Unknown if different | MED | May be fooling self | Strategy audit | Either changing or not |

---

## Q7: What's the cost of persistence?

[VOI: MED - high cost = lower threshold for change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High cost to persist | MED | Should change sooner | Lower persistence threshold | Expensive failure |
| Low cost to persist | LOW | Can persist longer | Higher threshold ok | Actually high cost |
| Unknown cost | MED | May be misjudging | Cost analysis | Either threshold |

---

## Q8: Is there identity tied to this strategy?

[VOI: MED - identity attachment blocks change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Identity attached | MED | Hard to change | Separate identity from strategy | Persist to protect identity |
| No identity attachment | LOW | Easier to change | Change when needed | Actually attached |
| Unknown attachment | MED | May be blocked | Attachment check | Either blocked or free |

---

## Q9: Did conditions change?

[VOI: LOW - explains why strategy stopped working]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conditions changed | LOW | Strategy outdated | Update to new conditions | Use old strategy in new world |
| Conditions same | LOW | Strategy may still work | Diagnose differently | Actually changed |
| Unknown if changed | LOW | May be missing context | Condition check | Either explanation |

---

## Q10: What would the rat do?

[VOI: LOW - useful heuristic but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Rat would stop | LOW | Probably should change | Consider changing | Persist when should stop |
| Rat would continue | LOW | May still work | Consider persisting | Stop when should continue |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Producing results? - fundamental check
2. Q2: Naming failure? - avoidance pattern
3. Q3: How many repetitions? - persistence error

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
4. Q4: Alternatives available? - ability to change
5. Q5: Right timescale? - measurement
6. Q6: Is "harder" actually different? - false change
7. Q7: Cost of persistence? - threshold
8. Q8: Identity attached? - blockage

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Conditions changed? - context
10. Q10: What would rat do? - heuristic

## Key Insight

**Humans have a systematic bug: they persist with failing strategies.**

The rats stopped when cheese was removed. Humans kept running. They're still running. They break into the lab at night.

**The nominalization trap**: Instead of changing behavior when it doesn't work, rename the failure as a property of the target.
- "Resistant client" = my approach doesn't work but I won't change
- "Difficult problem" = my strategy isn't working but I'll keep using it
- "Impossible situation" = I've tried one thing many times

**The fix**: If what you do doesn't work, do something else. Not harder. Different.

## The Maze Experiment

Rats: Taught to run maze for cheese.
Humans: Taught to run maze for $5.

Remove the reward.

Rats: After some trials, stop running.
Humans: Never stop. Still running. Break into lab at night.

**The lesson**: Having a "reason" for the behavior doesn't help you stop when it stops working. Humans are worse than rats at updating from failed strategies.
