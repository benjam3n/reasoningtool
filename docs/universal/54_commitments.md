---

## Q7: What is evidence they will fulfill promises?
[VOI: HIGH - Weak/unknown reliability means plan contingency vs trust]

## Q9: Have promises been made related to this goal?

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown promises | HIGH | Promise audit vs proceed | Promise audit | Promises known |
| Yes, active promises | MED | Track fulfillment vs ignore | Monitor | Fewer promises |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Obligations? (Significant/unknown → factor in vs proceed freely)
2. Q2: Non-fulfillment consequences? (Severe → must fulfill vs acceptable)
3. Q3: Conflict? (Major → resolve vs pursue both)
4. Q4: Create new? (Significant → evaluate burden vs proceed)
5. Q5: Promise status? (At risk/broken → address vs maintain)
6. Q6: Depending on others? (Yes → verify vs proceed)
7. Q7: Reliability evidence? (Weak/unknown → contingency vs trust)
8. Q8: Contingency? (None → create vs maintain)
9. Q9: Promises made? (Unknown → audit vs proceed)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
(All questions have HIGH entries, order by HIGH entry presence)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Commitment Importance**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI commitment question is one where the answer determines whether you FULFILL THE OBLIGATION or ACCEPT/MANAGE THE CONSEQUENCES. "Severe consequences for not fulfilling" routes you to "must fulfill" - a completely different action than "acceptable to miss."

A LOW VOI commitment question like "no promises made" doesn't change your fundamental approach - you'll pursue the goal either way, just with different tracking needs.

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 11 entries (28%)

- LOW: 10 entries (26%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because broken commitments have cascading consequences
