## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are we in a crisis demanding urgency or routine allowing patience?

[VOI: HIGH - crisis mode is completely different from routine]

| Unknown if crisis | MED | May mismatch | Crisis check | Either under or overreact |
| Routine | LOW | Normal operation | Standard approach | Crisis mode for routine, exhaust |

---

## Q2: Is there a window that will close?

[VOI: HIGH - missed window = missed opportunity forever]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Window closing | HIGH | Urgency real | Act now | Miss opportunity forever |
| Unknown window | MED | May close | Window check | Either miss or rush |
| Window open | LOW | Flexible | Plan thoroughly | Rush unnecessarily |

---

## Q3: Is past performance predictive of future?

[VOI: HIGH - conditions changed = history misleads]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conditions changed | HIGH | Past irrelevant | Fresh analysis | Use outdated information |
| Unknown if changed | MED | May be misleading | Change check | Either ignore useful or rely on stale |
| Past predicts future | LOW | Can extrapolate | Use history | Conditions changed, history misleads |

## Q4: Does this compound negatively over time?

[VOI: HIGH - small problem becomes crisis if compounds]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Compounds negatively | HIGH | Gets worse | Act now | Small problem becomes crisis |
| Unknown compounding | MED | May grow | Compounding check | Miss growth or decay |
| Compounds positively | MED | Grows over time | Start early | Miss compounding benefit |
| Reversible | LOW | Can undo | Lower stakes | Actually compounds |

---

## Q5: Is there significant lag between action and result?

[VOI: HIGH - lag creates overshoot and oscillation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Significant lag | HIGH | Correction delayed | Act and wait | Over-correct before effect shows |
| Unknown lag | MED | May oscillate | Lag measurement | Either over or under correct |
| Immediate feedback | LOW | Can correct quickly | Act and observe | Overshoot from unnoticed lag |

---

## Q6: Are we in the right time horizon?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong horizon = mismatched approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong horizon | HIGH | Mismatched approach | Shift horizon | Short-term tactics for long-term |
| Unknown right horizon | MED | May mismatch | Horizon check | Approach mismatch |
| Short-term appropriate | LOW | Immediate focus | Quick action | Miss long-term |
| Long-term appropriate | LOW | Strategic focus | Patient approach | Urgent needs unmet |

---

## Q7: What's the relevant time scale?

[VOI: MED - affects planning but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong time scale | HIGH | Missing relevant factors | Adjust scale | Consider irrelevant, miss relevant |
| Unknown right scale | MED | May mismatch | Scale check | Either over or under consider |
| Right time scale | LOW | Appropriate planning | Use scale | Wrong factors considered |

---

## Q8: Are we being present-biased or future-biased?

[VOI: MED - affects weighting but similar decision process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Present-biased | MED | Under-weighting future | Increase future weight | Sacrifice future for now |
| Future-biased | MED | Under-weighting present | Increase present weight | Sacrifice now for uncertain future |
| Unknown bias | MED | May be distorted | Bias check | Unknowingly biased |
| Appropriately balanced | LOW | Good weighting | Proceed | Biased without knowing |

---

## Q9: Is this a one-time event or recurring pattern?

[VOI: MED - affects whether to systematize]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown if recurring | MED | May waste effort | Pattern check | Either over or under systematize |
| One-time | MED | Won't repeat | Handle as unique | Build system for one-time |
| Recurring | MED | Will repeat | Build system | Treat recurring as unique each time |

---

## Q10: Is the sequence important?

[VOI: LOW - affects ordering but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sequence matters | LOW | Order required | Follow sequence | Do out of order, fail |
| Unknown if matters | LOW | May break | Sequence check | Either waste time or break |
| Sequence flexible | LOW | Can parallelize | Optimize order | Unnecessarily sequential |

---

## Q11: Is this time-sensitive or time-invariant?

[VOI: LOW - affects urgency but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Time-sensitive | LOW | Must act in window | Act within window | Miss window |
| Unknown sensitivity | LOW | May miss window | Sensitivity check | Either rush or miss |
| Time-invariant | LOW | Can act anytime | Flexible timing | Rush when can relax |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Crisis or routine? - mode of operation
2. Q2: Window closing? - urgency
3. Q3: Past predicts future? - data validity
4. Q4: Compounds negatively? - problem growth
5. Q5: Significant lag? - feedback timing
6. Q6: Right horizon? - approach match

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
7. Q7: Relevant time scale? - planning
8. Q8: Present/future bias? - weighting
9. Q9: One-time or recurring? - systematization

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
10. Q10: Sequence important? - ordering
11. Q11: Time-sensitive? - urgency detail

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ temporal precision. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the sequence important?" affects ordering but has LOW VOI - you still do similar work.

"Is there a window that will close?" has HIGH VOI - missing the window means missing the opportunity entirely.
