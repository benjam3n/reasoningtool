## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Above capacity? (Yes → reduce or burnout vs maintain)
2. Q2: Cognitive overload? (Yes → reduce load vs continue)
3. Q3: Motivation sufficient? (No → boost vs continue)
4. Q4: Momentum? (Stalled/declining → intervene vs maintain)
5. Q5: Too many tasks? (Significantly → aggressive prioritization vs proceed)
6. Q6: Surge capacity? (None → build buffer vs use peaks)
7. Q7: Decision fatigue? (Significant → reduce decisions vs continue)
8. Q8: Attention allocation? (Poor → realign vs maintain)
9. Q9: Attention traps? (Major → escape vs continue)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
10. Q10: Rate limit? (Planning, not direction)
11. Q11: Externalize? (Relief, not direction)
12. Q12: Duration? (Sustainability planning, not direction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Energy Level**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI capacity question is one where the answer determines whether you CONTINUE or STOP/CHANGE APPROACH. "Above sustainable capacity" routes you to "reduce or face burnout" - a completely different action than "maintain current pace."

A LOW VOI capacity question like "short vs long duration" doesn't change your fundamental approach - you'll pursue the goal either way, just with different pacing.
