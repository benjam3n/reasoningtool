## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**"Meaning" can be constructed from physical consequences OR from emotional responses. Mismatching the construction method = miscommunication.**

**Physical consequence meaning** (external direction):
- "What does this mean?" → "What happens next in the world?"
- Event A means Event B will follow
- Negotiation → vacation canceled → meaning is schedule impact
- Facts and actions are the substance; emotions are secondary

**Emotional response meaning** (internal direction):
- "What does this mean?" → "How does this affect my feelings?"
- Event A means Emotion B, which leads to Emotion C
- Negotiation → stress → "Am I always putting work first?" → "What does this say about me?"
- Emotions are the substance; facts are just outlines

**The arbitrary connection**: Any X can be made to "mean" any Z through enjoyable analogy Y.

## Q1: How is the receiver constructing meaning?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong construction = miscommunication]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

## Q3: Can we use P.E.A. (Proof by Enjoyable Analogy)?

## Q4: Is the emotional cascade being leveraged?

[VOI: MED - cascading deepens meaning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

| Unknown cascade availability | MED | May be missing depth | Cascade check | Either cascade or not |
| Cascade being used | LOW | Deep meaning | Continue | Actually not cascading |

---

## Q5: Is the meaning connecting to identity?

[VOI: MED - identity connection = most influential meaning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can connect to identity but not | MED | Missing deepest level | Add identity link | Stop at shallow |
| Unknown if identity connectable | MED | May be possible | Identity connection test | Either connect or not |
| Connected to identity | LOW | Maximum depth | Maintain | Actually not connected |

---

## Q6: Is the bridge imagery pleasant?

[VOI: MED - pleasant bridges transfer better]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unpleasant bridge | MED | Transfer resisted | Use pleasant imagery | Negative association |
| Unknown pleasantness | MED | May be blocking | Pleasantness check | Either pleasant or not |
| Pleasant bridge | LOW | Transfer smooth | Continue | Actually unpleasant |

---

## Q7: Is there meaning competition?

[VOI: MED - competing meanings create confusion]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Competing meanings present | MED | Confusion/ambivalence | Resolve competition | Multiple meanings clash |
| Unknown if competition | MED | May have conflict | Competition check | Either clear or competing |
| Single meaning dominant | LOW | Clear assignment | Continue | Actually competing |

---

## Q8: Is the meaning being reinforced?

[VOI: LOW - reinforcement strengthens but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not reinforcing | LOW | Weaker assignment | Add repetition | Meaning fades |
| Unknown reinforcement | LOW | May be weak | Reinforcement check | Either strong or weak |
| Reinforcing well | LOW | Strong assignment | Continue | Actually not reinforcing |

---

## Q9: Is the meaning testable?

[VOI: LOW - affects verification but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Testable meaning | LOW | Can verify | Test if needed | Skip verification |
| Untestable meaning | LOW | Cannot verify | Accept | Try to test untestable |
| Unknown testability | LOW | May be verifiable | Testability check | Either test or not |

---

## Q10: Is the meaning durable?

[VOI: LOW - durability affects longevity but similar assignment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fragile meaning | LOW | Will fade | Reinforce or accept | Assume lasting |
| Unknown durability | LOW | May fade | Durability check | Either lasting or not |
| Durable meaning | LOW | Will persist | Continue | Actually fragile |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: How do they construct meaning? - communication match
2. Q2: What meaning to create? - target
3. Q3: Can use P.E.A.? - assignment tool

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
4. Q4: Cascade being leveraged? - depth
5. Q5: Identity connection? - influence
6. Q6: Bridge imagery pleasant? - transfer
7. Q7: Meaning competition? - clarity

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Meaning reinforced? - strength
9. Q9: Meaning testable? - verification
10. Q10: Meaning durable? - longevity

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth about meaning. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the meaning durable?" affects longevity but has LOW VOI - similar assignment process either way.

"How is the receiver constructing meaning?" has HIGH VOI - mismatched construction = talking past each other.

## Two Meaning Systems

**Physical Consequence System**:
```
Event A → Event B (physical) → Meaning = impact on world
```
- "What does getting promoted mean?" → "More money, better office, new responsibilities"
- Facts are primary, emotions secondary
- Logic and evidence persuade

**Emotional Response System**:
```
Event A → Emotion B → Emotion C → Meaning = emotional result
```
- "What does getting promoted mean?" → "Feeling valued" → "Permission to be confident" → "Connecting with who I truly am"
- Emotions are primary, facts are outlines
- Experience and imagery persuade

---

## The P.E.A. Formula

**When you X, it's like Y, which leads to a feeling of Z**

- X = any event or emotion (starting point)
- Y = enjoyable bridge imagery
- Z = target meaning/emotion (destination)

**Example**:
"When you feel really connected to someone, it's like there's a glittering iridescent chain connecting your hearts, and this is a sign you and this person are meant to be together."

- X = feeling connected
- Y = glittering chain imagery
- Z = meant to be together (destiny)

**The connection is arbitrary but feels logical** because the bridge imagery (Y) makes it feel like a natural progression.

**Power**: You can connect ANY X to ANY Z with the right bridge imagery.

---

## Meaning Is Assignable

**The trap**: Assuming meaning is inherent in events. "What does this event REALLY mean?"

**The truth**: Meaning is constructed, not discovered. The same event can "mean" completely different things depending on how the connection is made.

**The move**: Before communicating, ask:
1. How does the receiver construct meaning?
2. What meaning do I want to create?
3. What bridge imagery connects the event to my target meaning?

Then assign meaning deliberately rather than leaving it to chance.
