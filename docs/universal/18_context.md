## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**
**VOI = Action Divergence**

A context being "important" doesn't make it HIGH-VOI. The question is: does knowing the answer change what you DO?

- Crisis mode is HIGH-VOI because crisis → emergency response; normal → standard approach
- Regulatory unknown is HIGH-VOI because you must research before acting
- Moderate competition is LOW-VOI because the approach stays similar regardless
