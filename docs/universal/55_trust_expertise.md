## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Expertise required? (Specialized → source vs proceed alone)
2. Q2: Have expertise? (No → acquire/partner vs proceed)
3. Q4: Who has it? (Inaccessible/None → find access/pioneer vs engage)
4. Q5: Trusting? (Significant/unknown → verify vs proceed)
5. Q6: Trust basis? (Necessity/default/unknown → examine vs trust)
6. Q7: Misplaced impact? (Major → verify/hedge vs accept)
7. Q3: Acquirable? (No → hire/partner vs learn)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
8. Q8: Verification cost? (Decision, not direction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Expertise Level**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI trust/expertise question is one where the answer determines whether you CAN DO THIS ALONE or NEED HELP. "Lack specialized expertise" routes you to "acquire or partner" - a completely different approach than "proceed with what you have."

A LOW VOI trust/expertise question like "expert level vs adequate level" doesn't change your fundamental approach - you'll proceed either way, just with different confidence levels.
