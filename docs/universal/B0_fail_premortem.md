## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (All questions are HIGH VOI for pre-mortem)**

Questions are already ordered by error type progression:
1. Q1-Q3: Input errors (perception, memory, interpretation)
2. Q4-Q8: Processing biases (source, selection, confirmation, availability, anchoring)
3. Q9-Q11: Motivational errors (overconfidence, motivated reasoning, social pressure)
4. Q12-Q14: Framing errors (false dichotomy, scope, timing)
5. Q15-Q17: Reasoning errors (causation, base rate, sunk cost)
6. Q18-Q20: Meta errors (hindsight, attribution, unknown unknowns)

**All pre-mortem questions are HIGH VOI** because each identifies a different mitigation strategy.

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Failure Likelihood**. A rare failure mode can still be HIGH VOI if it requires a completely different mitigation approach.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. In pre-mortem, almost everything is HIGH VOI because each failure type requires a specific, different mitigation strategy.

---

## Usage Note

For pre-mortem, assume failure occurred.
Ask each question: "Did failure occur due to X?"
Mark all HIGH-VOI "ASSUME RIGHT" answers as risks to mitigate.
