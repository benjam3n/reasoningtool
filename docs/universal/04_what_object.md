## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Exists?) - do we have an object or need to create?
2. **Q2** (Access?) - can we reach it?
3. **Q3** (Specificity?) - do we know what we're targeting?
4. **Q5** (Ownership?) - disputed?
5. **Q4** (Complexity?) - chaotic = different approach
6. **Q6** (Value?) - irreplaceable?
7. **Q7** (Category?) - abstract vs concrete
8. **Q8-Q14** (Details as needed)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Does the object exist?" routes to creation vs modification. "Is the object inaccessible?" routes to barrier removal vs direct work.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
