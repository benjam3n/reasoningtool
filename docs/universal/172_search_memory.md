# Universal: Search Memory (172)

**Category**: SEARCH - What To Remember From Search?
**Source**: Learning theory, memoization, knowledge management
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Search produces information. Memory determines what's available later.**

Without memory:
- Repeat failed searches
- Lose successful patterns
- Can't build on progress
- Each search starts from zero

Memory enables: learning, acceleration, building, transfer.

## Q1: What should be remembered from this search?

[VOI: HIGH - memory selection]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| The answer found | HIGH | Remember solution | Can reuse | Repeat search |
| The path to the answer | HIGH | Remember method | Can replicate | Know what, not how |
| What didn't work | HIGH | Remember failures | Avoid repetition | Repeat mistakes |
| The space explored | MED | Remember coverage | Know what's left | Re-explore |
| Why it worked | HIGH | Remember principles | Can generalize | Only rote memory |

---

## Q2: How long will this information be useful?

[VOI: HIGH - memory duration]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Long-term (permanent) | HIGH | Store durably, index well | Available when needed | Lost when needed |
| Short-term (this project) | MED | Working memory sufficient | Efficient | Over-invest in storage |
| Unknown | MED | Err toward storing | Safe | May store useless |

---

## Q3: Is this information likely to become stale?

[VOI: MED - staleness risk]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, will become stale | MED | Time-stamp, plan refresh | Accurate when used | Use stale info |
| No, stable information | LOW | Store and trust | Reliable | Miss staleness |

---

## Q4: How will you retrieve this information?

[VOI: HIGH - retrieval design]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| By topic/category | MED | Organize by subject | Find when browsing | Miss if wrong category |
| By trigger/cue | MED | Associate with retrieval cue | Automatic retrieval | Wrong cue, no retrieval |
| By search | MED | Make searchable | Find with effort | Lost in unsearchable store |
| Multiple methods | HIGH | Redundant access | Robust retrieval | Over-engineering |

---

## Q5: Should you externalize this memory?

[VOI: MED - internal vs external memory]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, write it down | MED | External record | Reliable, shareable | Access overhead |
| No, remember internally | MED | Mental model | Fast access | Forgetting risk |
| Both | LOW | Redundancy | Robust | Effort |

---

## Q6: Is this generalizable or specific?

[VOI: MED - generalization level]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Generalizable pattern | MED | Extract principle | Broader utility | Over-generalize |
| Specific instance | LOW | Store as case | Accurate for case | Miss generalization |

---

## Q7: Who else might need this information?

[VOI: MED - sharing decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Others will need it | MED | Make shareable | Collective benefit | Effort to share |
| Only I will need it | LOW | Personal storage | Efficient | Miss sharing value |

---

## Q8: What's the forgetting risk?

[VOI: LOW - forgetting mitigation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High forgetting risk | LOW | Use spaced repetition, external storage | Retained | Lost |
| Low forgetting risk | LOW | Minimal storage | Efficient | May forget anyway |

## What to Remember

| Type | Value | How to Store |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Solutions** | Reuse | Cache with retrieval key |
| **Methods** | Replicate | Document procedure |
| **Failures** | Avoid | Anti-pattern list |
| **Principles** | Generalize | Extracted rule |
| **Coverage** | Navigate | Map of explored space |
| **Heuristics** | Speed up | Rule of thumb |

## Memory Structures

| Structure | Best For | Weakness |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **List** | Sequential recall | No relationships |
| **Tree** | Hierarchical knowledge | Single inheritance |
| **Graph** | Connected knowledge | Complex to navigate |
| **Cache** | Frequently accessed | Eviction policy needed |
| **Index** | Search retrieval | Maintenance overhead |

## Search Memory Checklist

After completing a search, consider storing:

- [ ] The answer/solution found
- [ ] The path taken to find it
- [ ] Alternative paths considered
- [ ] Paths that failed and why
- [ ] Surprising findings
- [ ] Time/effort spent
- [ ] Quality of result
- [ ] What would do differently
- [ ] Generalizable patterns
- [ ] Domain-specific learnings

## Common Memory Errors

| Error | Pattern | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **No memory** | Each search from scratch | Deliberate storage |
| **Only successes** | Remember wins, forget losses | Store failures too |
| **No retrieval cue** | Stored but can't find | Design retrieval path |
| **Over-specific** | Remember case, miss pattern | Extract principles |
| **Over-general** | Remember pattern, lose detail | Keep examples |
| **Stale memory** | Use outdated information | Timestamp and refresh |
