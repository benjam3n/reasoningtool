## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: If progress is lost, can it be recovered?
[VOI: HIGH - Not recoverable/unknown means extra protection vs proceed normally]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, not recoverable | HIGH | Extra protection vs proceed | Extra protection | Recoverable |
| Unknown recoverability | HIGH | Recovery analysis vs proceed | Recovery analysis | Recoverability known |
| Yes, partially | MED | Protect key work vs proceed | Protect key work | Different level |
| Yes, fully recoverable | LOW | Safe to proceed either way | Proceed | Less recoverable |

## Q2: Is there a point beyond which recovery is not possible?
[VOI: HIGH - Point exists/unknown means know and avoid vs less worry]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, point exists | HIGH | Know and avoid vs less worry | Know and avoid | No such point |
| Unknown if point exists | HIGH | Point discovery vs assume safe | Point discovery | Point known |
| No such point | LOW | Always recoverable either way | Less worry | Point exists |

---

## Q3: How close is current state to that point?
[VOI: HIGH - Very close/unknown means danger zone, pull back vs continue]
Prerequisite: Q2 shows point exists

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Very close | HIGH | Pull back vs continue | Pull back | Further |
| Unknown proximity | HIGH | Proximity check vs assume safe | Proximity check | Proximity known |
| Moderately close | MED | Monitor vs relax | Monitor | Different distance |
| Far from point | LOW | Safe margin either way | Continue | Closer |

---

## Q4: What is the recovery process?
[VOI: HIGH - No process means unprepared, create process vs maintain]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No process exists | HIGH | Create process vs maintain | Create process | Process exists |
| Unknown process | MED | Process development vs assume | Process development | Process known |
| Partial process | MED | Complete process vs maintain | Complete process | Different level |
| Clear process exists | LOW | Prepared either way | Maintain | No process |

---

## Q5: How long does recovery take?
[VOI: HIGH - Long recovery means major setback, prevent loss vs accept risk]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Long (months) | HIGH | Prevent loss vs accept | Prevent loss | Shorter |
| Unknown duration | MED | Duration estimate vs assume | Duration estimate | Duration known |
| Moderate (weeks) | MED | Plan for vs accept | Plan for | Different duration |
| Quick (hours/days) | LOW | Fast recovery either way | Acceptable | Longer |

---

## Q6: What resources does recovery require?
[VOI: HIGH - Extensive resources means major investment, prevent loss vs accept]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Extensive resources | HIGH | Prevent loss vs accept | Prevent loss | Fewer resources |
| Unknown resources | MED | Resource assessment vs assume | Resource assessment | Resources known |
| Moderate resources | MED | Prepare resources vs accept | Prepare resources | Different level |
| Minimal resources | LOW | Easy recovery either way | Acceptable | More resources |

---

## Q7: Are recovery resources available?
[VOI: HIGH - Not available means cannot recover, acquire or prevent vs use]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not available | HIGH | Acquire or prevent vs use | Acquire or prevent | Available |
| Unknown availability | MED | Availability check vs assume | Availability check | Availability known |
| Partially available | MED | Secure rest vs accept | Secure rest | Different level |
| Yes, available | LOW | Can recover either way | Maintain availability | Not available |

---

## Q8: What would be required to start over?
[VOI: HIGH - Major restart cost means high stakes, strong protection vs accept risk]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Major restart cost | HIGH | Strong protection vs accept | Strong protection | Lower cost |
| Unknown restart cost | MED | Cost assessment vs assume | Cost assessment | Cost known |
| Moderate restart cost | MED | Protect vs accept | Protect | Different cost |
| Minimal to restart | LOW | Low stakes either way | Accept risk | More required |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Recoverable? (No/unknown → extra protection vs proceed)
2. Q2: Point of no return? (Yes/unknown → know and avoid vs less worry)
3. Q3: Proximity to point? (Very close/unknown → pull back vs continue)
4. Q4: Process? (None → create vs maintain)
5. Q5: Duration? (Long → prevent loss vs accept)
6. Q6: Resources needed? (Extensive → prevent loss vs accept)
7. Q7: Resources available? (No → acquire/prevent vs use)
8. Q8: Restart cost? (Major → strong protection vs accept)

**MED/LOW VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
(All questions have HIGH entries, order by recovery criticality)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Recovery Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A HIGH VOI recovery question is one where the answer determines whether you PROTECT HEAVILY or PROCEED WITH ACCEPTABLE RISK. "Not recoverable" routes you to "extra protection" - a completely different action than "proceed normally with some backup."

A LOW VOI recovery question like "minimal restart cost" doesn't change your fundamental approach - you'll pursue the goal either way, just with different protection levels.

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 8
ENTRIES: 35

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 11 entries (31%)
- MED: 15 entries (43%)
- LOW: 9 entries (26%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because recovery failures can be catastrophic
