## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q5: Which actions are being taken consistently? (current state)
2. Q6: Which actions are inconsistent? (problem areas)
3. Q7: What is preventing inconsistent actions? (root cause)
4. Q8: What trigger would initiate each action? (how to start)
5. Q3: What is consequence of missing one? (stakes)
6. Q4: What is consequence of missing multiple? (stakes)
7. Q11: Can competing behaviors be reduced? (capacity)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
8. Q1: What actions must be taken repeatedly? (inventory)
9. Q2: How frequently must each occur? (scheduling)
10. Q9: What environment changes would help? (optimization)
11. Q10: What behaviors consume needed resources? (competition)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "What is preventing inconsistent actions?" is HIGH VOI because LACK OF MOTIVATION → fix incentives, LACK OF SKILL → train, FORGETTING → add reminders. These are fundamentally different interventions.

Behaviors determine whether required actions actually get taken consistently.

Note: MED% is higher in this category because most behavior issues are adjustment-level, not strategy-level.

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 9 entries (19%)

Note: MED% higher because most behavior issues are adjustment-level, not strategy-level

HIGH-VOI Entries (ask first):
- Q3: Critical failure - cannot miss
- Q4: Goal failure - must maintain
- Q5: Few/None consistent - behavior problem
- Q6: Critical actions inconsistent - priority fix
- Q7: Lack of motivation / Unknown blocker - fix incentives
