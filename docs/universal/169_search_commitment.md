**Source**: Decision theory, commitment devices, option value
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Core Insight

**Search is not decision. Finding is not committing.**

Commitment is distinct from finding a good candidate:
- **Search** identifies options
- **Evaluation** ranks options
- **Commitment** binds you to one

Premature commitment closes off learning. Delayed commitment loses opportunities. The question is not just "what's best?" but "when to stop exploring and start exploiting?"

## Q1: What's the cost of keeping options open?

[VOI: HIGH - option value assessment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Low cost to keep open | HIGH | Delay commitment, keep learning | Preserve flexibility | Miss action benefits |
| High cost to keep open | HIGH | Commit sooner | Capture value | Commit to wrong option |
| Options expiring | HIGH | Commit before expiration | Secure option | Rush decision |

## Q3: What's the confidence level required?

[VOI: HIGH - commitment threshold]

| Low confidence acceptable | MED | Commit earlier | Fast iteration | Commit to bad options |
| Confidence undefined | HIGH | Define threshold first | Clear criterion | Perpetual uncertainty |

---

## Q4: Are you committing to explore or exploit?

[VOI: HIGH - exploration vs exploitation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Commit to explore more | MED | Investment in learning | Better future decisions | Delay value capture |
| Commit to exploit best known | HIGH | Capture current value | Realize gains | Miss better option |
| Mixed strategy | MED | Allocate to both | Balance | Suboptimal allocation |

---

## Q5: Does commitment enable resources you don't have?

[VOI: HIGH - commitment unlocks resources]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, commitment unlocks resources | HIGH | Commit to get resources | Leverage commitment | Lose without commitment |
| No, resources independent | LOW | Commitment only about decision | Simpler analysis | Miss leverage |

---

## Q6: What's the commitment signal to others?

[VOI: MED - social/strategic dimension]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Signal matters (credibility, coordination) | MED | Consider signaling value | Strategic commitment | Miss signaling opportunity |
| Signal doesn't matter | LOW | Pure decision analysis | Simpler | Miss strategic value |

---

## Q7: Can you commit partially or sequentially?

[VOI: MED - commitment granularity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, staged commitment possible | MED | Commit in stages | Learn while committing | Over-delay |
| No, all-or-nothing | MED | Single decision point | Clean commitment | Forced binary |

---

## Q8: What does not committing cost?

[VOI: MED - opportunity cost of waiting]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High opportunity cost | MED | Commit sooner | Capture opportunities | Commit poorly |
| Low opportunity cost | LOW | Can wait | More information | Miss timing |

---

## Q9: Is there pressure to commit that isn't about the decision?

[VOI: MED - pressure detection]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, external pressure | MED | Evaluate pressure source | May need to resist | Cave to bad pressure |
| Yes, internal pressure (discomfort) | MED | Separate discomfort from decision | Commit when right, not when uncomfortable | Premature commitment |
| No pressure | LOW | Decide on merits | Clean decision | Miss urgency |

---

## Q10: What commitment device is appropriate?

[VOI: LOW - implementation of commitment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Public commitment | LOW | Announce to make binding | Social accountability | Can't back out of mistake |
| Contractual | LOW | Formal agreement | Legal binding | Inflexibility |
| Investment | LOW | Spend resources to make real | Skin in game | Sunk cost trap |
| None needed | LOW | Simple decision | Low stakes | Miss commitment value |

4. Q4: Committing to explore or exploit?
5. Q5: Does commitment enable resources?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: What's the commitment signal?
7. Q7: Can you commit partially?
8. Q8: What does not committing cost?
9. Q9: Is there pressure not about the decision?

## Commitment Timing Framework

| Factor | Suggests Commit | Suggests Wait |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Reversibility | Easily reversible | Irreversible |
| Information | Not much more to learn | More learning possible |
| Options | Options expiring | Options stable |
| Resources | Commitment unlocks resources | Resources available either way |
| Cost of waiting | High opportunity cost | Low opportunity cost |
| Confidence | Threshold reached | Below threshold |

---

## Explore vs Exploit Heuristics

**Explore more when:**
- Early in process
- High uncertainty
- Learning is cheap
- Best option not much better than alternatives
- Long time horizon

**Exploit more when:**
- Late in process
- Low uncertainty
- Learning is expensive
- Clear best option
- Short time horizon

---

## Commitment Levels

| Level | Description | When Appropriate |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Soft preference** | Leaning toward X, open to change | Early, high uncertainty |
| **Working decision** | Acting on X, monitoring for disconfirmation | Mid-process, moderate confidence |
| **Firm commitment** | X is chosen, stop considering alternatives | High confidence, decision made |
| **Locked commitment** | X is chosen, cannot change | Irreversible, resources invested |

---

## Common Commitment Errors

| Error | Pattern | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Analysis paralysis** | Never confident enough to commit | Set explicit threshold, deadline |
| **Premature commitment** | Commit before adequate search | Set minimum exploration |
| **Commitment escalation** | Increase commitment to failing option | Regular reassessment |
| **Pseudo-commitment** | Claim committed but keep shopping | True commitment or honest exploration |
| **Pressure-driven commitment** | Commit because uncomfortable | Separate discomfort from decision |
| **Commitment avoidance** | Avoid commitment to avoid responsibility | Accept that not committing is also a choice |

---

## The Commitment Paradox

- Commitment enables focused action
- But commitment closes off alternatives
- Therefore: commitment is costly

Resolution: Commit to the **level** appropriate for the stakes:
- Low stakes → Light commitment, easy revision
- High stakes → Heavy commitment, thorough search first
- Irreversible → Maximum confidence before commitment
