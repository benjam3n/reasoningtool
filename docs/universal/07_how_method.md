## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Reversibility) - one-way door check
2. **Q2** (Alternatives exist?) - is this the right method
3. **Q3** (Method appropriate?) - fitness check
4. **Q4** (Success criteria) - know when done
5. **Q5** (Failure modes) - risk assessment
6. **Q6** (Complexity) - can we plan or must iterate?
7. **Q7-Q8** (Skills, resources) - do we have what's needed?
8. **Q9** (Specified?) - validate assumptions
9. **Q10-Q12** (Category, time, precedent) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is this method irreversible?" routes to extensive analysis vs quick iteration. "Are resources unavailable?" routes to method change vs proceeding.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
