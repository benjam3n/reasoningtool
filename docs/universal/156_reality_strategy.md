# Universal: Reality Strategy (156)

**Category**: SEARCH - What Determines Whether Something Is Considered Possible?
**Source**: Dilts "Beliefs: Pathways to Health" - Reality vs Imagined
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**The same neural structures represent both remembered and imagined experience. A strategy is needed to distinguish them.**

Possibilities only enter the action space if they pass a "reality test." This test is based on qualities of representation (clarity, location, brightness, feeling).

Different people have different tests. What passes one person's test fails another's.

## Q1: What criteria distinguish "possible" from "fantasy"?

[VOI: HIGH - unknown criteria = unreliable evaluation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Criteria unknown | HIGH | Cannot reliably evaluate | Identify criteria | Accept fantasy or reject possible |
| Criteria known | LOW | Can evaluate systematically | Apply criteria | Wrong criteria being used |

---

## Q2: Does this possibility pass the test?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether action follows]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Passes (coded as possible) | LOW | Action may follow | Consider acting | Actually coded as fantasy |
| Fails (coded as fantasy) | HIGH | No action follows | Recode if should be possible | Dismiss valid possibility |

---

## Q3: Is the test too strict?

[VOI: HIGH - over-filtering removes valid possibilities]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too strict | HIGH | Valid possibilities filtered out | Loosen test | Continue missing options |
| Not too strict | LOW | Appropriate filtering | Continue | Actually over-filtering |

---

## Q4: Is the test too loose?

[VOI: HIGH - under-filtering accepts invalid possibilities]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too loose | HIGH | Invalid possibilities accepted | Tighten test | Waste effort on impossible |
| Not too loose | LOW | Appropriate filtering | Continue | Actually under-filtering |

---

## Q5: What qualities mark "possible"?

[VOI: MED - mechanism of the test]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Visual (clarity, location, brightness) | MED | Visual test | Use visual criteria | Miss other modalities |
| Kinesthetic (feelings of certainty) | MED | Feeling test | Use feeling criteria | Miss other modalities |
| Auditory (voice qualities) | MED | Auditory test | Use auditory criteria | Miss other modalities |
| Unknown qualities | MED | Cannot test reliably | Identify qualities | Test unreliably |

---

## Q6: Can a possibility be recoded?

[VOI: MED - ability to change classification]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes | MED | Can expand action space | Recode as needed | Stay limited |
| No | MED | Limited to current classification | Work within limits | Miss recoding option |

---

## Q7: Is the test serving its purpose?

[VOI: MED - calibration check]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Serving well | LOW | Appropriate test | Continue | Actually miscalibrated |
| Not serving well | MED | Needs adjustment | Recalibrate | Continue with broken test |

---

## Q8: What has been misclassified?

[VOI: LOW - cleanup]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Valid possibilities rejected | LOW | Resources missed | Reclassify | Continue missing |
| Invalid possibilities accepted | LOW | False basis operating | Reclassify | Continue on false basis |
| No misclassification | LOW | Clean system | Continue | Actually has errors |

---

## Q9: How is the test applied?

[VOI: LOW - process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| External verification | LOW | Check against world | Continue | Over-rely on internal |
| Internal comparison | LOW | Compare representations | Continue | Over-rely on external |

---

## Q10: Can the test be updated?

[VOI: LOW - meta-capability]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes | LOW | Can improve | Update when needed | Stuck with current |
| No | LOW | Fixed | Accept limitation | Miss update option |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: What criteria distinguish possible from fantasy?
2. Q2: Does this possibility pass the test?
3. Q3: Is the test too strict?
4. Q4: Is the test too loose?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: What qualities mark "possible"?
6. Q6: Can a possibility be recoded?
7. Q7: Is the test serving its purpose?

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: What has been misclassified?
9. Q9: How is the test applied?
10. Q10: Can the test be updated?

## Key Insight

**The test**:
1. Think of something you DID yesterday
2. Think of something you COULD HAVE done but didn't
3. Notice the difference in qualities (location, clarity, brightness, feeling)
4. That difference IS the reality test

## Implications

| If The Test | Then |
|-------------|------|
| Is too strict | Valid possibilities are filtered out |
| Is too loose | Invalid possibilities waste effort |
| Uses wrong modality | Programming in that modality won't stick |
| Is unknown | Behavior is inconsistent |

**The question**: Is the answer being filtered out because it doesn't pass the reality test?
