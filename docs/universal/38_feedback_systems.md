## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: What feedback exists? (do we have visibility?)
2. Q3: How accurate is feedback? (can we trust it?)
3. Q2: What is delay between action and feedback? (learning speed)
4. Q8: Is there a learning process? (do we learn?)
5. Q10: Are lessons applied? (do we act on learnings?)
6. Q9: How are lessons captured? (do we retain learnings?)
7. Q7: What triggers action change? (do we respond to feedback?)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
8. Q4: What is feedback missing? (blind spots)
9. Q6: How could missing feedback be created? (filling gaps)
10. Q5: What feedback would be valuable? (improvements)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is feedback accurate?" is HIGH VOI because INACCURATE → fix or replace the feedback system, ACCURATE → trust and act on it. These are fundamentally different responses.

Feedback systems determine whether you learn and adapt or repeat mistakes.
