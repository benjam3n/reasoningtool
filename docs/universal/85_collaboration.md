## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Is there a shared understanding of the goal?

## Q5: Is there trust between collaborators?
[VOI: HIGH - low trust means defensive and political vs high trust enables openness]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Low trust | HIGH | Build trust first vs expect collaboration | Build trust first | Expect collaboration, get competition |
| Unknown trust level | MED | Trust assessment vs proceed | Trust assessment | CYA behaviors surprise you |
| High trust | LOW | Open and vulnerable, maintain | Maintain | Surface trust, hidden protection |

---

## Q6: Are there unresolved conflicts between collaborators?
[VOI: HIGH - conflicts exist means friction and avoidance vs no conflicts enables clean collaboration]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conflicts exist | HIGH | Resolve conflicts vs accept dysfunction | Resolve conflicts | Wonder why collaboration is "slow" |
| Unknown if conflicts | MED | Conflict check vs proceed | Conflict check | Politeness hiding dysfunction |
| No conflicts | LOW | Clean collaboration, proceed | Proceed | Underground conflicts surface at worst time |

---

## Q7: Is the coordination overhead appropriate for the task?
[VOI: HIGH - too little coordination creates chaos and rework vs appropriate enables efficiency]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too little coordination | HIGH | Increase coordination vs accept chaos | Increase | Efficiency creates rework, net negative |
| Too much coordination | MED | Reduce vs accept bureaucracy | Reduce | Efficient coordination mistaken for insufficient |
| Unknown if appropriate | MED | Overhead assessment vs proceed | Overhead assessment | Accept dysfunction as "how it is" |
| Appropriate overhead | LOW | Balanced, maintain | Maintain | Death by meetings or chaos by absence |

---

## Q8: Does everyone have visibility into relevant progress?
[VOI: HIGH - opaque progress means surprises and duplication vs visible enables coordination]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, opaque | HIGH | Make visible vs accept surprises | Make visible | Duplicate work, miss conflicts |
| Unknown visibility | MED | Visibility check vs proceed | Visibility check | Integration surprises |
| Yes, visible | LOW | Coordinated, maintain | Maintain | Think visible, actually operating blind |

---

## Q9: Is there accountability for collaborative commitments?
[VOI: HIGH - no accountability means unreliable commitments vs accountability enables planning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No accountability | HIGH | Add accountability vs plan on unreliable | Add accountability | Plan on commitments that won't be kept |
| Unknown accountability | MED | Accountability check vs proceed | Accountability check | Surprised by missed commitments |
| Yes, accountability exists | LOW | Commitments kept, maintain | Maintain | Think accountable, actually optional |

---

## Q10: Are there mechanisms for raising and resolving issues?
[VOI: HIGH - no mechanisms means issues fester vs mechanisms enable early resolution]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No mechanisms | HIGH | Create mechanisms vs accept festering | Create mechanisms | Small problems become crises |
| Unknown if mechanisms | MED | Mechanism check vs proceed | Mechanism check | Surprised by "sudden" problems |
| Yes, mechanisms exist | LOW | Issues surface early, maintain | Maintain | Think issues raised, actually suppressed |

---

## Q11: Are decisions being made at the right level?
[VOI: MED - wrong level causes delays or inconsistencies but can be adjusted]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Decisions too centralized | MED | Delegate vs accept bottleneck | Delegate | Think delegated, center still bottleneck |
| Decisions too distributed | MED | Consolidate vs accept fragmentation | Consolidate | Think coordinated, actually fragmented |
| Unknown decision level | MED | Decision level check vs proceed | Decision level check | Accept inefficiency as inherent |
| Right level | LOW | Efficient and coherent, maintain | Maintain | Wrong level causes delays or conflicts |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Shared goal? Clear roles? - foundation
- Q5-Q6: Trust? Conflicts? - relationship health
- Q4, Q8: Communication? Visibility? - information flow
- Q3, Q7, Q9-Q10: Dependencies, overhead, accountability, mechanisms

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q11: Decision level - optimization within collaboration

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ collaboration quality importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (align goals vs proceed fragmented, build trust vs expect collaboration, create mechanisms vs accept festering). Low VOI questions optimize within an established collaborative framework.
