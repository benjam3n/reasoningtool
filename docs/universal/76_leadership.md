## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
1. Q1 (Vision?) - direction exists
2. Q2 (Known?) - direction communicated
3. Q3 (Shared?) - understood same way
4. Q4 (Aligned?) - efforts directed
5. Q5 (Authority?) - can decide
6. Q6 (Resources?) - can execute
7. Q7 (Ownership?) - accountability clear
8. Q8 (Single owner?) - accountability focused
9. Q9 (Trust competence?) - will follow
10. Q10 (Trust intentions?) - will believe
11. Q11 (Trust consistency?) - will depend

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
(All questions above have HIGH VOI variants - MED entries are "unknown" states requiring investigation)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ leadership importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

Q9 "Do people trust the leader's competence?" is HIGH VOI because:
- TRUSTED → people follow willingly
- DOUBTED → must demonstrate competence before leading (completely different work)

All leadership questions have HIGH VOI for their negative state because leadership without trust, vision, resources, or accountability simply doesn't work - it requires completely different intervention.
