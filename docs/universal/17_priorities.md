# Universal: Priorities (17)

**Category**: STRATEGY - Priorities/Ranking
**Source**: [D: CORE DIMENSIONS - Priorities (what matters most)]
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths (like phone tree routing to different departments)
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Are priorities defined?
[VOI: HIGH - not defined → must define before proceeding; defined → follow them; completely different paths]

| Yes, clearly defined | LOW | Follow priorities | Follow priorities | Priorities unclear |

---

## Q2: Are stakeholders aligned on priorities?
[VOI: HIGH - not aligned → resolve conflict first; aligned → proceed; different paths]

---

## Q3: How stable are priorities?
[VOI: HIGH - unstable → adaptive approach; stable → plan confidently; different approaches]

---

## Q4: Is there a clear top priority?

---

## Q5: What criteria determine priorities?
[VOI: HIGH - unknown criteria → can't rank; known criteria → apply them]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown criteria | HIGH | Define criteria first | Define criteria first | Criteria known |
| Urgency (time-driven) | MED | Time-based ranking | Order by urgency | Different criteria |

| Dependencies (sequence-driven) | MED | Dependency-based | Order by dependencies | Different criteria |
| Risk (risk-driven) | MED | Risk-based ranking | Order by risk | Different criteria |
| Multiple criteria | MED | Weight and combine | Weight and combine | Single criterion |
| Effort (ease-driven) | LOW | Effort-based ranking | Order by effort | Different criteria |

---

## Q6: Who defines priorities?
[VOI: HIGH for conflict situations → reconcile; MED for clear authority]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Multiple authorities | HIGH | Reconcile vs follow | Reconcile priorities | Single authority |
| No one defines | HIGH | Define authority first | Someone must define | Authority exists |
| You define | MED | Self-direction | Set your priorities | Others define |
| Stakeholder defines | MED | Follow authority | Follow their priorities | Different authority |
| Unknown authority | MED | Clarify first | Authority discovery | Authority known |

---

## Q7: What is deprioritized?
[VOI: HIGH for "nothing deprioritized" → force prioritization; otherwise MED/LOW]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Nothing deprioritized | HIGH | Force prioritization | Force prioritization | Some deprioritized |
| Implicit deprioritization | MED | Make explicit | Make explicit | Explicit |
| Unknown what's low | MED | Clarify | Low priority discovery | Low priority known |
| Clear list of lower priority | LOW | Skip low priority | Skip low priority | List unclear |

---

## Q8: Are priorities communicated?
[VOI: HIGH for not communicated → surface and communicate; MED otherwise]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not communicated | HIGH | Surface and communicate | Surface and communicate | Communicated |
| Partially communicated | MED | Clarify communication | Clarify communication | Clear or unclear |
| Unknown communication | LOW | Check | Communication check | Communication known |
| Clearly communicated | LOW | Follow | Follow communicated | Unclear |

---

## Q9: What determines when priorities change?
[VOI: MED - affects planning style but not fundamental approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Event-based trigger | MED | Monitor events | Monitor events | Time-based |
| Authority decision | MED | Watch for decisions | Watch for decisions | Other trigger |
| Unknown trigger | MED | Determine trigger | Trigger discovery | Trigger known |
| Time-based review | LOW | Follow schedule | Follow schedule | Event-based |
| Completion-based | LOW | Follow sequence | Follow sequence | Different trigger |

---

## Q10: What happens to deprioritized items?
[VOI: MED - affects handling but same general approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Done by others | MED | Coordinate handoff | Coordinate handoff | Done by you |
| Never done | MED | Accept abandonment | Accept abandonment | Eventually done |
| Done later | LOW | Track for later | Track for later | Never done |
| Unknown handling | LOW | Decide later | Handling decision | Handling known |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

1. **Q1: Defined** (HIGH) - Do priorities exist at all
2. **Q2: Alignment** (HIGH) - Stakeholder conflict check
3. **Q4: Top priority** (HIGH) - Is there focus
4. **Q5: Criteria** (HIGH for unknown) - How to rank
5. **Q6: Authority** (HIGH for conflict) - Who decides
6. **Q3: Stability** (HIGH for unstable) - Will they change
7. **Q7: Deprioritized** (HIGH for nothing) - What's skipped
8. **Q8: Communicated** (HIGH for not) - Hidden priorities
9. **Q9-Q10: Triggers, Handling** (MED/LOW) - Details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**
**VOI = Action Divergence**

A priority being "important" doesn't make the question HIGH-VOI. The question is: does knowing the answer change what you DO?

- "Not defined" is HIGH-VOI because you must define before proceeding
- "Clear top priority" is LOW-VOI because you simply follow it
- "What triggers change" is MED-VOI because the approach (monitor) stays similar
