## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Higher abstraction levels control lower levels, not the reverse.**

Meta-feelings (feelings about feelings) determine how base feelings are interpreted. "I feel anxious about feeling attracted" → the meta-level (anxious) frames and constrains the base level (attracted). The further removed from base sensation, the more influential.

This applies to:
- Emotions about emotions
- Beliefs about beliefs
- Values about values
- Frames about frames
- Questions about questions

**The microscope analogy**: Physical reality is at the bottom. Each lens (meta-level) between you and it modifies perception. A speck on the lens closest to your eye (highest abstraction) dominates despite being "smaller" than the object.

## Q1: Are we targeting the controlling level?

[VOI: HIGH - targeting wrong level = influence doesn't propagate]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Targeting base when meta controls | HIGH | Influence fails | Move up hierarchy | Change facts, unchanged perception |
| Unknown which level controls | MED | May be wasting effort | Hierarchy analysis | Either base or meta |
| Targeting controlling level | LOW | Influence propagates | Continue | Actually wrong level |

---

## Q2: How deep is the abstraction chain here?

[VOI: HIGH - shallow vs deep chains need different approaches]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Deep chain (many meta-levels) | HIGH | Must traverse up | Work up the chain | Target shallow, get nowhere |
| Unknown chain depth | MED | May be mismatching | Chain depth analysis | Either shallow or deep |
| Shallow chain (few levels) | MED | Direct action works | Target directly | Overthink simple situation |

---

## Q3: Can we create a new meta-level?

[VOI: HIGH - new meta-level can reframe everything below it]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can create meta-level but haven't | HIGH | Missed control point | Create higher frame | Fight at lower levels unnecessarily |
| Unknown if can create | MED | May be missing opportunity | Meta-creation test | Either create or fight below |
| Cannot create meta-level | LOW | Work within existing | Optimize at current level | Miss meta-creation opportunity |

---

## Q4: What's the current top of the hierarchy?

[VOI: HIGH - the top controls everything below]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Top level unknown | HIGH | Can't target control point | Identify top level | Optimize middle, miss top |
| Identity/values at top | MED | Very stable/hard to change | Work with identity | Against identity = fail |
| Beliefs at top | MED | Changeable with evidence | Present evidence | Wrong intervention type |
| Emotions at top | MED | Changeable with experience | Create experience | Wrong intervention type |

---

## Q5: Is the hierarchy stable or cascading?

[VOI: MED - stable hierarchies need different approach than cascading ones]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Actively cascading | MED | Can ride the cascade | Amplify cascade direction | Miss cascade window |
| Unknown stability | MED | May have momentum | Stability check | Either stable or moving |
| Stable hierarchy | LOW | Must initiate change | Create perturbation | Fight stable system |

---

## Q6: Are there competing meta-levels?

[VOI: MED - conflict at meta-level creates paralysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Competing meta-levels | MED | Resolve conflict first | Align or choose | Action blocked by conflict |
| Unknown if competing | MED | May have hidden conflict | Conflict check | Either clean or blocked |
| Aligned meta-levels | LOW | Clear action path | Execute | Actually conflicting |

---

## Q7: Is X → X+1 possible here?

[VOI: MED - any level can intensify if malleable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Level is malleable | MED | Can amplify | Intensify current level | Miss amplification |
| Unknown malleability | MED | May be changeable | Malleability test | Either fixed or fluid |
| Level is fixed | LOW | Must work around | Accept and adapt | Fight unchangeable |

---

## Q8: Does the receiver know their own hierarchy?

[VOI: LOW - awareness affects approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Hierarchy unconscious | LOW | Can't reason about it | Work implicit | Explicit fails |
| Unknown awareness | LOW | May need to surface | Awareness check | Either implicit or explicit |
| Hierarchy conscious | LOW | Can reason about it | Work explicit | Implicit when could discuss |

---

## Q9: Is this a recursive hierarchy?

[VOI: LOW - recursion affects modeling but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Self-referential levels | LOW | Potential loops | Watch for loops | Get caught in recursion |
| Unknown if recursive | LOW | May have loops | Recursion check | Either linear or looping |
| Linear hierarchy | LOW | No loops | Direct traversal | Miss recursion |

---

## Q10: What's the natural direction of influence?

[VOI: LOW - direction affects framing but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Top-down (meta→base) | LOW | Control flows down | Work at meta | Fight flow direction |
| Bottom-up (base→meta) | LOW | Build from base | Create base experiences | Skip foundation |
| Bidirectional | LOW | Can work either way | Choose strategic point | Miss flexibility |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Targeting controlling level? - propagation
2. Q2: Chain depth? - approach type
3. Q3: Can create meta-level? - reframe opportunity
4. Q4: What's at top? - control point

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Stable or cascading? - momentum
6. Q6: Competing meta-levels? - conflict
7. Q7: X → X+1 possible? - amplification

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Receiver aware? - implicit vs explicit
9. Q9: Recursive? - loop risk
10. Q10: Natural direction? - flow

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth about abstraction. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is this a recursive hierarchy?" is analytically interesting but has LOW VOI - you handle it similarly either way.

"Are we targeting the controlling level?" has HIGH VOI - wrong level means influence doesn't propagate no matter how good your execution.

## The Cascade Principle

From Fuentes: Emotions cascade. X → Y → Z, where:
- Z is more abstract than Y
- Z is more abstract than X
- **Z controls how Y and X are interpreted**

Example: "The sun feels warm" (base sensation) → "This makes me feel alive" (meta-1) → "I'm meant to experience this" (meta-2: destiny)

The "destiny" interpretation at meta-2 frames everything below it. Change the meta-2 level and the entire experience changes, even though the sun's warmth is identical.

**The trap:** Fighting at the base level when meta-level controls interpretation.

**The move:** Before trying to change something, ask "What level actually controls this?" Then work at that level or above it.

**The power of "more":** Any X can become X+1 through language. "Passion" → "Deeper passion" → "True passion." The labels are arbitrary but the intensification is real.
