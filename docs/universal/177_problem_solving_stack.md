# Universal: The Problem-Solving Stack (177)

**Structure**: 7-layer stack with failure distribution

## Core Insight

**Most problem-solving fails not at solving, but at noticing and framing.**

65% of failures happen before you even start generating solutions:
- 40% at Noticing (wrong problem)
- 25% at Framing (wrong representation)

The conventional approach (define → generate → evaluate → decide) skips the most critical layers.

## Layer 0: META-RESPONSE

**Question**: Should I SOLVE this, or respond differently?

Before solving, consider alternatives:

| Response | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **SOLVE** | Problem is real, solvable, worth solving |
| **DISSOLVE** | Reframe and problem disappears |
| **ACCEPT** | Costs of solving exceed costs of living with it |
| **TRANSFORM** | Redirect energy to opportunity instead |
| **PREVENT** | Address upstream cause, not symptom |
| **WAIT** | Time/circumstances will change things |

**Key insight**: Many "problems" shouldn't be solved at all.

---

## Layer 1: NOTICING (40% of failures)

**Question**: What is ACTUALLY happening?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| What do I observe vs infer? | Separate data from interpretation |
| What problem am I REALLY solving? | Stated ≠ actual |
| What am I not seeing? | Blind spots exist |
| Is this cause or symptom? | Symptoms recur if cause ignored |
| Who sees this differently? | Multiple perspectives reveal truth |

**Failure mode**: Solving the wrong problem entirely.

---

## Layer 2: FRAMING (25% of failures)

**Question**: How should I REPRESENT this problem?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| What frame am I using? | Frames constrain solutions |
| What constraints am I assuming? | Many aren't real |
| How would someone else frame this? | Different frames reveal options |
| What frame opens most options? | Some frames are generative |
| What would opposite frame reveal? | Inversion uncovers blind spots |

**Rule**: Try at least 3 frames before committing to one.

**Failure mode**: Right problem, wrong representation.

---

## Layer 3: GENERATING

**Question**: What OPTIONS exist?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| What are the obvious solutions? | Start with what's known |
| What are the non-obvious solutions? | Obvious isn't always best |
| What would a different person try? | Perspective generates options |
| What's the opposite of obvious? | Inversion reveals hidden options |
| What's missing from my list? | Gaps are invisible until sought |

**Failure mode**: First idea accepted without exploration.

---

## Layer 4: EVALUATING

**Question**: Which options are VIABLE and GOOD?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| What criteria matter? | Make ranking explicit |
| Which options are actually feasible? | Some aren't |
| What are the trade-offs? | Every option has costs |
| Am I fooling myself about any option? | Self-deception is common |
| What would failure look like for each? | Pre-mortem reveals risk |

**Failure mode**: Optimistic evaluation without honest assessment.

---

## Layer 5: COMMITTING

**Question**: What should I DO?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Is more search warranted? | Sometimes yes |
| What's the cost of being wrong? | Determines commitment level |
| What commitment level is appropriate? | Full commit vs experiment |
| What would change my mind? | Know your exit conditions |
| When will I reassess? | Build in review points |

**Failure mode**: Analysis paralysis OR premature commitment.

---

## Layer 6: EXECUTING

**Question**: How is this WORKING?

| Ask | Why |
|-----|-----|
| What's actually happening? | Return to Noticing |
| Is it working as expected? | Reality vs plan |
| What am I learning? | Every execution teaches |
| Should I persist, pivot, or stop? | Three valid responses |
| Do I need earlier layer? | Stack is iterative |

**Failure mode**: Good solution poorly implemented.

| 3: Generating | Execution | 168, 167 |
| 4: Evaluating | Execution | 164 |

## Minimal Version (1-Page)

```
THE PROBLEM-SOLVING STACK (Minimal)
===================================

0. META: Should I solve this?
   → Options: Solve, Dissolve, Accept, Transform, Prevent, Wait

1. NOTICE: What's actually happening? [40% fail here]
   → Observe vs infer, cause vs symptom

2. FRAME: How should I represent this? [25% fail here]
   → Try 3+ frames before committing

3. GENERATE: What options exist?
   → Obvious + non-obvious + opposite

4. EVALUATE: Which are viable and good?
   → Explicit criteria, honest assessment

5. COMMIT: What should I do?
   → Match commitment to reversibility

6. EXECUTE: How is this working?
   → Reality check, learn, iterate
```

## When to Use This

**HIGH value when**:
- Feeling stuck on a problem
- Solution attempts keep failing
- Unsure if solving is even right approach
- Want systematic coverage of problem-solving

**Check specific layer when**:
- Keep solving wrong problem → Layer 1
- Solutions feel constrained → Layer 2
- Only see one option → Layer 3
- Can't choose between options → Layer 4
- Can't decide → Layer 5
- Solution isn't working → Layer 6

---

## Key Insight Summary

1. **Layer 0 is real**: Not-solving is a legitimate response
2. **65% of failures are early**: Noticing + Framing are where problems fail
3. **Frames constrain**: Wrong frame = constrained solution space
4. **Stack is iterative**: Any layer can return to earlier layers
5. **Attention > Method**: The quality of noticing matters more than technique
