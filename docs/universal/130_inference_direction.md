## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are we reasoning forward (evidence→conclusion) or backward (conclusion→evidence)?

[VOI: HIGH - direction determines what you find and how you find it]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Forward when should be backward | HIGH | Missing the target | Switch to backward | Wander without destination |
| Backward when should be forward | HIGH | Confirmation bias risk | Switch to forward | Find only what confirms |
| Unknown direction | MED | May be inefficient | Direction check | Either wander or confirm |
| Direction appropriate | LOW | On track | Continue | Actually wrong direction |

---

## Q2: Do we have a target conclusion or are we exploring?

[VOI: HIGH - exploration vs validation require opposite strategies]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Have target, treating as exploration | HIGH | Inefficient search | Target-back reasoning | Explore when should converge |
| Exploring, treating as validation | HIGH | Premature closure | Open exploration | Close when should explore |
| Unknown mode | MED | May mismatch | Mode clarification | Either close or wander |
| Mode matches task | LOW | Appropriate | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q3: Is backward reasoning causing confirmation bias?

[VOI: HIGH - confirmation bias finds only supporting evidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Confirmation bias active | HIGH | Only seeing support | Seek disconfirmation | False confidence |
| Unknown if biased | MED | May be biased | Bias check | Either biased or paranoid |
| Genuinely open search | LOW | Finding all evidence | Continue | Actually biased |

---

## Q4: Is forward reasoning missing the relevant evidence?

[VOI: HIGH - undirected search may never find target]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Forward search missing relevant | HIGH | Wandering | Add backward constraints | Continue missing |
| Unknown if missing | MED | May be incomplete | Coverage check | Either incomplete or sufficient |
| Forward finding relevant | LOW | On track | Continue | Actually missing key evidence |

---

## Q5: Should we use bidirectional reasoning?

[VOI: HIGH - bidirectional often best but more complex]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Bidirectional needed | HIGH | Need both directions | Implement both | Miss from one direction |
| Unknown if bidirectional | MED | May be incomplete | Strategy analysis | Either overkill or incomplete |
| Single direction sufficient | LOW | Simpler approach | Continue single | Miss bidirectional need |

---

## Q6: Is the starting point well-established?

[VOI: MED - affects foundation but similar reasoning process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Starting point shaky | MED | Foundation weak | Strengthen foundation | Build on sand |
| Unknown foundation quality | MED | May be building on sand | Foundation check | Either weak or strong |
| Starting point solid | LOW | Can build | Build confidently | Foundation weaker than thought |

---

## Q7: Is the target conclusion well-defined?

[VOI: MED - affects backward reasoning but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Target vague | MED | Hard to reason backward | Define target first | Backward to vague target |
| Unknown if defined | MED | May be reasoning to fog | Definition check | Either clear or foggy |
| Target well-defined | LOW | Can reason backward | Use target | Actually vague |

---

## Q8: Are we confusing inference direction with causation direction?

[VOI: MED - affects reasoning validity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Confusing inference/causation | MED | Invalid reasoning | Separate directions | Draw wrong conclusions |
| Unknown if confused | MED | May be invalid | Direction analysis | Either invalid or valid |
| Directions clear | LOW | Valid reasoning | Continue | Actually confused |

---

## Q9: Can we invert the problem?

[VOI: LOW - affects approach but similar reasoning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inversion helpful | LOW | Alternative approach | Try inverted problem | Miss easier path |
| Unknown if helpful | LOW | May miss efficiency | Inversion test | Either waste or miss |
| Inversion not helpful | LOW | Original approach | Continue original | Actually helpful |

---

## Q10: Is there a meet-in-the-middle opportunity?

[VOI: LOW - affects efficiency but similar outcome]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Meet-in-middle possible | LOW | Efficiency gain | Use bidirectional | Miss efficiency |
| Unknown if possible | LOW | May miss efficiency | Middle analysis | Either waste or miss |
| Not possible | LOW | Single direction | Continue single | Miss opportunity |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Forward or backward? - direction choice
2. Q2: Target or exploring? - mode match
3. Q3: Confirmation bias? - backward pathology
4. Q4: Missing relevant? - forward pathology
5. Q5: Bidirectional needed? - strategy

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Starting point solid? - foundation
7. Q7: Target defined? - backward anchor
8. Q8: Inference vs causation? - validity

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Invert problem? - alternative
10. Q10: Meet in middle? - efficiency

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ logical sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Can we invert the problem?" is clever but has LOW VOI - you try it and see.

"Are we reasoning forward when we should be backward?" has HIGH VOI - wrong direction means wandering or confirming.

## The Two Directions

**Forward reasoning** (data-driven, bottom-up):
- Start with evidence, build toward conclusions
- Good for: exploration, discovery, avoiding bias
- Risk: may never reach relevant conclusions

**Backward reasoning** (goal-driven, top-down):
- Start with target, find supporting/refuting evidence
- Good for: efficiency, relevance, verification
- Risk: confirmation bias, motivated reasoning

The meta-insight: Most people default to one direction. Explicitly choosing direction based on the task prevents both wandering and confirming.

Best practice: Start forward to avoid bias, then use backward to check completeness.
