## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

| Nothing (low stakes) | MED | Failure is acceptable | Can take risks | Stakes exist |
| Unknown consequences | MED | Assessment needed | Consequence analysis | Consequences known |
| Retry possible | LOW | Second chance | Plan for iteration | No retry |

---

## Q7: Can success criteria change?
[VOI: HIGH - will change = moving target]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will change (expected) | HIGH | Moving target | Build adaptability | Target stable |
| May change (flexible) | MED | Adapt as needed | Monitor for changes | Fixed |
| Unknown stability | MED | Monitoring needed | Stability monitoring | Stability known |
| Fixed (won't change) | MED | Stable target | Plan to fixed | Criteria will change |

---

## Q8: What partial success looks like?
[VOI: HIGH - binary (no partial) = all-or-nothing]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Partial success is binary (no partial) | HIGH | All-or-nothing | Must fully succeed | Partial exists |
| Partial success varies by dimension | MED | Multi-dimensional | Track each dimension | Single dimension |
| Unknown partial success | MED | Definition needed | Define partial | Partial known |
| Partial success is defined | LOW | Increments clear | Track increments | Partial unclear |

---

## Q9: When will success be evaluated?
[VOI: HIGH - after delay = delayed feedback]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| After delay (lagging indicator) | HIGH | Delayed feedback | Wait for evaluation | Immediate feedback |
| At milestones | MED | Progress checks | Check at milestones | Other timing |
| Continuously | MED | Real-time tracking | Track continuously | Point-in-time |
| Unknown timing | LOW | Can determine | Timing discovery | Timing known |
| At completion | LOW | Final check | Evaluate at end | Ongoing evaluation |

---

## Q10: What type of success criteria?
[VOI: MED - measurement approach, same goal]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Qualitative (subjective) | MED | Judgment required | Establish rubric | Quantitative |
| Gradient (degrees of success) | MED | Nuanced assessment | Define levels | Binary |
| Comparative (vs benchmark) | MED | Need benchmark | Establish benchmark | Absolute |
| Unknown type | MED | Type discovery | Determine type | Type known |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Are criteria defined?) - fundamental
2. **Q2** (How measured?) - verification
3. **Q3** (Who defines?) - authority
4. **Q4** (Alignment) - conflict check
5. **Q5** (Minimum) - floor
6. **Q6** (Retry possible?) - stakes
7. **Q7** (Can change?) - stability
8. **Q8** (Partial success?) - all-or-nothing check
9. **Q9-Q11** (Timing, type, ideal) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Are success criteria defined?" routes to definition work vs proceeding. "Is there no retry?" routes to maximum safeguards vs iteration.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
