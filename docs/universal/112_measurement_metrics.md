## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown who measures | MED | Assign responsibility vs. unclear | Accountability gap | No one measures |

## Q7: Is the metric gaming-resistant?

[VOI: HIGH - gameable metric becomes meaningless]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Easily gamed | HIGH | Different metric vs. use | Goodhart's Law risk | Metric becomes meaningless |
| Unknown gamability | MED | Assess gaming risk vs. trust | May be gamed | Gamed without knowing |
| Partially gameable | MED | Monitor for gaming vs. trust | Needs monitoring | Gaming happens undetected |
| Ungameable | LOW | Trust metric vs. monitor | Reliable | Actually gameable |

## Q8: What is the precision needed?

[VOI: MED - affects effort but same measurement goal]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High precision needed | MED | Invest in accuracy vs. estimate | Careful measurement | False precision |
| Unknown precision need | MED | Assess need vs. guess | May waste effort | Wrong precision level |
| Approximate is fine | LOW | Quick and cheap vs. precise | Estimate | Need more precision |
| Order of magnitude | LOW | Very rough vs. precise | Quick check | Too rough |

---

## Q9: What is signal vs noise?

[VOI: HIGH - acting on noise leads to wrong decisions]

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (Ask First - Determines Measurement Approach)**
1. Q1: Measurable - quantitative vs. qualitative approach
2. Q2: Right metric - what to optimize
3. Q7: Gaming-resistant - metric validity
4. Q9: Signal vs noise - data quality
5. Q3: Baseline - change detection
6. Q4: Target - success definition

**MED VOI (Ask Second - Refine Approach)**
7. Q5: Frequency - feedback timing
8. Q6: Who measures - objectivity
9. Q8: Precision - effort level
10. Q10: Observer effect - validity
11. Q11: Visualization - communication

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Measurement Accuracy**. High precision can be LOW VOI if you're measuring the wrong thing.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. HIGH VOI means: if you're wrong about this measurement aspect, you'll either optimize the wrong metric or make decisions based on noise.
