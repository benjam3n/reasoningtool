# Universal: Expectancy Beliefs (160)

**Category**: SEARCH - What Determines Whether Search Begins?
**Source**: Dilts "Beliefs: Pathways to Health" - Outcome Expectancy, Self-Efficacy, Response Expectancy
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Three beliefs gate whether search happens:**

1. **Outcome Expectancy**: Is this achievable (by anyone)?
   - No = Hopelessness (it's impossible)

2. **Self-Efficacy**: Can this entity achieve it?
   - No = Helplessness (possible but not for me/us)

3. **Response Expectancy**: Will the action produce the result?
   - No = Skepticism (action won't lead to outcome)

Missing any one blocks search at a different point.

## Q1: Is this outcome believed to be achievable?

[VOI: HIGH - no = hopelessness, no search]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No (believed impossible) | HIGH | No search occurs | Address impossibility belief first | No action taken |
| Yes (believed possible) | LOW | Proceed to self-efficacy | Check self-efficacy | Actually believed impossible |

---

## Q2: Is the searcher believed capable of achieving it?

[VOI: HIGH - no = helplessness, no personal action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No (believed incapable) | HIGH | No personal action occurs | Address capability belief first | No personal action |
| Yes (believed capable) | LOW | Proceed to response expectancy | Check response expectancy | Actually believed incapable |

---

## Q3: Is the action believed to produce the result?

[VOI: HIGH - no = skepticism, uncommitted action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No (action won't work) | HIGH | Uncommitted action | Address mechanism belief first | Half-hearted effort |
| Yes (action will work) | LOW | Full commitment possible | Proceed | Actually skeptical |

---

## Q4: Which belief is missing?

[VOI: HIGH - different missing belief = different intervention]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Outcome expectancy | HIGH | Show examples of success | Provide evidence it's possible | Wrong intervention |
| Self-efficacy | HIGH | Build resources/capability | Provide evidence of capability | Wrong intervention |
| Response expectancy | HIGH | Demonstrate mechanism | Show action leads to result | Wrong intervention |
| None missing | LOW | Proceed | Take action | Miss hidden gap |

---

## Q5: Does stated belief match behavior?

[VOI: MED - verbal may differ from actual]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Mismatch (says yes, acts no) | MED | Work with the actual belief | Address actual, not stated | Accept false positive |
| Match | LOW | Consistent | Work with stated | Miss incongruence |

---

## Q6: What would create outcome expectancy?

[VOI: MED - what evidence helps]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Examples of others succeeding | MED | Social proof | Provide examples | Wrong evidence type |
| Logical argument | MED | Reasoning | Make case | Wrong evidence type |
| Direct experience | MED | Experience | Create experience | Wrong evidence type |

---

## Q7: What would create self-efficacy?

[VOI: MED - what capability evidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Past success evidence | MED | Track record | Surface past wins | Wrong evidence |
| Capability building | MED | Skill acquisition | Train skills | Wrong intervention |
| Resource gathering | MED | Having tools | Gather resources | Wrong intervention |

---

## Q8: What would create response expectancy?

[VOI: MED - what mechanism evidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Showing causation | MED | Understanding helps | Explain mechanism | Wrong evidence |
| Small test with feedback | MED | Experience helps | Run small test | Wrong intervention |
| Others' success with same action | MED | Social proof of mechanism | Show examples | Wrong evidence |

---

## Q9: Are multiple beliefs missing?

[VOI: LOW - scope of intervention]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes (apathy = hopelessness + helplessness) | LOW | Multiple interventions needed | Address both | Miss depth |
| No (single belief missing) | LOW | Single intervention | Address one | Miss combined |

---

## Q10: Is this about one goal or all goals?

[VOI: LOW - scope of limiting belief]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| One goal | LOW | Local intervention | Work with specific | Miss broader pattern |
| All goals | LOW | Broader intervention | Address global belief | Too narrow |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Is outcome believed achievable?
2. Q2: Is searcher believed capable?
3. Q3: Is action believed to produce result?
4. Q4: Which belief is missing?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Does stated belief match behavior?
6. Q6: What would create outcome expectancy?
7. Q7: What would create self-efficacy?
8. Q8: What would create response expectancy?

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Are multiple beliefs missing?
10. Q10: Is this about one goal or all?

## The Gate Sequence

```
Outcome Expectancy: "Is it possible?"
    ↓
    No → HOPELESSNESS → Search doesn't begin
    Yes ↓

Self-Efficacy: "Can I/we do it?"
    ↓
    No → HELPLESSNESS → No personal action
    Yes ↓

Response Expectancy: "Will action produce result?"
    ↓
    No → SKEPTICISM → Half-hearted action
    Yes ↓

Full commitment to search
```

## Intervention by Missing Belief

| Missing | State | Intervention |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Outcome expectancy | Hopelessness | Show it's possible (examples, evidence) |
| Self-efficacy | Helplessness | Build resources, surface past wins, train capability |
| Response expectancy | Skepticism | Show mechanism, run small tests, social proof |
| Multiple | Apathy | Address outcome expectancy first, then self-efficacy |
