# Universal: Novelty and Creation Tensions (176)

**Category**: SEARCH - Apply Known Solutions or Find New Ones?
**Source**: Session tension analysis - conventional vs novel, maintenance vs creation
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Core Insight

**Many tensions reduce to: Do I need something new, or can I apply something known?**

This is NOT the same as risk/reward or cost/benefit. It's about whether the problem requires:
- **Known solutions applied** (conventional, maintenance, expected)
- **New solutions created** (novel, creation, surprising)

Getting this wrong wastes effort:
- Creating when applying would work → unnecessary effort
- Applying when creating is needed → stuck with wrong solution

## Q1: Has this problem been solved before?

[VOI: HIGH - determines apply vs create]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, solved before | HIGH | Apply existing solution | Leverage prior work | Miss nuance of this case |
| No, genuinely new | HIGH | Create new solution | Novel work | Reinvent wheel |
| Partially solved | MED | Adapt existing + create gap-fill | Efficient hybrid | Miss opportunities |

---

## Q2: Would the expected/conventional answer work?

[VOI: HIGH - test default before innovating]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, expected works | HIGH | Use expected | Efficient | Miss better novel option |
| No, expected fails | HIGH | Need novel | Creative work | Waste time on known-bad |
| Unknown | MED | Test expected first | Cheap verification | Delay if already know |

---

## Q3: What would a surprising solution look like?

[VOI: HIGH - generates novel candidates]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can articulate surprising option | MED | Have novel candidate | Expand options | Pursue bad novel |
| Cannot articulate | HIGH | Need to generate | Creative search | Stuck in conventional |
| Surprising = risky | LOW | Novel has downsides | Aware of costs | Avoid for wrong reasons |

---

## Q4: Am I stuck because I'm only considering familiar approaches?

[VOI: HIGH - diagnoses blockage]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, stuck in familiar | HIGH | Deliberately seek unfamiliar | Break block | Chase novelty unnecessarily |
| No, stuck for other reasons | MED | Diagnose actual block | Right diagnosis | Miss familiarity trap |
| Not stuck | LOW | Continue | Proceed | Miss subtle stuckness |

---

## Q5: What's the cost of trying something novel vs conventional?

[VOI: MED - risk assessment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Novel is cheap to try | MED | Experiment freely | Learn cheap | Commit to bad experiment |
| Novel is expensive to try | MED | Validate before committing | Protect resources | Over-cautious |
| Both cheap | LOW | Try both | Compare | Waste if one clearly better |

---

## Q6: Does the domain reward novelty or reliability?

[VOI: MED - domain fit]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Rewards novelty (creative, research) | MED | Bias toward new | Domain-appropriate | Novel for wrong domain |
| Rewards reliability (safety, operations) | MED | Bias toward proven | Domain-appropriate | Boring for wrong domain |
| Rewards both | LOW | Balance | Flexible | Miss emphasis |

---

## Q7: Is "novel" actually different or just unfamiliar to me?

[VOI: MED - calibration check]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Truly novel | MED | Creation required | Real innovation | Overestimate novelty |
| Just unfamiliar to me | MED | Learn existing | Efficient | Reinvent wheel |

---

## Q8: What's generating the push for novelty/convention?

[VOI: LOW - source check]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Problem requires it | LOW | Follow problem | Appropriate | Follow wrong signal |
| I prefer it | LOW | Check if preference fits | Self-aware | Impose preference |
| Others expect it | LOW | Check if expectation valid | Social awareness | Follow wrong norm |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Has this problem been solved before?
2. Q2: Would the expected/conventional answer work?
3. Q3: What would a surprising solution look like?
4. Q4: Am I stuck because I'm only considering familiar approaches?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: What's the cost of trying novel vs conventional?
6. Q6: Does the domain reward novelty or reliability?
7. Q7: Is "novel" actually different or just unfamiliar to me?

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: What's generating the push for novelty/convention?

## The Master Question

**"Is this problem about applying known solutions or finding new ones?"**

| Answer | Implication | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Known solutions exist | Apply, adapt, maintain | Find and apply existing |
| New solution needed | Create, innovate, explore | Generate novel options |
| Unclear | Test expected first | Cheap validation before creating |

---

## When to Apply (Conventional/Maintenance)

- Problem type is well-understood
- Existing solutions have good track record
- Cost of novelty is high
- Domain rewards reliability
- Time pressure favors proven approaches
- You're solving instance, not class

## When to Create (Novel/Innovation)

- Problem type is new or unusual
- Existing solutions have failed or don't exist
- Cost of novelty is manageable
- Domain rewards innovation
- Stuck on familiar approaches
- You're solving class, not just instance
- Expected answer clearly won't work

## Common Errors

| Error | Pattern | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Novelty bias** | Innovating when applying would work | Test conventional first |
| **Convention bias** | Applying when creating is needed | Ask "what would surprise?" |
| **False novelty** | Thinking it's new when it's just unfamiliar | Check if solved elsewhere |
| **Stuck in familiar** | Only seeing conventional options | Deliberately generate unfamiliar |
| **Novelty for novelty's sake** | Creating without problem need | Ask "does problem require new?" |

## Integration with Other Categories

| Category | Relationship to Novelty |
|----------|------------------------|
| Epistemic Stance | What do I know about existing solutions? |
| Search Strategy | If novel needed → wide search for new. If known → deep search in familiar |
| Granularity | Novel at pattern level or instance level? |
| Commitment | Commit to novel approach or keep exploring conventional? |
| Coherence | Does novel solution integrate with existing? |
