## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: What prerequisite problems must be solved first?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether to start immediately vs. delay until prerequisites clear]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Nested deeply | HIGH | Recursive approach vs. surface-level | Complex structure | Underestimate depth |
| Clear subproblems | MED | Divide and conquer vs. holistic | Structured solution | Subproblems harder than expected |
| Unknown | MED | Analysis first vs. start working | Need to decompose | Wrong decomposition |
| Atomic, no decomposition | LOW | Solve directly vs. over-decompose | Simple approach | Miss hidden subproblems |

---

## Q7: What problems compete for the same resources?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether you can proceed or must resolve conflicts first]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown competitors | HIGH | Discovery needed vs. assume clear | Surprise constraints | Resources suddenly unavailable |
| Same resources as solution | HIGH | Break cycle vs. paralysis | Chicken-egg | Paralyzed by self-constraint |
| Known competitors | MED | Plan allocation vs. assume available | Prioritized resources | Competition intensifies |
| None, dedicated resources | LOW | Full availability vs. plan sharing | Unconstrained work | Hidden competition emerges |

## Q8: What problems would this solution also solve?

[VOI: MED - affects approach breadth but same primary action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Related problems too | MED | Generalize solution vs. narrow | High leverage | Over-generalize, solve neither well |
| Unknown | MED | Look for synergies vs. single-focus | Need to explore | Miss leverage opportunities |
| Only this problem | LOW | Focused solution vs. broaden | Single purpose | Miss multi-solve opportunity |
| Unrelated problems | LOW | Extra value captured vs. not | Lucky bonus | Distraction from main goal |

---

## Q9: What problems would this solution create?

[VOI: HIGH - determines whether to proceed or redesign solution]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown new problems | HIGH | Risk analysis needed vs. proceed blind | Need exploration | Blind to created problems |
| Known new problems | MED | Plan for them vs. ignore | Prepared | Underestimate severity |
| Trade-off with existing | MED | Explicitly weigh vs. implicit | Clear decision | Implicit trade-off regretted |
| None expected | LOW | Simple implementation vs. investigate | Clean solution | Surprise problems emerge |

## Q10: How stable are the adjacent spaces?

[VOI: HIGH - determines strategy approach (one-time vs. continuous adaptation)]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| All fluid | HIGH | Dynamic strategy vs. static plan | Continuous adaptation | Static approach fails |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (Ask First - Route to Different Actions)**
1. Q1: Prerequisites - determines start vs. delay
2. Q2: Downstream dependents - determines priority level
3. Q6: Subproblem depth - determines decomposition approach
4. Q7: Resource competition - determines proceed vs. resolve conflicts
5. Q9: New problems created - determines proceed vs. redesign
6. Q10: Space stability - determines static vs. dynamic strategy

**MED VOI (Ask Second - Refine Approach)**
7. Q3: Parallel problems - adapt vs. build new
8. Q4: Opposite problems - inversion analysis value
9. Q5: Higher-level context - scope adjustment
10. Q8: Multi-solve potential - solution breadth

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance**. A question can be important but LOW VOI if the answer doesn't change what you do.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. HIGH VOI means: if you answer this wrong, you'll take a completely different (and wrong) action path.
