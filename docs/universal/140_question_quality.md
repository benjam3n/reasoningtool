# Universal: Question Quality (140)

**Category**: META - Are We Asking the Right Question?
**Source**: Problem-solving, inquiry-based learning, Socratic method
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is this the right question to be asking?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong question = right answer to wrong problem]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong question entirely | HIGH | Solving phantom | Find right question | Perfectly answer wrong question |
| Unknown if right question | MED | May be off-target | Question audit | Either phantom or real |
| Right question | LOW | On target | Answer it | Actually wrong question |

---

## Q2: Does answering this question actually help?

[VOI: HIGH - some questions don't move toward goals]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Answer won't help | HIGH | Wasted inquiry | Find useful question | Know answer, still stuck |
| Unknown if helps | MED | May be wasting | Utility analysis | Either wasted or useful |
| Answer will help | LOW | Useful inquiry | Continue | Actually won't help |

---

## Q3: Is the question answerable?

[VOI: HIGH - unanswerable questions waste effort]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Question unanswerable | HIGH | Infinite inquiry | Reframe or accept | Chase unanswerable forever |
| Unknown if answerable | MED | May be chasing | Answerability check | Either infinite or finite |
| Question answerable | LOW | Finite inquiry | Pursue answer | Actually unanswerable |

---

## Q4: Is the question too broad or too narrow?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong scope = wrong answers]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too broad | HIGH | Unfocused inquiry | Narrow the question | Boil the ocean |
| Too narrow | HIGH | Missing context | Broaden the question | Miss the forest |
| Unknown scope | MED | May be wrong scope | Scope analysis | Either too broad or narrow |
| Scope appropriate | LOW | Right focus | Continue | Actually wrong scope |

---

## Q5: Are we asking "how" when we should ask "whether"?

[VOI: HIGH - assuming the goal is right bypasses important check]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Should ask "whether" first | HIGH | Skipping feasibility/desirability | Ask whether before how | Optimize wrong thing |
| Unknown if should ask whether | MED | May be skipping | Prerequisite check | Either skip or waste |
| "How" is appropriate | LOW | Goal is valid | Continue with how | Actually should ask whether |

---

## Q6: Does the question contain hidden assumptions?

[VOI: MED - hidden assumptions bias answers]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Hidden assumptions in question | MED | Biased answers | Surface and test | Answer within false frame |
| Unknown if assumptions | MED | May be biased | Assumption audit | Either biased or clean |
| No hidden assumptions | LOW | Clean question | Answer directly | Actually has assumptions |

---

## Q7: Is this a question or a statement in disguise?

[VOI: MED - pseudo-questions don't seek information]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Statement in disguise | MED | Not really asking | Surface the statement | Pretend inquiry |
| Unknown if genuine question | MED | May be fake | Question authenticity | Either fake or real |
| Genuine question | LOW | Real inquiry | Answer genuinely | Actually a statement |

---

## Q8: What question should come before this one?

[VOI: MED - prerequisite questions affect current answer]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Prerequisite questions unanswered | MED | Building on unknown | Answer prerequisites first | Build on shaky foundation |
| Unknown if prerequisites exist | MED | May be skipping | Prerequisite check | Either shaky or solid |
| Prerequisites answered | LOW | Solid foundation | Continue | Actually unanswered |

---

## Q9: Is this the most important question right now?

[VOI: LOW - prioritization affects efficiency but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| More important questions exist | LOW | Suboptimal priority | Reprioritize | Answer less important first |
| Unknown importance | LOW | May be suboptimal | Priority check | Either suboptimal or optimal |
| Most important question | LOW | Optimal priority | Continue | Actually less important |

---

## Q10: Will the answer generate better questions?

[VOI: LOW - generativity affects learning but similar inquiry]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will generate better questions | LOW | Productive inquiry | Pursue for learning | Miss generative value |
| Unknown generativity | LOW | May miss learning | Generativity check | Either learn or not |
| Dead-end question | LOW | Terminal answer | Accept terminal | Think terminal when generative |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Right question? - on target
2. Q2: Answer helps? - utility
3. Q3: Answerable? - tractability
4. Q4: Scope right? - focus
5. Q5: "How" vs "whether"? - goal validity

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Hidden assumptions? - bias
7. Q7: Question or statement? - genuine inquiry
8. Q8: Prerequisites? - foundation

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Most important? - priority
10. Q10: Generates better questions? - learning

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth about inquiry. VOI = action divergence.**

"Will the answer generate better questions?" is intellectually interesting but has LOW VOI - you pursue learning either way.

"Is this the right question to be asking?" has HIGH VOI - wrong question means perfectly answering the wrong problem.

## Question Quality Hierarchy

Not all questions are equal:

1. **Right question**: Answering moves you toward your goal
2. **Answerable question**: Can actually be resolved
3. **Appropriately scoped**: Not too broad or narrow
4. **Well-founded**: Prerequisites are settled
5. **Assumption-free**: Not begging the question

**The trap:** Answering the question as given without checking if it's the right question.

**The move:** Before answering any question, ask "Is this the question I should be answering?" Many "hard" questions dissolve when you realize they're the wrong question.

**Einstein's insight:** "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."

The question IS most of the problem.
