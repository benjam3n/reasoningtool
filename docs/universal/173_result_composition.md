## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Complex problems have partial answers. Composition creates complete solutions.**

Search often finds:
- Pieces that address different aspects
- Alternatives that each have strengths
- Fragments that need assembly

Composition is distinct from selection (choosing one) - it's about combining many.

## Q1: What is being combined?

[VOI: HIGH - composition type]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Complementary pieces (each covers different aspect) | HIGH | Assemble into whole | Complete coverage | Redundancy or gaps |
| Alternative solutions (each covers same aspect differently) | HIGH | Integrate or select | Hybrid or choice | Force incompatible |
| Partial solutions (each covers part) | MED | Fill gaps between | Coverage | Missing connective tissue |
| Conflicting solutions | HIGH | Resolve conflict or choose | Coherence | Incoherent combination |

---

## Q2: Are the parts compatible?

[VOI: HIGH - compatibility assessment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fully compatible | MED | Direct combination | Simple assembly | Miss incompatibility |
| Partially compatible | HIGH | Modify to fit | Integration work | Force incompatible or miss compatible |
| Incompatible | HIGH | Choose one or find bridge | Resolution | Combine incompatible |

---

## Q3: What's the composition structure?

[VOI: HIGH - how pieces fit together]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sequential (one then another) | MED | Order matters | Correct sequence | Wrong order |
| Parallel (simultaneous) | MED | All at once | Coordination | Interference |
| Hierarchical (nesting) | MED | Levels of abstraction | Clear structure | Wrong nesting |
| Network (interconnected) | HIGH | Dependencies between parts | Handle connections | Miss dependencies |

---

## Q4: Are there gaps between parts?

[VOI: HIGH - gap identification]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, gaps exist | HIGH | Fill gaps | Complete solution | Incomplete |
| No gaps | LOW | Parts cover everything | Proceed | Miss gaps |
| Unknown | MED | Assess coverage | Map what's covered | Assume wrongly |

---

## Q5: Are there redundancies between parts?

[VOI: MED - redundancy handling]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, redundant coverage | MED | Reconcile or use for validation | Efficient or validated | Inefficient or conflict |
| No redundancy | LOW | Proceed | Simple combination | Miss redundancy |

---

## Q6: How do the parts interact?

[VOI: MED - interaction effects]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Synergistic (better together) | MED | Maximize interaction | Emergent value | Miss synergy |
| Independent (no interaction) | LOW | Simple addition | Straightforward | Miss interactions |
| Antagonistic (worse together) | HIGH | Minimize interaction or choose | Avoid degradation | Combine and degrade |

---

## Q7: What's the integration mechanism?

[VOI: MED - how to combine]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Weighted average | LOW | Blend proportionally | Smooth combination | Lose extremes |
| Voting/consensus | LOW | Majority or agreement | Democratic | Miss valuable minority |
| Best of each | MED | Take strongest aspects | Optimal hybrid | Miss coherence |
| Transformation | HIGH | Create new from parts | Novel synthesis | Forced transformation |

---

## Q8: Is the composition reversible?

[VOI: LOW - reversibility]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, can decompose back | LOW | Flexible | Iterate | N/A |
| No, permanent combination | LOW | Careful before combining | Deliberate | Premature commitment |

## Composition Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Assembly** | Parts make whole | Components → product |
| **Synthesis** | Parts create new | Ideas → theory |
| **Aggregation** | Parts collected | Data points → summary |
| **Integration** | Parts merged | Systems → unified system |
| **Hybridization** | Best of multiple | Approaches → hybrid |

---

## Composition Patterns

| Pattern | How It Works | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Layering** | Stack parts on each other | Parts at different levels |
| **Sequencing** | Chain parts in order | Parts are steps |
| **Parallel** | Run parts simultaneously | Independent parts |
| **Nesting** | Parts contain parts | Hierarchical structure |
| **Weaving** | Interleave parts | Parts complement throughout |

---

## Handling Conflicts

| Conflict Type | Resolution Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Contradiction** | One must be wrong → diagnose |
| **Trade-off** | Can't have both → prioritize |
| **Incompatibility** | Can't combine directly → find bridge |
| **Competition** | Both valid but different → choose or partition |

---

## Composition Quality Checks

- [ ] All aspects covered (no gaps)
- [ ] No contradictions between parts
- [ ] Interactions identified and handled
- [ ] Integration is coherent
- [ ] Result is more than sum of parts (or at least as good)
- [ ] Original requirements met

## Common Composition Errors

| Error | Pattern | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Forced combination** | Combine incompatible parts | Acknowledge incompatibility |
| **Missing glue** | Parts don't connect | Add integration layer |
| **Lost coherence** | Combination is incoherent | Step back, find organizing principle |
| **Lowest common denominator** | Lose best of each | Preserve strengths |
| **Frankenstein** | Parts work alone, not together | Test combination explicitly |
