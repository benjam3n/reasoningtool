## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q2: What evidence confirms constraint is real? (is constraint even real?)
2. Q6: Is the constraint origin still valid? (is constraint outdated?)
3. Q10: Do I meet all minimum requirements? (can I start now?)
4. Q8: What is the minimum time required? (hard time floor)
5. Q12: If full goal not achievable, what is largest portion? (fallback option)
6. Q3: Has anyone overcome this constraint? (constraint is soft?)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: What type of constraints exist? (constraint classification)
8. Q5: What is the origin of each constraint? (constraint source)
9. Q7: What is the minimum resource set? (resource requirements)
10. Q9: What is the minimum skill set? (skill requirements)
11. Q11: What would it take to meet requirements? (gap filling)
12. Q4: What change would remove constraint? (workarounds)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is this constraint real?" is HIGH VOI because REAL → work around it, NOT REAL → ignore it entirely. These are opposite approaches.

Feasibility errors are particularly costly because they mean pursuing impossible goals. That's why this category has higher HIGH% than average.

QUESTIONS: 12
GUESSES: 59

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 18 guesses (31%)
- MED: 27 guesses (46%)
- LOW: 14 guesses (23%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because feasibility errors = pursuing impossible goals

HIGH-VOI Entries (ask first):
- Q1: Physical law / Assumed / Unknown - constraint reality
- Q2: Weak / No / Contradicting / Unknown evidence - constraint validity
