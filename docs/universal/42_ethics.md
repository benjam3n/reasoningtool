## Q4: Who is negatively affected by this goal?

## Q5: What is the nature of the harm?
[VOI: HIGH - Physical/psychological harm requires high priority vs standard handling]
Prerequisite: Q4 shows harm exists

| Unknown harm nature | HIGH | Characterize first vs act | Harm characterization | Nature known |
| Financial harm | MED | Consider compensation vs proceed | Consider compensation | Different harm |
| Time/opportunity harm | MED | Acknowledge impact vs ignore | Acknowledge impact | Different harm |
| Relationship harm | MED | Manage relationships vs ignore | Manage relationships | Different harm |

---

## Q6: Is the harm necessary or incidental?
[VOI: HIGH - Necessary harm means accept or change goal vs eliminate harm]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Necessary for goal | HIGH | Accept or change goal vs remove | Accept or change goal | Actually incidental |
| Unknown necessity | MED | Analyze first vs assume | Necessity analysis | Necessity known |
| Incidental to goal | MED | Remove harm vs accept | Remove harm | Actually necessary |

---

## Q7: Can the harm be reduced while achieving the goal?
[VOI: HIGH - Cannot reduce means accept or change vs reduce harm]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cannot reduce | HIGH | Accept or change goal vs reduce | Accept or change goal | Can reduce |
| Unknown if reducible | MED | Explore options vs assume | Reduction analysis | Reducibility known |
| Can significantly reduce | MED | Make reductions vs accept | Reduce harm | Less reducible |
| Can somewhat reduce | MED | Partial reduction vs accept | Make reductions | Different amount |

---

## Q8: Can those harmed be compensated?
[VOI: HIGH - Cannot compensate means irreversible harm consideration vs compensation path]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cannot compensate | HIGH | Extra consideration vs compensate | Extra consideration | Can compensate |

---

## Q9: Can those harmed avoid the harm?
[VOI: HIGH - Cannot avoid means imposed harm, extra responsibility vs inform]

| Cannot avoid | HIGH | Extra responsibility vs inform | Extra responsibility | Can avoid |
| Unknown if avoidable | MED | Analyze first vs assume | Avoidance analysis | Avoidability known |
| Can avoid with effort | MED | Reduce burden vs inform | Reduce burden | Different level |
| Can easily avoid | LOW | Inform of option either way | Inform of option | Cannot avoid |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: Values conflict? (Major → modify/abandon vs proceed)
2. Q3: Boundaries? (Vague/None → define first vs proceed)
3. Q4: Who harmed? (Significant/Unknown → mitigation vs proceed)
4. Q5: Harm nature? (Physical/Psychological → high priority vs standard)
5. Q6: Necessary harm? (Yes → accept or change vs eliminate)
6. Q7: Can reduce? (No → accept or change vs reduce)
7. Q8: Can compensate? (No → extra consideration vs compensate)
8. Q9: Can avoid? (No → extra responsibility vs inform)
9. Q2: Can modify? (No → values decision vs modify)

**MED VOI (ask second - refine approach):**
(Questions already ordered above)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Moral Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question about "major vs minor conflict" has HIGH VOI because it routes to completely different actions: "abandon the goal" vs "proceed with minor adjustments." The moral weight is separate from the action divergence.

Even "low moral severity" situations can have HIGH VOI if they create completely different action paths. Conversely, morally weighty situations can have LOW VOI if the actions would be similar regardless.
