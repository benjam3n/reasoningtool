# DEPRECATED: Dependencies (28)

**Status**: MERGED into 14_dependencies.md

This file has been merged with 14_dependencies.md to create a comprehensive dependency analysis.

## What Happened

- **14_dependencies.md** originally covered dependency properties (existence, type, direction, strength, etc.)
- **28_dependencies.md** originally covered prerequisites and hidden assumptions (from YAML mapping)
- Both are now combined in **14_dependencies.md** which has 22 questions in 3 parts:
  - Part A: Dependency Properties (Q1-Q10)
  - Part B: Prerequisites and Critical Path (Q11-Q18)
  - Part C: Hidden Dependencies and Assumptions (Q19-Q22)

## Action

Use **14_dependencies.md** instead of this file.

This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
