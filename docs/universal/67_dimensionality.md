## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
1. Q1 (Controllable?) - agency exists or not
2. Q2 (Degrees of freedom?) - can optimize or not
3. Q3 (Overlooked options?) - missing leverage
4. Q4 (Solution lifts?) - solving right problem
5. Q5 (Dimensional mismatch?) - valid comparison
6. Q6 (Units consistent?) - valid calculations

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q7 (Variable count?) - model complexity
8. Q8 (Sensitivity?) - where to focus
9. Q9 (Constraints?) - option space limits
10. Q10 (Proxy problem?) - results transfer

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ mathematical complexity**

**VOI = action divergence**

Q1 "Are any variables controllable?" is HIGH VOI because:
- YES → use your levers to influence outcome
- NO → must accept situation or change game entirely (different work)

Q7 "How many variables?" is MED VOI because:
- FEW → simple model
- MANY → dimensionality reduction (same goal, different modeling approach)

Controllability determines if you can act at all. Variable count affects how you model what you can act on.
