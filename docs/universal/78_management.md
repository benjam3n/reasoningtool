## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q7: Is each piece of work assigned to someone?
[VOI: HIGH - unassigned work will fall through vs assigned has ownership]

| Some unassigned | HIGH | Assign all vs accept gaps | Assign all | All assigned |
| Unknown assignment | MED | Assignment check vs proceed | Assignment check | Assignment known |
| All assigned | LOW | Track progress | Track progress | Some unassigned |

---

## Q8: Does assignee know they are assigned?
[VOI: HIGH - doesn't know means won't do it vs knows means will act]

| No, doesn't know | HIGH | Notify vs expect work | Notify | Already knows |
| Unknown if knows | MED | Confirmation vs assume | Confirmation | Knowledge known |
| Yes, knows | LOW | Expect work | Proceed | Doesn't know |

---

## Q9: Does assignee have capacity and capability?
[VOI: HIGH - lacks either means will fail vs has both means can deliver]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Has capacity, lacks capability | HIGH | Train or reassign vs proceed | Train or reassign | Has capability |
| Has capability, lacks capacity | HIGH | Reprioritize vs overload | Reprioritize | Has capacity |
| Neither | HIGH | Reassign vs fail | Reassign | Has both |
| Unknown ability | MED | Ability check vs assume | Ability check | Ability known |
| Yes, both | LOW | Proceed with confidence | Proceed | Missing one or both |

---

## Q10: Is work at the right granularity?
[VOI: MED - too vague/detailed requires adjustment vs right level is actionable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |

| Too vague | MED | Break down vs proceed | Break down | Right level |
| Too detailed | MED | Aggregate vs proceed | Aggregate | Right level |
| Unknown granularity | MED | Granularity check vs proceed | Granularity check | Granularity known |
| Right granularity | LOW | Proceed | Proceed | Wrong granularity |

---

## Q11: Are there dependencies between pieces of work?
[VOI: MED - dependencies require coordination vs independent enables parallel]

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Status current? Accurate? - reality check
- Q3-Q4: Capacity? Tradeoffs? - feasibility
- Q5-Q6: Work clear? Captured? - what to manage
- Q7-Q9: Assigned? Knows? Able? - ownership and capability

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q10-Q12: Granularity, dependencies, escalation

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ management best practice importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (clarify scope vs proceed, train vs expect work, cut scope vs add resources). Low VOI questions refine how you manage within an established approach.
