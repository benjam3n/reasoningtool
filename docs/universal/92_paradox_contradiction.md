**Category**: META - When Things Don't Add Up
**Source**: Contradictions signal something important
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is something presented as solvable that's actually a tradeoff?

[VOI: HIGH - tradeoffs can't be solved, only navigated]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inherent tradeoff | HIGH | No solution, only balance | Navigate tradeoff | Exhaust resources seeking impossible |
| Unknown which | MED | May be chasing phantom | Problem type analysis | Either miss solution or chase phantom |
| Solvable problem | LOW | Solution exists | Find solution | Chase solution to tradeoff |

---

## Q2: Is something presented as a tradeoff that's actually solvable?

[VOI: HIGH - false tradeoffs hide solutions]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| False tradeoff | HIGH | Solution hidden | Find creative solution | Accept unnecessary limitation |
| Unknown which | MED | May miss option | Tradeoff testing | Either accept false or seek impossible |
| True tradeoff | LOW | Must choose | Accept tradeoff | Miss available solution |

---

## Q3: Does the question assume a false dichotomy?

[VOI: HIGH - "A or B?" might have C as answer]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| False dichotomy | HIGH | Other options exist | Find C | Constrain to bad options |
| Unknown if true | MED | May be missing | Dichotomy testing | Either miss option or waste seeking |
| True dichotomy | LOW | Choose between | Choose A or B | Miss C |

---

## Q4: Are the stated goals actually in conflict?

[VOI: HIGH - conflicting goals can't all be achieved]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Goals in conflict | HIGH | Can't achieve all | Prioritize | Try for all, achieve none well |
| Unknown if conflict | MED | May be incompatible | Conflict check | Wonder why partial failures |
| Goals compatible | LOW | All achievable | Pursue all | Actually in conflict, fail |

---

## Q5: Are opposing forces creating a stuck pattern?

[VOI: HIGH - push and pull can create equilibrium that resists change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Opposing forces balanced | HIGH | Stuck pattern | Change the forces | Push harder, still stuck |
| Unknown if opposed | MED | May be stuck | Force field analysis | Wonder why nothing changes |
| No opposing forces | LOW | Clear path | Move forward | Actually blocked by opposition |

---

## Q6: Are we being told contradictory things?

[VOI: HIGH - contradictory inputs can't both be true]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inputs contradictory | HIGH | At least one wrong | Resolve before acting | Act on contradiction, fail |
| Unknown if consistent | MED | May be inconsistent | Consistency check | Unknowingly act on contradictions |
| Inputs consistent | LOW | Can trust both | Use both | Contradictory inputs unnoticed |

---

## Q7: Are there contradictions in what we believe?

[VOI: HIGH - internal contradictions mean at least one belief is wrong]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Contradictions exist | HIGH | At least one wrong | Resolve contradiction | Act on inconsistent beliefs |
| Unknown if contradictory | MED | May have problems | Contradiction check | Unknowingly inconsistent |
| No contradictions | LOW | Internally consistent | Proceed | Actually contradictory, fail mysteriously |

---

## Q8: Are we trying to have it both ways?

[VOI: HIGH - wanting contradictory things leads to confused action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Trying to have both | HIGH | Will get neither | Choose one | Confused action, get neither |
| Unknown if both | MED | May be confused | Priority check | Unknowingly wanting impossible |
| Clear priority | LOW | Can choose | Make tradeoff | Actually want both, fail |

---

## Q9: Does the proposed solution create new problems?

[VOI: MED - affects net value but similar evaluation process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Net negative | HIGH | Makes things worse | Reject | Implement, things worse |
| Breaks even | MED | Not actually helpful | Find better | Effort for nothing |
| Unknown net effect | MED | May be negative | Effect analysis | Unknowingly worsen |
| Net positive | LOW | Real solution | Implement | Creates as many problems |

---

## Q10: Is this a paradox or just poorly stated?

[VOI: MED - affects analysis but similar resolution process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Poor framing | MED | Can be dissolved | Reframe clearly | Accept false paradox |
| Unknown which | MED | May be solvable | Paradox analysis | Either stuck or miss solution |
| True paradox | LOW | Requires transcendence | Transcend | Treat as error when genuine |

---

## Q11: Is a strength in one context a weakness in another?

[VOI: LOW - affects adaptation but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Context-dependent | LOW | Must adapt | Adapt to context | Strength becomes weakness |
| Unknown if context-dependent | LOW | May misapply | Context analysis | Either over or under adapt |
| Context-independent | LOW | Same approach | Consistent approach | Apply wrong in new context |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Solvable or tradeoff? - determines whether solution exists
2. Q2: False tradeoff? - hidden solution
3. Q3: False dichotomy? - missed option C
4. Q4: Goals in conflict? - can't achieve all
5. Q5: Opposing forces? - stuck pattern
6. Q6: Contradictory inputs? - at least one wrong
7. Q7: Internal contradictions? - inconsistent beliefs
8. Q8: Trying to have both? - will get neither

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
9. Q9: Solution creates problems? - net effect
10. Q10: Paradox or poor framing? - dissolution possible

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
11. Q11: Context-dependent strength? - adaptation

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ logical sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is this a true paradox?" sounds deep but has MED/LOW VOI - you still do similar analysis work.

"Is this actually a tradeoff, not a problem?" has HIGH VOI - if it's a tradeoff, you stop seeking solutions and start navigating.
