## Q7: Is there spaced repetition (review over time)?

| Unknown spacing | MED | Spacing check vs proceed | Spacing check | Why do I have to relearn this? |
| Yes, spaced | LOW | Retention, maintain | Maintain spacing | Cram, forget, have to relearn |

---

## Q8: Is there retrieval practice (testing yourself)?
[VOI: HIGH - passive review means weak retention vs retrieval practice strengthens memory]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

| Unknown if retrieval | MED | Retrieval check vs proceed | Retrieval check | Familiarity mistaken for knowledge |
| Yes, retrieval practice | LOW | Strengthening memory, continue | Continue | Confident without actual retention |

---

## Q9: Is there transfer (can apply in new contexts)?
[VOI: HIGH - context-bound means fragile learning vs transfer means useful learning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |

| No, context-bound | HIGH | Add varied contexts vs accept fragile | Add varied contexts | Ace test, fail in practice |
| Unknown transfer | MED | Transfer testing vs proceed | Transfer testing | Competent in training, incompetent in reality |
| Yes, transfers | LOW | Useful learning, broaden | Broaden application | "Learned" but can't use outside specific context |

---

## Q10: Is there interleaving (mixing topics/skills)?
[VOI: MED - blocked practice is less effective but still works]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, blocked | MED | Add interleaving vs accept less transfer | Add interleaving | Perform in practice, fail in reality |
| Unknown interleaving | LOW | Interleaving check vs proceed | Interleaving check | Comfortable but poor transfer |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Goal clear? Gap identified? - what to learn
- Q6, Q9: Applied? Transfers? - real vs illusory learning
- Q4-Q5: Deliberate? Feedback? - practice quality
- Q3: Right level? - difficulty calibration
- Q7-Q8: Spaced? Retrieval? - retention strategies

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q10-Q12: Interleaving, social, metacognition - learning optimization

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ learning science importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (clarify goal vs wander, add application vs consume, add self-testing vs reread). Low VOI questions optimize within an established learning approach.
