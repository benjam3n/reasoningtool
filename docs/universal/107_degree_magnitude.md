# Universal: Degree / Magnitude (107)

**Category**: CORE DIMENSION - How Much
**Source**: Derived from space discovery - standard dimensions
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## Why This Exists

The core dimensions include DEGREE (how much) but no file explicitly covered it.
This file addresses magnitude, intensity, extent, and quantity questions.

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: What is the SCALE of this?

[VOI: HIGH - scale determines entire approach]

| Diminishing returns | MED | Stop at optimum | Optimize stopping | Stop too early if appreciating |
| Linear returns | LOW | Constant benefit | Proportional investment | Miss non-linearity |

## Q7: What is the RATE of change?

[VOI: MED - affects monitoring but similar work]

| Slow change | LOW | Gradual | Periodic updates | Update too frequently |
| Static (no change) | LOW | Stable | Single measurement | Miss that it's changing |

## Q8: Is the degree FIXED or VARIABLE?

[VOI: MED - affects strategy but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fixed | MED | Can't change | Plan around constraint | Try to change fixed |
| Negotiable | MED | Can influence | Negotiate | Accept when could change |
| Unknown variability | MED | May be constrained | Variability check | Discover constraint late |
| Variable | LOW | Changes over time | Adapt approach | Expect fixed |

## Q9: What is the INTENSITY level?

[VOI: MED - affects approach but similar work]

## Q10: What PERCENTAGE/PROPORTION applies?

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Scale? - determines entire approach
2. Q2: Sufficient? - shortage = failure
3. Q3: Maximum limit? - breach = consequences
4. Q4: Minimum viable? - falling short = failure
5. Q5: Threshold for action? - decision rule
6. Q6: Returns pattern? - continue or stop

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
7. Q7: Rate of change? - monitoring
8. Q8: Fixed or variable? - strategy
9. Q9: Intensity level? - approach

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
10. Q10: Proportion? - allocation detail
11. Q11: Precision needed? - measurement detail

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ numerical precision. VOI = action divergence.**

"What exact percentage applies?" feels precise but has LOW VOI - you make similar allocation decisions.

"Is the degree sufficient?" has HIGH VOI - insufficient means completely different action (get more or reduce scope).

## Usage Note

This category covers HOW MUCH of something, distinct from:
- 11_scope.md - how broadly (breadth)
- 09_constraints.md - limits on what

→ Use DEGREE for magnitude, intensity, quantity, proportion
→ Pairs with: 103_returns_analysis.md (for returns on degree)
