## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Will this reasoning face external scrutiny?

[VOI: HIGH - scrutiny forces higher standards]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will face scrutiny, treating as private | HIGH | Underdefended | Add rigor and justification | Embarrassed by weak reasoning |
| Won't face scrutiny, treating as public | MED | Over-defended | Simplify | Wasted defensive effort |
| Unknown scrutiny level | MED | May mismatch | Scrutiny prediction | Either under or over defend |
| Scrutiny level matched | LOW | Appropriate defense | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q2: Who will do the scrutinizing?

[VOI: HIGH - expert vs lay scrutiny require different defenses]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Experts will scrutinize | HIGH | Technical defense needed | Rigorous justification | Amateur defense to experts |
| Lay audience will scrutinize | MED | Accessibility needed | Accessible justification | Technical to lay audience |
| Unknown scrutinizers | MED | May mismatch | Audience prediction | Either too technical or simple |
| Scrutiny type matched | LOW | Appropriate defense | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q3: Is the scrutiny adversarial or collaborative?

[VOI: HIGH - adversarial requires anticipating attacks]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Adversarial scrutiny | HIGH | Must anticipate attacks | Preempt objections | Blindsided by attacks |
| Unknown scrutiny type | MED | May be blindsided | Scrutiny type analysis | Either attacked or wasted defense |
| Collaborative scrutiny | LOW | Partners improving | Welcome critique | Paranoid when collaborative |

---

## Q4: Will I need to defend this reasoning later?

[VOI: HIGH - future defense requires documentation now]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will need to defend, not documenting | HIGH | Future self can't defend | Document reasoning now | Can't explain past reasoning |
| Unknown if will defend | MED | May need documentation | Document conservatively | Either documented or not |
| Won't need to defend | LOW | No documentation needed | Skip documentation | Actually will need |

---

## Q5: Does collective intelligence apply here?

[VOI: HIGH - collective can correct individual biases]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Collective would improve but going solo | HIGH | Missing correction | Seek external input | Individual biases unchecked |
| Unknown if collective helps | MED | May be missing | Collective potential analysis | Either solo or seek input |
| Collective not applicable | LOW | Solo appropriate | Continue solo | Miss collective benefit |

---

## Q6: Are we motivated reasoning that would be caught publicly?

[VOI: MED - public exposure reveals bias]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Motivated reasoning present | MED | Bias active | Self-critique before public | Bias exposed publicly |
| Unknown if motivated | MED | May have bias | Motivation check | Either biased or clear |
| Reasoning not motivated | LOW | Clean reasoning | Proceed | Actually motivated |

---

## Q7: Would we be comfortable if reasoning were made public?

[VOI: MED - comfort test reveals hidden problems]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Uncomfortable with public | MED | Something wrong | Fix what causes discomfort | Hidden problem |
| Unknown comfort level | MED | May have hidden issue | Comfort test | Either problem or fine |
| Comfortable with public | LOW | Reasoning defensible | Proceed | Actually uncomfortable |

---

## Q8: Is there selection bias in who's scrutinizing?

[VOI: MED - biased scrutiny gives false confidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Only friendly scrutiny | MED | False validation | Seek hostile scrutiny | Think validated when not |
| Unknown scrutiny selection | MED | May be biased | Selection analysis | Either biased or diverse |
| Diverse scrutiny | LOW | Real validation | Trust validation | Actually biased |

---

## Q9: Is documentation creating false confidence?

[VOI: LOW - affects confidence but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Documentation = false rigor | LOW | Appearance not substance | Add substance | Look rigorous, be weak |
| Unknown if false | LOW | May be appearances | Substance check | Either appearance or real |
| Documentation reflects real rigor | LOW | Genuine | Proceed | Actually false rigor |

---

## Q10: Will time reveal the reasoning quality?

[VOI: LOW - affects future but similar present action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Time will reveal | LOW | Eventually tested | Optimize for long run | Short-term only |
| Unknown if revealed | LOW | May be tested | Assume revelation | Either tested or not |
| Time won't reveal | LOW | Won't be tested | Can be expedient | Actually will be tested |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Will face scrutiny? - defense level
2. Q2: Who scrutinizes? - defense type
3. Q3: Adversarial or collaborative? - attack anticipation
4. Q4: Need to defend later? - documentation
5. Q5: Collective intelligence applies? - external correction

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Motivated reasoning? - bias check
7. Q7: Comfortable if public? - hidden problems
8. Q8: Selection bias in scrutiny? - validation quality

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: False documentation confidence? - substance vs appearance
10. Q10: Time reveals quality? - long run

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ epistemological sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Will time reveal the reasoning quality?" is philosophical but has LOW VOI - you reason carefully either way.

"Will this reasoning face external scrutiny?" has HIGH VOI - scrutiny forces rigor that private reasoning skips.

## The Argumentative Theory of Reasoning

Mercier & Sperber's insight: Reasoning evolved for social justification, not private truth-seeking.

**Implications:**
- Solitary reasoning is lazy and biased
- Collective argumentation corrects individual biases
- Public justification quality > private inference quality
- Anticipated scrutiny improves current reasoning

**The trap:** Private reasoning feels rigorous but isn't tested.

**The move:** Before finalizing private reasoning, imagine defending it to a hostile expert. What would they attack? Fix those weaknesses now.
