2. Q2: Investment required - decision-making rigor level
3. Q3: Expected return - investment justification
4. Q4: Risk of loss - mitigation approach
5. Q5: Reversibility - certainty level needed
6. Q6: Ongoing costs - sustainability
7. Q7: Opportunity cost - best use of money
8. Q9: Who bears risk - accountability
9. Q10: Financing available - feasibility

**MED VOI (Ask Second - Optimize)**
10. Q8: Time value - timing optimization
11. Q11: Tax implications - efficiency

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Dollar Amount**. A small expense can be HIGH VOI if it's irreversible. A large expense can be LOW VOI if easily reversible.

**VOI = Action Divergence**. HIGH VOI means: if you're wrong about this financial aspect, you'll make a fundamentally different (and wrong) financial decision.
