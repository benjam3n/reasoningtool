## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q7: Is there clear purpose/meaning in the work?

## Q8: Are there competing motivations creating internal conflict?
[VOI: HIGH - competing motivations create paralysis vs no conflict enables clear action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Competing motivations | HIGH | Resolve conflict vs expect consistency | Resolve conflict | Blame inconsistency on character not conflict |
| Unknown if conflict | MED | Conflict exploration vs proceed | Conflict exploration | Wonder why person won't decide |
| No conflict | LOW | Proceed with clear direction | Proceed | Hidden conflict creates unpredictable behavior |

---

## Q9: Is there fear/anxiety blocking action?
[VOI: HIGH - fear present requires addressing vs no fear enables action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fear present | HIGH | Address fear directly vs push harder | Address fear directly | Push harder, increase anxiety, worse avoidance |
| Unknown if fear | MED | Fear assessment vs proceed | Fear assessment | Procrastination label when actually paralysis |
| No significant fear | LOW | Proceed, action possible | Proceed | Force action, traumatize, lose trust |

---

## Q10: Is there learned helplessness (past failures created giving up)?
[VOI: HIGH - learned helplessness requires rebuilding agency vs intact agency enables normal expectations]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Learned helplessness present | HIGH | Small wins, rebuild agency vs expect initiative | Small wins, rebuild agency | Blame "lack of initiative" for trauma response |
| Unknown if present | MED | History exploration vs proceed | History exploration | "Unmotivated" label for learned hopelessness |
| No learned helplessness | LOW | Normal expectations | Normal expectations | Expect action from someone who's given up |

---

## Q11: Is the motivation intrinsic (from the activity itself) or extrinsic (from rewards)?
[VOI: MED - source determines intervention type but both can work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Extrinsic | MED | Maintain rewards vs assume intrinsic | Maintain rewards | Removes rewards thinking intrinsic, motivation dies |

| Unknown source | MED | Motivation source analysis vs guess | Motivation source analysis | Wrong intervention backfires |
| Intrinsic | LOW | Remove barriers, don't add rewards | Remove barriers, don't add rewards | Added rewards undermine intrinsic drive |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1: Safety? - will they tell you truth
- Q5-Q6: Efficacy? Outcome belief? - will they try
- Q9-Q10: Fear? Helplessness? - what's blocking
- Q2-Q4: Autonomy, growth, connection - needs met?
- Q7-Q8: Meaning, conflict - drivers and blockers

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q11: Motivation source - intrinsic vs extrinsic calibration

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological importance or depth**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (build safety vs expect transparency, address fear vs push harder, rebuild agency vs expect initiative). Low VOI questions calibrate approach within an established motivational framework.
