## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: What information is required that I don't have?

## Q3: What is required to obtain the information?

## Q4: What is the cost of proceeding without the information?
[VOI: HIGH - high cost means must get info first]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High cost (failure likely) | HIGH | Stop and acquire vs proceed | Stop and acquire | Cost is lower |

| Moderate cost (suboptimal) | MED | Weigh tradeoff vs proceed | Weigh cost | Cost different |
| Low cost (minor issues) | LOW | Move forward vs wait | Move forward | Cost is higher |
| No cost | LOW | Proceed vs wait | Proceed | Cost exists |

---

## Q5: What am I most uncertain about?
[VOI: HIGH - uncertain about goal/feasibility changes entire direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Goal definition | HIGH | Clarify goal vs proceed | Clarify goal | Goal clear |
| Feasibility | HIGH | Verify feasibility vs assume | Verify feasibility | Feasible |
| Approach/method | MED | Validate approach vs assume | Validate approach | Approach correct |
| Resource estimates | MED | Refine estimates vs use | Refine estimates | Estimates accurate |
| External factors | MED | Monitor externals vs assume stable | Monitor externals | Externals stable |
| Timeline | LOW | Buffer timeline vs use | Buffer timeline | Timeline accurate |

---

## Q6: What specific information would resolve each uncertainty?
[VOI: HIGH - info not identified or doesn't exist means can't resolve]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Information not identified | HIGH | Identify info needs vs guess | Identify info needs | Already identified |
| Information doesn't exist | HIGH | Accept uncertainty vs seek | Accept uncertainty | Info exists |
| Information identified | LOW | Gather that info vs identify more | Gather that info | Wrong info |

---

## Q7: What decisions cannot be made until uncertainty is resolved?
[VOI: HIGH - critical decisions blocked means can't proceed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Critical decisions blocked | HIGH | Resolve first vs proceed | Resolve first | Can decide now |
| Minor decisions blocked | LOW | Proceed, defer minor vs resolve all | Proceed, defer minor | More blocked |
| No decisions blocked | LOW | Move forward vs analyze | Move forward | Decisions blocked |

---

## Q8: Is it better to resolve uncertainty first or proceed and adapt?
[VOI: HIGH - resolve first vs proceed changes immediate action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Resolve first - high stakes | HIGH | Stop and research vs start | Stop and research | Can adapt |
| Unknown which strategy | MED | Evaluate stakes vs guess | Evaluate stakes | Strategy clear |
| Hybrid - resolve critical | MED | Selective research vs all or none | Selective research | Wrong balance |
| Proceed and adapt - low stakes | LOW | Start now vs wait | Start now | Should wait |

---

## Q9: What experiments could reduce uncertainty?
[VOI: MED - affects how to reduce uncertainty but same direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cheap experiment available | MED | Run experiment vs proceed | Run experiment | No experiment works |
| Expensive experiment only | MED | Evaluate if worth it vs skip | Evaluate if worth it | Cheaper exists |
| No experiment possible | MED | Accept uncertainty vs keep seeking | Accept uncertainty | Experiment possible |
| Experiment not needed | LOW | Proceed vs experiment | Proceed | Should experiment |

---

## Q10: What does each experiment outcome tell us?
[VOI: HIGH - no interpretation means wasted experiment]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No interpretation known | HIGH | Design before running vs waste | Design before running | Interpretation known |
| Ambiguous interpretation | MED | Refine experiment vs accept | Refine experiment | Clear results |
| Clear interpretation | LOW | Act on results vs refine | Act on results | Interpretation wrong |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q1: What information is required that I don't have? (what's missing?)
2. Q4: What is cost of proceeding without? (should we wait?)
3. Q8: Resolve uncertainty first or proceed and adapt? (strategy)
4. Q5: What am I most uncertain about? (focus area)
5. Q7: What decisions are blocked? (can we proceed?)
6. Q6: What info would resolve uncertainty? (can we resolve?)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q2: Where does required info exist? (sources)
8. Q3: What is required to obtain info? (acquisition)
9. Q9: What experiments could reduce uncertainty? (testing)
10. Q10: What do experiment outcomes tell us? (interpretation)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is the cost of proceeding without info high?" is HIGH VOI because YES → stop and research, NO → proceed and adapt. These are opposite immediate actions.

Information gaps and uncertainty determine whether you can make good decisions.
