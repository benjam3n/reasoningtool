## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q5: Is this decision reversible? (one-way vs two-way door)
2. Q4: What is the deadline? (urgency)
3. Q6: Who has authority? (who decides)
4. Q8: What decisions are pending? (what's blocked)
5. Q10: What is cost of delay? (urgency check)
6. Q11: What decisions are irreversible? (extra care needed)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: What decisions need to be made? (inventory)
8. Q2: What are available options? (option space)
9. Q3: What info needed to choose? (information needs)
10. Q9: What prevents pending decisions? (blockers)
11. Q12: What info before commitment? (preparation)
12. Q7: What influences decision-maker? (stakeholder approach)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Is this decision irreversible?" is HIGH VOI because YES → extra diligence and analysis, NO → decide quickly and adjust. These are fundamentally different decision-making modes.

Decision-making determines which path you take at each branch point.
