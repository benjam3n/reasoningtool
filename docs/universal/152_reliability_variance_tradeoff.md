## Core Insight

**Two sacks. Edgar chose the one that repairs itself (reliable, predictable). Gareth chose the one that transforms contents (unpredictable, high variance).**

Edgar had a fine journey. Gareth had an interesting one - gold stems, squirrels, foxes, people emerging from toys.

This is about the fundamental search tradeoff:
- **Reliability**: Known returns, predictable outcomes, safe
- **Variance**: Unknown returns, surprises possible, risky but potentially transformative

The question isn't which is "better" - it's which fits what you're optimizing for.

## Q1: What are you actually optimizing for?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong optimization target = wrong path choice]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Optimizing for safety but picking variance | HIGH | Unnecessary risk | Choose reliable path | Risk when you wanted safety |
| Optimizing for discovery but picking reliability | HIGH | Missing potential | Choose high-variance path | Safe when you wanted discovery |
| Unknown what optimizing for | MED | May mismatch | Clarify optimization target | Either direction wrong |
| Optimization target matched to path | LOW | Aligned | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q2: What's the cost of predictability here?

[VOI: HIGH - predictability has hidden costs]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High cost (missing transformative outcomes) | HIGH | Predictability costs too much | Accept variance | Miss the gold, the surprises |
| Low cost (not much upside in variance) | MED | Predictability is fine | Stay reliable | Unnecessary risk |
| Unknown cost | MED | May be undervaluing variance | Cost analysis | Either miss or risk |

---

## Q3: Can this path produce categorical surprises?

[VOI: HIGH - some paths can't produce category-crossing discoveries]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Path can produce categorical surprises | HIGH | Exploration potential | Worth the variance | Miss category-crossing discoveries |
| Path only produces same-type outputs | MED | Limited upside | Reliability may be fine | Expect surprises from predictable path |
| Unknown if categorical surprises possible | MED | May be missing | Possibility analysis | Either miss or expect wrongly |

---

## Q4: Is this a one-time or repeated choice?

[VOI: HIGH - repeated choices can absorb variance]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| One-time (can't recover from bad outcome) | HIGH | Variance is dangerous | Favor reliability | Bet everything, lose everything |
| Repeated (many chances, variance averages) | HIGH | Can absorb variance | Explore more freely | Too cautious when can recover |
| Unknown repetition | MED | May be wrong risk profile | Repetition analysis | Either direction wrong |

---

## Q5: What's the variance structure?

[VOI: MED - not all variance is equal]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Asymmetric upside (cap on downside, open upside) | MED | Variance is favorable | Embrace variance | Miss asymmetric opportunity |
| Asymmetric downside (cap on upside, open downside) | MED | Variance is unfavorable | Favor reliability | Take bad bets |
| Symmetric variance | LOW | Standard risk/reward | Normal analysis | Miss asymmetry |
| Unknown structure | MED | May be misjudging | Structure analysis | Wrong risk profile |

---

## Q6: How interesting does the journey need to be?

[VOI: MED - journey value vs destination value]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Journey matters (learning, experience, discovery) | MED | Variance enriches journey | Accept surprises | Boring reliable path when journey matters |
| Only destination matters | MED | Optimize for outcome | May favor reliability | Unnecessary journey risk |
| Unknown what matters | MED | May be wrong frame | Value analysis | Either direction wrong |

---

## Q7: Can you handle what emerges?

[VOI: MED - variance requires adaptation capacity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can adapt to surprises | MED | Variance is manageable | Explore | Surprised and can't cope |
| Cannot adapt to surprises | MED | Variance is dangerous | Stay reliable | Variance you can't handle |
| Unknown adaptation capacity | MED | May overestimate | Capacity check | Either direction wrong |

---

## Q8: Are you projecting constraints that don't exist?

[VOI: MED - false constraints limit search]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Projecting false constraints | MED | Limiting unnecessarily | Remove projected constraint | Act urgent when no urgency |
| Constraints are real | LOW | Work within them | Accept constraints | Ignore real constraints |
| Unknown if constraints are real | MED | May be self-limiting | Constraint test | Either limited or reckless |

---

## Q9: What would Gareth find that Edgar never could?

[VOI: LOW - helps evaluate variance value]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Significant exclusive discoveries | LOW | Variance has unique value | Consider variance path | Miss exclusive outcomes |
| No exclusive discoveries | LOW | Reliability loses nothing | Favor reliability | Unnecessary risk |
| Unknown exclusive potential | LOW | May be missing | Exclusive value analysis | Either miss or risk |

---

## Q10: Is "mellow about the process" available?

[VOI: LOW - adaptation strategy for variance]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can become mellow (handle emergence) | LOW | Variance manageable | Explore + adapt | Stress over surprises |
| Must predict/control | LOW | Variance costly | Favor reliability | Variance without coping |
| Unknown mellowness capacity | LOW | May misjudge | Capacity check | Either stressed or unaware |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: What optimizing for? - target
2. Q2: Cost of predictability? - hidden costs
3. Q3: Categorical surprises possible? - upside type
4. Q4: One-time or repeated? - risk absorption

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Variance structure? - asymmetry
6. Q6: Journey vs destination? - what matters
7. Q7: Can handle emergence? - adaptation
8. Q8: Projecting false constraints? - self-limiting

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Exclusive discoveries? - variance value
10. Q10: Mellowness available? - coping strategy

## Key Insight

**The question isn't "which sack is better?" It's "what are you optimizing for?"**

Edgar optimized for safety/reliability. He had a fine journey.
Gareth optimized for discovery/surprise. He had an interesting journey with gold, animals, people emerging from toys.

Neither is wrong. But choosing reliability when you want discovery (or vice versa) is a mismatch.

---

## The Sack Parable

**Edgar's sack** (self-repairing):
- Reliable, predictable
- He knows what he gets
- No surprises
- Safe journey

**Gareth's sack** (transforming):
- Unpredictable
- Flawed inputs → rotten outputs
- Quality inputs → surprisingly enhanced outputs
- Category-crossing: toys become people, apples get gold stems
- He "becomes mellow about the process" - handles emergence

**Edgar's error**: He also added a false constraint. His sack repairs, but he rushed as if damage was permanent. He projected urgency onto a system that didn't require it.

---

## Search Implications

| If You Want | Choose |
|-------------|--------|
| Known returns | Reliable path (Edgar's sack) |
| Potential for transformative discovery | High-variance path (Gareth's sack) |
| Safety | Reliability |
| Interesting journey | Variance |
| Predictable outcomes | Reliability |
| Category-crossing surprises | Variance |

**The trap**: Choosing reliability when what you actually want requires variance. Playing it safe when the interesting outcomes require risk.

**The move**: First clarify what you're optimizing for. Then choose the path that matches.
