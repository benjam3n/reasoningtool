## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Has this exact problem been solved before?

[VOI: HIGH - solved = copy; unsolved = create]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Solved, solution available | HIGH | Just copy | Apply existing solution | Reinvent wheel |
| Unknown if solved | MED | May be wasting | Prior solution search | Either reinvent or miss solution |
| Truly novel | HIGH | Must create | First-principles | Seek nonexistent solution |

---

## Q2: Is this genuinely novel or just feels novel?

[VOI: HIGH - false novelty = missed transfer opportunity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Feels novel, isn't | HIGH | Transfer applies | Find analogy | Solve what's already solved |
| Unknown if novel | MED | May miss transfer | Novelty verification | Either miss analogy or over-search |
| Genuinely novel | LOW | Must create | First-principles | Seek nonexistent precedent |

---

## Q3: Is there an analogous problem in a different domain?

[VOI: HIGH - cross-domain transfer often most valuable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Strong analogy exists | HIGH | Transfer solution | Apply with adaptation | Miss cross-domain insight |
| Unknown if analogy exists | MED | May miss | Analogy search | Either miss or waste search |
| No useful analogy | LOW | Domain-specific | Create from scratch | Seek nonexistent analogy |

---

## Q4: What's the transfer distance (how much adaptation needed)?

[VOI: HIGH - high transfer distance may mean analogy is false]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Transfer distance too high | HIGH | Analogy misleads | First-principles | Force bad analogy |
| Unknown transfer distance | MED | May misapply | Distance assessment | Either miss or misapply |
| Low transfer distance | LOW | Direct application | Apply with minor adapt | Treat as novel |

---

## Q5: Are the differences between this and prior cases critical?

[VOI: HIGH - critical differences = analogy fails]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Critical differences | HIGH | Analogy breaks | First-principles | Apply analogy that doesn't fit |
| Unknown if critical | MED | May misapply | Difference analysis | Either miss or misapply |
| Differences minor | LOW | Analogy holds | Transfer solution | Miss critical difference |

---

## Q6: Is there institutional/cultural knowledge about this?

[VOI: MED - tacit knowledge often valuable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tacit knowledge exists | MED | Go find experts | Seek tacit knowledge | Reinvent institutional wisdom |
| Unknown if exists | MED | May miss | Knowledge search | Either miss or waste search |
| No institutional knowledge | LOW | Must create | Generate from scratch | Seek nonexistent expertise |

---

## Q7: Are there documented failures to learn from?

[VOI: MED - negative precedent often more valuable]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Failures documented | MED | Learn what not to do | Study failures | Repeat known failures |
| Unknown if failures exist | MED | May repeat mistakes | Failure search | Either repeat or paranoid |
| No documented failures | LOW | Less guidance | Proceed cautiously | Expect guidance that doesn't exist |

---

## Q8: Is "not invented here" blocking transfer?

[VOI: MED - NIH syndrome wastes effort]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| NIH blocking transfer | MED | Pride over efficiency | Override NIH | Reinvent for ego |
| Unknown if NIH factor | MED | May be blocked | NIH check | Either blocked or paranoid |
| Transfer accepted | LOW | No ego barrier | Transfer freely | Actually NIH blocking |

---

## Q9: What's the adaptation cost vs creation cost?

[VOI: LOW - cost comparison but similar decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Adaptation cheaper | LOW | Transfer efficient | Adapt existing | Create when could adapt |
| Unknown costs | LOW | May misallocate | Cost comparison | Either over-create or over-adapt |
| Creation cheaper | LOW | Transfer inefficient | Create fresh | Adapt when create cheaper |

---

## Q10: Is the prior solution still current?

[VOI: LOW - currency check but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Solution outdated | LOW | Update needed | Adapt or recreate | Apply stale solution |
| Unknown currency | LOW | May misapply | Currency check | Either apply stale or miss good |
| Solution current | LOW | Direct application | Apply | Apply outdated thinking |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Solved before? - copy vs create
2. Q2: Genuinely novel? - false novelty
3. Q3: Cross-domain analogy? - transfer opportunity
4. Q4: Transfer distance? - adaptation needed
5. Q5: Critical differences? - analogy validity

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Institutional knowledge? - tacit expertise
7. Q7: Documented failures? - negative precedent
8. Q8: NIH blocking? - ego barrier

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Adaptation vs creation cost? - efficiency
10. Q10: Solution current? - freshness

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ intellectual originality. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the prior solution current?" is a useful check but has LOW VOI - you do similar verification regardless.

"Has this been solved before?" has HIGH VOI - if yes, stop creating and start copying.

## The Novelty Illusion

Most problems that feel novel aren't. They're:
- Old problems in new contexts
- Old problems with new terminology
- Old problems you haven't studied yet

Before treating anything as novel:
1. Search same domain for direct precedent
2. Search adjacent domains for analogies
3. Search distant domains for structural matches
4. Only then: accept as genuinely novel

The meta-insight: Novely detection is usually just limited search. Expand your search before concluding something is new.

Time spent finding existing solutions almost always beats time spent creating new ones.
