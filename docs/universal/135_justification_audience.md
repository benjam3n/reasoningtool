## Q6: What is the audience's expertise level?

[VOI: MED - affects explanation depth]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overestimating expertise | MED | Lost audience | Simplify | Audience confused |
| Underestimating expertise | MED | Wasting time | Speed up | Audience bored |
| Unknown expertise | MED | May mismatch | Expertise assessment | Either confuse or bore |
| Expertise matched | LOW | Appropriate depth | Continue | Actually mismatched |

## Q7: Does the audience have skin in the game?

[VOI: MED - affects their scrutiny level]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| They have stakes, we forgot | MED | Underestimating scrutiny | Expect harder scrutiny | Unprepared for pushback |
| They don't have stakes, we assumed | MED | Over-preparing | Simplify | Wasted defensive effort |
| Unknown stake level | MED | May mismatch | Stake analysis | Either under or over prepare |
| Stakes understood | LOW | Appropriate preparation | Continue | Actually misunderstood |

---

## Q8: What frame is the audience operating in?

[VOI: MED - must work within or change their frame]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Frame unknown | MED | May clash | Frame analysis | Clash with their frame |
| Frame different than ours | MED | Need frame bridging | Build frame bridge | Talk past each other |
| Frame same as ours | LOW | Direct communication | Proceed | Actually different frame |

---

## Q9: What is the audience's decision timeline?

[VOI: LOW - affects timing but similar content]

| Immediate decision needed | LOW | Compress | Compress argument | Too slow |
| Extended timeline | LOW | Can build carefully | Build comprehensively | Rushed unnecessarily |
| Unknown timeline | LOW | May mismatch | Timeline check | Either rushed or slow |
| Timeline matched | LOW | Appropriate pacing | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q10: Will the reasoning be transmitted to others?

[VOI: LOW - affects simplicity but similar core]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Will be retold | LOW | Must be retellable | Make memorable | Lost in transmission |
| Won't be retold | LOW | Can be complex | Full complexity ok | Simplified unnecessarily |
| Unknown transmission | LOW | May need simplicity | Assume transmission | Either complex or simple |
| Transmission matched | LOW | Appropriate complexity | Continue | Actually wrong |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Who decides? - right target
2. Q2: Self or others? - justification level
3. Q3: Friendly or hostile? - defense level
4. Q4: What do they believe? - bridging
5. Q5: What's credible to them? - evidence selection

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Expertise level? - explanation depth
7. Q7: Skin in game? - scrutiny level
8. Q8: Their frame? - frame bridging

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Decision timeline? - pacing
10. Q10: Will be retold? - simplicity

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ rhetorical sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Will the reasoning be transmitted to others?" affects style but has LOW VOI - core reasoning similar.

"Who is the actual decision-maker?" has HIGH VOI - persuading the wrong person is completely wasted effort.

## Audience Determines Validity

The Enigma of Reason insight: Reasoning evolved for social justification, not solitary truth-seeking.

**Implications:**
- "Valid" reasoning depends on who must accept it
- Evidence credibility is audience-relative
- Argument structure must bridge from their beliefs
- Hostile audiences require anticipating objections

**The trap:** Reasoning for ourselves and assuming it works for others.

**The move:** Before constructing an argument, ask "Who needs to accept this, and what would convince THEM?"
