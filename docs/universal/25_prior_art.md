## Q8: What information do practitioners know that is not written down?
[VOI: HIGH - significant tacit knowledge means missing critical info without access to practitioners]

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q11: What characteristics disqualify? (am I even qualified?)
2. Q12: Which disqualifiers apply to me? (should I proceed?)
3. Q3: What methods are documented? (is there a known path?)
4. Q9: Who achieved this from similar conditions? (model to follow)
5. Q10: Who failed from similar conditions? (what to avoid)
6. Q8: What tacit knowledge exists? (missing critical info?)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q1: What is precise success definition? (what are we targeting)
8. Q2: What conditions must be met? (success criteria)
9. Q7: What documentation exists? (knowledge sources)
10. Q4: What is success rate of each method? (method reliability)
11. Q5: How does each method fail? (risk preparation)
12. Q6: What methods were abandoned? (what to avoid)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Am I disqualified?" is HIGH VOI because YES → pursue different goal, NO → proceed with this goal. These are completely different directions.

Prior art analysis helps you avoid reinventing the wheel and learn from others' successes and failures.
