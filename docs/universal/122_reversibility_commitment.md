## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Is this decision reversible or irreversible?

[VOI: HIGH - irreversible requires much more careful analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Irreversible | HIGH | One-way door | Maximum analysis before committing | Commit carelessly, permanent regret |
| Unknown reversibility | MED | May be stuck | Reversibility analysis | Either over-analyze or under-analyze |
| Easily reversible | LOW | Can undo | Move fast, learn | Over-analyze reversible decision |

---

## Q2: What's the cost of reversal if we need to undo?

[VOI: HIGH - high reversal cost = treat as irreversible]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Reversal cost > original cost | HIGH | Effectively irreversible | Treat as one-way | Commit then pay huge reversal |
| Unknown reversal cost | MED | May be trapped | Cost analysis | Trapped by unexpected cost |
| Low reversal cost | LOW | True optionality | Move fast | Underestimate reversal cost |

---

## Q3: Is there path dependence (order matters)?

[VOI: HIGH - path dependence means early decisions constrain later ones]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Strong path dependence | HIGH | Early choices lock-in | Choose early carefully | Locked into bad path |
| Unknown path dependence | MED | May be constrained | Dependence analysis | Either constrained or over-cautious |
| Path independent | LOW | Order doesn't matter | Flexible sequencing | Miss that order matters |

---

## Q4: Are we preserving or destroying options?

[VOI: HIGH - destroyed options can't be recovered]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Destroying valuable options | HIGH | Losing future flexibility | Preserve or accept loss | Destroy options carelessly |
| Unknown option impact | MED | May be destroying | Option analysis | Unknowingly destroy options |
| Preserving options | LOW | Maintaining flexibility | Proceed | Actually destroying options |

---

## Q5: Is there lock-in risk (switching costs grow over time)?

[VOI: HIGH - lock-in makes future switching prohibitive]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Lock-in risk high | HIGH | Switching becomes impossible | Choose carefully or plan exit | Locked into bad choice |
| Unknown lock-in | MED | May be trapped | Lock-in analysis | Trapped unexpectedly |
| No lock-in | LOW | Can switch freely | Less analysis needed | Actually locked in |

---

## Q6: What's the commitment horizon?

[VOI: MED - affects analysis depth but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Long-term commitment | MED | Years/decades | Deep analysis | Under-analyze long commitment |
| Unknown horizon | MED | May mismatch | Horizon clarification | Either over or under analyze |
| Short-term commitment | LOW | Days/weeks | Quick analysis | Over-analyze short commitment |

---

## Q7: Can we make the decision reversible?

[VOI: MED - affects design but similar decision process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Could add reversibility | MED | Design opportunity | Add escape hatch | Miss reversibility option |
| Unknown if possible | MED | May miss opportunity | Reversibility design | Either miss or waste effort |
| Can't add reversibility | LOW | Accept as one-way | Full analysis | Seek impossible reversibility |

---

## Q8: What are the switching costs?

[VOI: MED - affects lock-in calculation but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| High switching costs | MED | Pseudo-irreversible | Treat as committed | Underestimate switching pain |
| Unknown switching costs | MED | May be trapped | Cost analysis | Surprised by switching cost |
| Low switching costs | LOW | Real optionality | Flexible | Overestimate switching ease |

---

## Q9: Is sunk cost affecting our reversal judgment?

[VOI: LOW - bias check but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sunk cost biasing | LOW | Irrational continuation | Ignore sunk costs | Continue bad path |
| Unknown if biased | LOW | May be irrational | Bias check | Unknowingly biased |
| Not biased by sunk cost | LOW | Rational evaluation | Trust analysis | Actually biased |

---

## Q10: Do stakeholders perceive this as reversible?

[VOI: LOW - affects communication but similar decision]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Stakeholders think permanent | LOW | Communication issue | Clarify reversibility | Unnecessary anxiety |
| Unknown perception | LOW | May cause confusion | Perception check | Stakeholder surprise |
| Stakeholders understand reversibility | LOW | Aligned | Proceed | Actually misperceived |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Reversible? - one-way vs two-way door
2. Q2: Reversal cost? - effective reversibility
3. Q3: Path dependence? - early choice lock-in
4. Q4: Preserving options? - future flexibility
5. Q5: Lock-in risk? - switching cost growth

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Commitment horizon? - time scale
7. Q7: Can add reversibility? - design opportunity
8. Q8: Switching costs? - lock-in details

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Sunk cost bias? - bias check
10. Q10: Stakeholder perception? - communication

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ decision-theoretic elegance. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is sunk cost affecting judgment?" is a useful bias check but has LOW VOI - you do similar analysis either way.

"Is this decision reversible?" has HIGH VOI - reversible decisions get quick exploration, irreversible get exhaustive analysis.

## The Two-Door Framework (Jeff Bezos)

**Type 1 decisions** (one-way doors): Irreversible or nearly so. Require careful analysis, consultation, deliberation.

**Type 2 decisions** (two-way doors): Reversible. Should be made quickly by individuals or small groups.

Most decisions are Type 2, but organizations often treat them as Type 1, creating unnecessary slowness.

The meta-move: Before analyzing the decision, analyze whether it's Type 1 or Type 2.
