## Q6: Is this reason stable or changing?
[VOI: HIGH - volatile = can't plan for this]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

| Unknown stability | LOW | Assume stable until proven otherwise | Monitor for changes | Stability is known |

---

## Q7: What is the stated reason?
[VOI: HIGH - no stated reason = can't proceed]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No stated reason | HIGH | Can't proceed without understanding why | Elicitation needed | Reason is known |
| Clear stated reason exists | MED | Have something to work with, may or may not be actual | Work from stated | Need to elicit |
| Vague stated reason | MED | Have direction, needs clarification | Clarify vagueness | Stated is clear |
| Contradictory stated reasons | MED | Conflict resolution needed | Resolve contradiction | Reasons are coherent |
| Multiple stated reasons | LOW | Just need to handle plurality | Prioritize among them | Single reason |

---

## Q8: What trade-offs does this reason imply?
[VOI: HIGH - self vs others trade-off = whose benefit wins]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Self vs others trade-off | HIGH | Whose benefit wins | Resolve fairly | No self/other tension |
| Time vs quality trade-off | MED | Classic trade-off | Make the trade-off | No time pressure |
| Cost vs benefit trade-off | MED | Resource allocation | Optimize allocation | Resources not limited |
| Now vs later trade-off | MED | Temporal preference | Understand preference | No temporal tension |
| Unknown trade-offs | MED | Discovery needed | Trade-off analysis | Trade-offs known |
| No trade-offs | LOW | Simpler situation | Proceed simply | Trade-offs exist |

---

## Q9: What is the ultimate reason behind this reason?
[VOI: MED - chain depth affects approach]

| Guess | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Many levels deeper | MED | More elicitation needed | Continue chain | Closer to terminal |
| This is the terminal reason | MED | Can stop asking why | This is intrinsic | Deeper reason exists |
| One level deeper exists | LOW | Need one more "why" | Continue asking | At terminal |
| Circular (loops back) | LOW | Hit fundamental value | Accept as terminal | Not circular yet |
| Unknown depth | LOW | Keep asking until circular | Continue elicitation | Depth is known |

## Q10: Is this reason shared with others?

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q7** (Stated reason exists?) - need something to work with
2. **Q1** (Is stated = actual?) - proxy/rationalization detection
3. **Q3** (Stakes) - nothing vs severe
4. **Q4** (Whose reason) - imposed vs intrinsic
5. **Q5** (Satisfaction criteria) - know when done
6. **Q2** (Category) - survival/avoidance vs growth
7. **Q6** (Stability) - volatile?
8. **Q8** (Trade-offs) - self vs others?
9. **Q9-Q10** (Details)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is the stated reason actually a rationalization?" routes to deeper discovery vs taking at face value. "Is this a survival need?" routes to crisis response vs opportunity pursuit.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
