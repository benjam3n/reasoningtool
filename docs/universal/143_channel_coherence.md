# Universal: Channel Coherence (143)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Core Insight

**Communication happens across multiple channels simultaneously. Coherence across channels amplifies; conflict across channels cancels.**

Channels include:
- Words (semantic content)
- Vocal tone, tempo, pitch, timbre, volume
- Facial expression
- Body posture and gesture
- Breathing rhythm
- Eye contact and direction
- Physical proximity and touch

**Internal Alignment** = all YOUR channels sending the same message
**External Alignment** = your channels matching the OTHER person's state

The Gut (emotional/instinctive mind) reads all channels simultaneously. Misalignment triggers distrust even when the Head (analytical mind) can't identify why.

## Q1: Are our channels aligned or conflicting?

[VOI: HIGH - conflicting channels cancel the message]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Channels conflicting | HIGH | Message cancels itself | Align channels | Words land, meaning doesn't |
| Unknown channel state | MED | May be canceling | Channel audit | Either aligned or conflicting |
| Channels aligned | LOW | Message amplifies | Continue | Actually conflicting |

---

## Q2: Which channel is dominant here?

[VOI: HIGH - dominant channel determines interpretation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Words dominant | MED | Logic matters most | Optimize verbal content | Wrong channel focus |
| Tone/delivery dominant | HIGH | How > what | Optimize delivery | Perfect words, wrong tone |
| Nonverbal dominant | HIGH | Body language rules | Optimize nonverbal | Words ignored |
| Unknown which dominant | MED | May be wrong focus | Dominance analysis | Either verbal or nonverbal |

---

## Q3: Is there a channel mismatch we're not seeing?

[VOI: HIGH - hidden mismatch creates unexplained failure]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Hidden mismatch present | HIGH | Unexplained resistance | Find and fix mismatch | Message fails mysteriously |
| Unknown if mismatch | MED | May have hidden conflict | Systematic channel check | Either clean or conflicting |
| No hidden mismatch | LOW | Clean signal | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q4: Are we matching their channel state?

[VOI: HIGH - mismatch creates distance, match creates rapport]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Mismatched from them | HIGH | Distance/distrust | Create External Alignment | Technically right, emotionally rejected |
| Unknown match level | MED | May be creating distance | Match analysis | Either close or distant |
| Matched to them | LOW | Rapport established | Maintain or lead | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q5: Can we lead their channels once matched?

[VOI: MED - leading enables state change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can lead but not trying | MED | Missed influence opportunity | Match then lead | Stay matched, no change |
| Unknown if can lead | MED | May be able to shift them | Lead test (subtle) | Either lead or follow |
| Cannot lead (they lead) | LOW | Must follow their lead | Adapt to them | Try to lead, create conflict |

---

## Q6: Is the receiver in analytical or receptive state?

[VOI: MED - state determines what channels work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Analytical state (Head) | MED | Logic channels work | Use verbal, logical | Emotional approach bounces |
| Unknown state | MED | May be using wrong approach | State diagnosis | Either Head or Gut |
| Receptive state (Gut/Alpha) | MED | Emotional channels work | Use nonverbal, experiential | Logical approach disrupts |

---

## Q7: Are any channels at extreme settings?

[VOI: MED - extremes have more impact but can overwhelm]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| All channels moderate (3-5) | LOW | Normal impact | Increase for more impact | Flat, unmemorable |
| Some channels extreme (1-10) | MED | Charismatic impact | Use strategically | Overwhelming or jarring |
| Unknown channel settings | MED | May be flat or extreme | Channel audit | Either adjust or maintain |

---

## Q8: Is there channel capacity being wasted?

[VOI: LOW - affects efficiency but similar message]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Channels underutilized | LOW | Missing amplification | Activate more channels | Leave impact on table |
| Unknown utilization | LOW | May be missing some | Utilization check | Either full or partial |
| All channels utilized | LOW | Full bandwidth | Maintain | Actually underutilized |

---

## Q9: Is channel noise interfering?

[VOI: LOW - affects clarity but similar core work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Environmental noise | LOW | Reduces signal | Reduce noise or increase signal | Weak signal, unclear message |
| Unknown noise level | LOW | May have interference | Noise check | Either clean or noisy |
| Clean channel | LOW | Signal clear | Continue | Actually noisy |

---

## Q10: Do we need all channels or just key ones?

[VOI: LOW - affects approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Key channels sufficient | LOW | Can focus | Optimize key channels | Over-optimize minor |
| All channels needed | LOW | Must coordinate all | Full channel management | Neglect important channel |
| Unknown requirements | LOW | May be over/under | Requirement analysis | Either focused or broad |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Channels aligned? - cancellation risk
2. Q2: Which channel dominant? - focus
3. Q3: Hidden mismatch? - mysterious failure
4. Q4: Matching their state? - rapport

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Can we lead? - influence
6. Q6: Analytical or receptive? - approach type
7. Q7: Extreme settings? - impact level

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Channels underutilized? - efficiency
9. Q9: Channel noise? - clarity
10. Q10: All channels needed? - scope

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ communication sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is there channel noise interfering?" is practical but has LOW VOI - you increase signal either way.

"Are our channels aligned or conflicting?" has HIGH VOI - conflicting channels mean your message cancels itself no matter how good the content.

## The Alignment Principle

From Fuentes:

**Internal Alignment**: All your outputs agree with each other
- Facial expression matches words
- Posture matches words
- Voice pitch matches words
- Gestures match words

Violation examples:
- Blank expression while saying "I love this"
- Rising pitch (uncertainty) while making assertion
- Shaking head while saying "Yes"
- Folded arms while saying "I'm open to this"

**External Alignment**: Your outputs match their state
- Similar posture (postural echo)
- Similar breathing rhythm
- Similar speaking tempo
- Saying things they already believe (Verbal Matching)

**The sequence**: External Alignment first (build rapport) → Internal Alignment when delivering message (maximize impact)

**The trap:** Perfect content with conflicting delivery. The Gut reads ALL channels. "I don't know why, but something feels off" = channel mismatch detected.

**The move:** Before any important communication, audit your channels. Are they all sending the same message? Are you matched to the receiver? Then deliver with full Internal Alignment.

## Channel Dial Settings

Think of each channel as having a dial from 1-10:

- Most people operate at 3-5 (moderate)
- Charismatic people use the full range (1-10)
- Going to extremes (1 or 10) creates impact
- Staying moderate creates flatness

**Tempo**: Slow (1) = emotional intensity, Fast (10) = excitement/nervousness
**Pitch**: Low (1) = certainty/power, High (10) = uncertainty/question
**Volume**: Quiet (1) = intimacy/gravity, Loud (10) = energy/urgency
**Gesture space**: Constrained (1) = caution, Expansive (10) = confidence

The more emotion you exhibit, the more emotion you elicit.
