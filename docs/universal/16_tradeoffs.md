**Category**: STRATEGY - Trade-offs
**Source**: [D: CORE DIMENSIONS - Tradeoffs (what must be sacrificed)]
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths (like phone tree routing to different departments)
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: Are trade-offs hidden or explicit?
[VOI: HIGH - hidden trade-offs → surface hidden; explicit → address directly; completely different action paths]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Hidden (unstated) | HIGH | Surface hidden vs direct address | Surface hidden | All are explicit |
| Mix of both | MED | Partial visibility approach | Surface hidden | All explicit or hidden |
| Explicit (stated) | LOW | Standard handling | Address stated | Hidden trade-offs |
| Unknown if hidden | MED | Investigation vs direct | Hidden trade-off search | Visibility known |

---

## Q2: Can the trade-off be resolved (have both)?
[VOI: HIGH - yes can have both → find resolution (no trade-off); no → must choose; completely different paths]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, can have both | HIGH | Find resolution vs accept trade-off | Find resolution | Trade-off is real |
| Partially resolvable | MED | Reduce vs accept | Seek partial resolution | Fully resolvable or not |
| No, fundamental | MED | Accept and choose | Accept and choose | Resolution possible |
| Unknown if resolvable | MED | Explore vs proceed | Resolution search | Resolution known |

---

## Q3: How reversible is the trade-off choice?
[VOI: HIGH - irreversible → maximum analysis before choosing; reversible → choose and adjust; different paths]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Irreversible | HIGH | Maximum analysis vs quick choice | Maximum analysis | Actually reversible |
| Partially reversible | MED | Choose carefully vs adjust later | Choose carefully | More or less reversible |
| Fully reversible | LOW | Standard choosing | Choose and adjust | Not reversible |
| Unknown reversibility | MED | Determine first vs proceed | Reversibility analysis | Reversibility known |

---

## Q4: Do trade-offs actually exist?
[VOI: HIGH - no trade-offs → proceed simply (rare, verify); yes → manage trade-offs; different action paths]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No trade-offs (can have all) | HIGH | Proceed simply vs manage trade-offs | Proceed simply | Trade-offs exist |
| Unknown if trade-offs | MED | Analysis vs proceed | Trade-off analysis | Trade-offs known |
| Yes, trade-offs exist | LOW | Standard situation | Manage trade-offs | Can have all |

---

## Q5: What is the primary trade-off?
[VOI: HIGH for value trade-offs (risk/reward, short/long, self/others) → changes strategy; MED for classic operational trade-offs]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Risk vs Reward | HIGH | Stakes-aware vs standard | Balance risk/reward | Different trade-off |
| Short-term vs Long-term | HIGH | Temporal strategy | Balance horizons | Different trade-off |
| Self vs Others | HIGH | Value negotiation | Balance interests | Different trade-off |
| Time vs Quality | MED | Classic operational | Balance time/quality | Different trade-off |
| Cost vs Quality | MED | Classic operational | Balance cost/quality | Different trade-off |
| Time vs Cost | MED | Classic operational | Balance time/cost | Different trade-off |
| Scope vs Resources | MED | Classic operational | Balance scope/resources | Different trade-off |
| Unknown primary | MED | Discovery needed | Trade-off discovery | Trade-off known |

---

## Q6: Who bears each side of the trade-off?
[VOI: HIGH for unfair distribution → renegotiate; MED for balanced distribution]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| You bear cost, others benefit | HIGH | Renegotiate vs accept | Renegotiate or accept | More balanced |
| Others bear cost, you benefit | HIGH | Consider fairness vs proceed | Consider fairness | More balanced |
| You bear both sides | MED | Self-balance decision | Self-balance | Others involved |
| Unknown distribution | MED | Analysis needed | Distribution analysis | Distribution known |
| Evenly distributed | LOW | Accept and proceed | Accept distribution | Uneven |

---

## Q7: What is the exchange rate?
[VOI: HIGH for accelerating (extreme consequences) → avoid extremes; MED for diminishing → find sweet spot]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Non-linear (accelerating) | HIGH | Avoid extremes | Avoid extremes | Linear or diminishing |
| Non-linear (diminishing) | MED | Find optimal point | Find sweet spot | Linear |
| Unknown rate | MED | Analysis needed | Rate analysis | Rate known |
| 1:1 exchange | LOW | Standard trading | Standard trade | Non-linear |

---

## Q8: What would change the optimal balance?
[VOI: HIGH for new information → monitor actively; MED for context/time changes]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| New information | HIGH | Monitor actively vs set fixed | Monitor for info | Info stable |
| Context changes | MED | Situational adaptation | Adapt to context | Context stable |
| Time changes | MED | Periodic revisit | Revisit periodically | Time stable |
| Unknown dynamics | MED | Monitoring system | Dynamic monitoring | Dynamics known |
| Nothing (stable) | LOW | Fixed balance | Set and proceed | Actually dynamic |

---

## Q9: Which side is currently favored?
[VOI: MED - direction matters but doesn't change fundamental approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Favor side A strongly | MED | May need rebalancing | Consider rebalancing | More balanced |
| Favor side A slightly | LOW | Minor adjustment | Accept or adjust | Different balance |
| Balanced | LOW | No change needed | Maintain balance | Favoring one side |
| Unknown current balance | LOW | Assessment needed | Balance assessment | Balance known |

---

## Q10: What are the second-order trade-offs?
[VOI: MED - adds complexity but same direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Secondary trade-offs exist | MED | More complexity | Address secondary too | No secondary |
| No secondary trade-offs | LOW | Simple situation | Handle primary | Secondary exists |
| Unknown if secondary | LOW | Worth checking | Secondary search | Secondary known |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

1. **Q3: Reversibility** (HIGH) - One-way door changes everything
2. **Q1: Hidden vs Explicit** (HIGH) - Surface hidden trade-offs first
3. **Q2: Resolvable** (HIGH) - Can we avoid the trade-off entirely
4. **Q4: Exist** (HIGH for "no") - Verify trade-offs are real
5. **Q5: Primary trade-off** (HIGH for value trade-offs) - What are we actually trading
6. **Q6: Distribution** (HIGH for unfair) - Who bears what
7. **Q7: Exchange rate** (HIGH for accelerating) - Non-linear consequences
8. **Q8: Dynamics** (HIGH for new info) - What would change balance
9. **Q9-Q10: Balance and Secondary** (MED/LOW) - Details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**
**VOI = Action Divergence**

A trade-off being "important" doesn't make it HIGH-VOI. The question is: does knowing the answer change what you DO?

- Irreversibility is HIGH-VOI because reversible → iterate; irreversible → analyze heavily
- Hidden trade-offs are HIGH-VOI because hidden → surface them; explicit → address directly
- Current balance is LOW-VOI because knowing the balance doesn't change fundamental approach
