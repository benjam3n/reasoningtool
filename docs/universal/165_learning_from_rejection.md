## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Rejection is information. When a candidate fails or is blocked, that reveals a constraint not in the original problem specification.**

Types of rejection:
- **Objection**: "This won't work" / "I can't do this" / "That's not acceptable"
- **Obstacle**: Something prevents progress toward a candidate
- **Failure**: Candidate was tried and didn't work

All three reveal the same thing: a constraint that wasn't accounted for.

## Q1: What constraint does this rejection reveal?

[VOI: HIGH - rejection = constraint information]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Constraint not identified | HIGH | Fighting against unknown constraint | Identify the constraint | Keep hitting same wall |
| Constraint identified | MED | Can incorporate or address | Add to problem specification | Actually wrong constraint |

---

## Q2: Was this constraint in the original problem specification?

[VOI: HIGH - missing constraint = incomplete problem]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, missing | HIGH | Problem was incomplete | Add constraint, re-search | Keep finding rejected candidates |
| Yes, present | MED | Constraint was known but not satisfied | Satisfy constraint | Actually missing |

---

## Q3: Is this a hard constraint or soft preference?

[VOI: HIGH - different treatment required]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Hard (must satisfy) | HIGH | Cannot violate | Find candidates that satisfy | Waste effort on impossible |
| Soft (prefer to satisfy) | MED | Can trade off | Consider trade-offs | Treat soft as hard |

---

## Q4: What benefit does the current state provide?

[VOI: HIGH - hidden benefit = hidden constraint]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Benefit not identified | HIGH | Will revert | Identify the benefit | Change then lose it, revert |
| Benefit identified | MED | Can preserve benefit | Find alternative way to get it | Actually wrong benefit |

---

## Q5: Is the rejection about content or about something else?

[VOI: HIGH - different objection types need different response]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| About content (practical) | MED | Address the content | Fix the practical issue | Miss deeper issue |
| About values (principle) | HIGH | Must respect principle | Honor the value | Argue content, miss point |
| About identity (who I am) | HIGH | Must respect self-concept | Work with identity | Trigger defense |

---

## Q6: What is generating the rejection?

[VOI: MED - source identification enables resolution]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Source not identified | MED | Cannot address | Identify source | Keep fighting phantom |
| Source identified | LOW | Can address its needs | Address source | Actually different source |

---

## Q7: Can the constraint be satisfied differently?

[VOI: MED - alternative satisfaction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes | MED | Alternative exists | Find alternative | Keep current approach unnecessarily |
| No | MED | Must accept constraint | Accept and work within | Miss alternative |

---

## Q8: Is the rejection protecting something?

[VOI: MED - protection function]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes | MED | Must honor protection | Protect AND achieve goal | Threaten protected thing |
| No | LOW | Direct resolution | Proceed | Miss protection function |

---

## Q9: Does the rejection contain its solution?

[VOI: LOW - embedded solution]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes ("I would if...") | LOW | Solution stated | Meet stated condition | Miss easy path |
| No | LOW | Need to generate solution | Create solution | Think embedded when not |

---

## Q10: What pattern do repeated rejections reveal?

[VOI: LOW - pattern = meta-information]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Systematic pattern | LOW | Address pattern level | Work at pattern level | Keep addressing instances |
| No pattern | LOW | Individual rejections | Address individually | Miss pattern |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: What constraint does this rejection reveal?
2. Q2: Was this constraint in the original problem specification?
3. Q3: Is this a hard constraint or soft preference?
4. Q4: What benefit does the current state provide?
5. Q5: Is the rejection about content, values, or identity?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: What is generating the rejection?
7. Q7: Can the constraint be satisfied differently?
8. Q8: Is the rejection protecting something?

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Does the rejection contain its solution?
10. Q10: What pattern do repeated rejections reveal?

## The Information Value of Rejection

```
Rejection says: "Your problem specification is missing something."

OBJECTION: "This won't work"
→ Reveals: A constraint the proposer didn't know about

OBSTACLE: Something blocks progress
→ Reveals: A need the plan doesn't satisfy

FAILURE: Candidate tried, didn't work
→ Reveals: Reality doesn't match model

All three → UPDATE THE PROBLEM SPECIFICATION
```

## Response Shift

| Surface Response | Information Response |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "But it's not risky because..." | "What would make this feel safe enough?" |
| "Why won't you try?" | "What would need to be true for this to work?" |
| "You're being unreasonable" | "What constraint am I missing?" |

The surface response argues. The information response learns.

---

## Hidden Benefits (Secondary Gain)

When change is resisted despite stated desire, look for hidden benefits:

| Behavior | Stated Goal | Hidden Benefit |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Procrastination | Be productive | Avoid failure by not trying |
| Illness | Get healthy | Receive care |
| Failure | Succeed | Avoid expectations |

The behavior that seems "bad" is serving a function. That function is a constraint.

---

## The Three Requirements for Change

Change requires:
1. **Want to do it** - No hidden benefit opposing
2. **Know how to do it** - Method exists
3. **Have the chance to do it** - Resources/access available

Rejection can block any of these:
- "Won't": Something benefits from status quo
- "Can't how": No known method
- "Can't when": No opportunity

Identify which is blocked.

## Common Patterns

| Rejection Pattern | What It Reveals | Response |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Same objection repeatedly | Core constraint being ignored | Honor the constraint |
| "Yes but" pattern | Hidden constraint | Find what "but" protects |
| Sudden confusion | Approaching protected area | Persist gently |
| Strong emotional response | Values/identity involved | Shift from content to values |
| Passive resistance | Unstated disagreement | Surface the disagreement |
