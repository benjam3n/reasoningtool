## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: Purpose? Audience? - why and for whom determines everything
- Q3-Q5: Structure? Order? Complete? - content organization
- Q6: Accurate? - credibility foundation

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q7-Q9: Knowledge level, vocabulary, clarity - calibration
- Q10-Q11: Excess, simplicity - polish

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ writing quality importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (define audience vs write generic, create structure vs proceed, fix errors vs publish). Low VOI questions polish writing within an established direction.
