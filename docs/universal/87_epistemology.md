| Diverse information sources | LOW | Exposure to contrary, continue | Continue | Confident but filtered |

---

## Q8: What's our confidence calibration?
[VOI: HIGH - overconfident means will be surprised vs calibrated enables appropriate confidence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overconfident | HIGH | Widen confidence intervals vs trust | Widen confidence intervals | Chronic surprise, don't learn |

---

## Q9: Is this knowledge or belief?

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 11
ENTRIES: 46

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 14 entries (30%)
- MED: 21 entries (46%)
- LOW: 11 entries (24%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because epistemological errors undermine all other reasoning

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1: How do we know? - basis for belief
- Q2: Evidence quality? - strength of basis
- Q5: Assumptions? - hidden beliefs
- Q8-Q9: Calibration? Knowledge vs belief? - certainty appropriate
- Q3-Q4, Q6-Q7, Q10-Q11: Falsification, causation, deception, bubbles, maps, humility

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Follow-up verification and calibration questions

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth or epistemological sophistication**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (verify vs accept authority, gather evidence vs act on speculation, surface assumptions vs proceed blind). Low VOI questions refine epistemic status within an established confidence level.
