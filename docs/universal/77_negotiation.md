## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1: BATNA - weak/unknown changes negotiation posture entirely
- Q2: ZOPA - no ZOPA means walk away or create
- Q3: Interests - assumed/unknown leads to position-only negotiation
- Q4: Hidden parties - decisions can be overturned
- Q5: Hidden positions - blind negotiation vs informed
- Q6: Vague commitments - unenforceable deals
- Q7: Not capable - empty promises

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q8-Q11: Shared interests, conflict type, their BATNA, ZOPA position

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ deal value or relationship importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (walk away vs negotiate, verify vs trust, find parties vs proceed). Low VOI questions are about optimization within an established negotiation approach.
