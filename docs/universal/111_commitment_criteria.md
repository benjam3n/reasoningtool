# Universal: Commitment Criteria (111)

**Category**: META - What Can Actually Be Committed To
**Source**: [D: from analysis of arbitrary vs necessary commitments]
**Structure**: One question per entry, CRUX-marked with realistic distribution
**Purpose**: Prevent arbitrary commitments that narrow options prematurely

## The Problem

The commitment tree (110) would commit too easily. Most "commitments" are actually:
- Frame choices (could be stated differently)
- Interpretations (depend on definitions)
- Preferences (value-laden)
- Opinions (subjective)

**Only commit to what CANNOT BE COHERENTLY DENIED BY LOGIC ITSELF.**

Everything else stays OPEN - even if "most people would agree."

## Agreeability Spectrum

```
Level 1: LOGICALLY NECESSARY
         "Reality exists", "A=A", "Something cannot be and not-be simultaneously"
         → CAN COMMIT: Cannot be coherently denied

Level 2: OBSERVATIONALLY GIVEN (frame-dependent)
         "We are in a room"
         → CAREFUL: True, but "we are in a house" also true
         → Frame choice, not commitment

Level 3: INTERPRETIVELY SHARED
         "We've been here a while"
         → CANNOT COMMIT: "A while" is subjective
         → Could disagree on definition

Level 4: PREFERENTIALLY COMMON
         "Making money is good"
         → CANNOT COMMIT: Value-laden
         → Many agree but disagreement is coherent

Level 5: OPINION
         "Dropshipping is better than starting a business"
         → CANNOT COMMIT: Arbitrary preference
         → No logical necessity
```

## The Test

For any statement, ask:
1. Can someone COHERENTLY deny this? (not just "would they" but "could they logically")
2. If yes → CANNOT COMMIT
3. If no → Check the chain (how did we get here?)

## Commitment Chaining

Before committing to X, trace the ASSUME RIGHT chain:
```
X depends on Y being true
Y depends on Z being true
Z depends on...

If ANY link is arbitrary → X cannot be committed
If ALL links are logically necessary → X can be committed
```

## CRUX Rating Guide
- **HIGH** (10-25%): Wrong commitment = solving wrong problem, options narrowed arbitrarily
- **MED** (40-50%): Wrong level assessment = some wasted effort
- **LOW** (30-40%): Minor misclassification

# PART A: LEVEL CLASSIFICATION

## Q1: Is this statement logically necessary?
[D: Level 1 - cannot be coherently denied]

| Entry | CRUX | Why This Rating | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cannot be denied without self-contradiction | LOW | Definition of Level 1 | Can commit | Actually deniable |
| Denying it presupposes it | LOW | Self-undermining denial | Can commit | Denial is coherent |

| Law of non-contradiction | LOW | Foundational logic | Can commit | Logic is questionable |
| Existence claim (I exist to make this claim) | LOW | Self-evident | Can commit | Solipsism is coherent |
| Mathematical necessity (2+2=4) | LOW | Given definitions | Can commit | Definitions disputed |

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 14
ENTRIES: 78

CRUX Distribution:
- HIGH: 30 entries (38%)  ← Higher than usual because wrong commitment is dangerous
- MED: 28 entries (36%)
- LOW: 20 entries (26%)

THE COMMITMENT TEST:
1. Can someone COHERENTLY deny this?
   → Yes: CANNOT COMMIT
   → No: Continue to chain check

2. Is every link in the derivation chain Level 1 (logically necessary)?
   → Any non-Level-1 link: CANNOT COMMIT
   → All Level 1: CAN COMMIT

AGREEABILITY LEVELS:
1. Logically necessary → CAN COMMIT
2. Observationally given → NOTE FRAME, usually OPEN
3. Interpretively shared → CANNOT COMMIT (definitions differ)
4. Preferentially common → CANNOT COMMIT (values differ)
5. Opinion → CANNOT COMMIT (arbitrary)

NON-ARBITRARY NARROWING:
- Don't commit to narrow options
- Let goal-journey narrow naturally:
  - User's stated goal eliminates some
  - Logical impossibility eliminates some
  - User's stated constraints eliminate some
- What remains after non-arbitrary narrowing = valid option set
- If single option remains naturally → that's the answer
- If multiple remain → present options, don't commit

KEY PHRASE:
"Just because it's true for me doesn't mean it's true for everybody"
→ Only commit to what's true for everybody BY LOGIC ITSELF
```
