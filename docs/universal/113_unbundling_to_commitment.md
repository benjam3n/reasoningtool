# Universal: Unbundling to Commitment (113)

**Category**: META - What Can Actually Be Committed To (Revised)
**Source**: [D: from observation that even "I'm hungry" contains hidden guesses]
**Structure**: One question per entry, CRUX-marked with realistic distribution
**Purpose**: Unbundle ALL hidden guesses before considering commitment

## The Problem with Previous Approaches

Even 112's 6 dimensions treated statements too atomically. But:

**"I'm hungry" is NOT certain. It bundles:**
- Guess: My hunger detection is accurate (could be thirst, anxiety, boredom)
- Guess: "Hunger" is the right word for this sensation
- Guess: My language function accurately represents my internal state
- Guess: The other person needs to know this (why say it?)
- Guess: Action is required to address it
- Guess: I know what would satisfy it

**The language function is itself rationalizing.** It constructs narratives about internal states. It doesn't have direct access to "truth."

## What Can ACTUALLY Be Committed To?

After unbundling everything, what remains that contains NO guesses?

```
LEVEL 0: PURE EXISTENCE
├─ "Something is happening"
├─ "Experience is occurring"
├─ "There is processing/activity"
└─ (No claims about WHAT is happening)

LEVEL 1: LOGICAL NECESSITY
├─ "A = A"
├─ "Something cannot both be and not-be simultaneously"
├─ "If P then P"
└─ (Tautologies only)

EVERYTHING ELSE = CONTAINS GUESSES = MUST BE UNBUNDLED
```

## The Unbundling Process

```
1. STATEMENT: What was said?
2. SURFACE GUESSES: What is being claimed?
3. HIDDEN GUESSES: What must be true for the surface claim to be valid?
4. META GUESSES: What assumptions about the claiming process itself?
5. MINIMAL RESIDUE: After removing all guesses, what remains?
6. COMMITMENT?: Is the minimal residue Level 0 or Level 1?
```

## CRUX Rating Guide
- **HIGH** (10-25%): Missing a hidden guess = false confidence
- **MED** (40-50%): Incomplete unbundling
- **LOW** (30-40%): Minor unstated assumption

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 14
ENTRIES: 84

CRUX Distribution:
- HIGH: 32 entries (38%)  ← High because missing guesses = false confidence
- MED: 36 entries (43%)
- LOW: 16 entries (19%)

THE INSIGHT:
Even "I'm hungry" is NOT certain. The language function of the brain
is rationalizing/interpreting, not reporting directly.

WHAT CAN BE COMMITTED TO:
- Level 0: "Something is happening" / "Experience is occurring"
- Level 1: Tautologies (A=A)
- EVERYTHING ELSE: Contains guesses, must be unbundled

THE UNBUNDLING PROCESS:
1. Statement: "I'm hungry"
2. Surface guess: I am experiencing hunger
3. Hidden guesses:
   - Hunger detection is accurate
   - "Hunger" is the right word
   - Language represents internal state accurately
   - This requires action
   - I know what would satisfy it
4. Meta guesses:
   - Language can represent reality
   - I have access to what I claim
   - My rationality is functioning
5. Minimal residue: "Something is being experienced"
6. Commitment: Can commit only to "something is being experienced"
7. Everything else: Work with as guesses, not facts

PRACTICAL IMPLICATION:
We don't stop working because nothing is certain.
We work with guesses AS GUESSES - provisional, revisable,
tracked for dependency and CRUX.
