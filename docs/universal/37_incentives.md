## Q6: What do other parties gain if goal fails?

## Q7: Where are incentives aligned between parties?
[VOI: MED - affects collaboration strategy but same direction]

| No exploits possible | LOW | Move forward vs analyze | Move forward | Exploits exist |

---

## Q10: What commitments should I obtain from others?

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI Questions (ask first - route to different action paths):**
1. Q4: Are incentives aligned with required actions? (helping or hurting?)
2. Q6: What do others gain from failure? (opposition check)
3. Q8: Where are incentives opposed? (conflict prediction)
4. Q9: What could others exploit? (vulnerability assessment)
5. Q1: What rewards exist? (positive motivation)
6. Q2: What costs for inaction? (negative motivation)
7. Q3: Do rewards occur at right times? (timing)

**MED VOI Questions (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
8. Q5: What do others gain from success? (ally identification)
9. Q7: Where are incentives aligned? (collaboration)
10. Q10: What commitments to obtain? (risk reduction)

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Severity**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers lead to completely different action paths. "Do others gain from my failure?" is HIGH VOI because YES → protect against active opposition/sabotage, NO → proceed without defensive measures. These are fundamentally different operational modes.

Incentive structures determine who helps, who hinders, and what motivates action.
