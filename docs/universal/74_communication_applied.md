## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q4: Who is the intended recipient?

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unknown recipient | HIGH | Define recipient first | Recipient definition | Recipient known |
| Multiple recipients | MED | Segment or generalize message | Segment or generalize | Single recipient |
| Specific recipient | LOW | Tailor to them | Tailor message | Wrong recipient |

## Q5: Is the channel appropriate for this message?
[VOI: HIGH - inappropriate channel means message may not land]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, inappropriate | HIGH | Change channel before sending | Change channel | Appropriate |
| Unknown appropriateness | MED | Channel check needed | Channel check | Appropriateness known |
| Yes, appropriate | LOW | Use this channel | Use channel | Inappropriate |

---

## Q6: When should this be communicated?
[VOI: HIGH - urgent means send immediately vs plan timing]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Urgent | HIGH | Send immediately | Send immediately | Not urgent |
| Unknown timing | MED | Timing check needed | Timing check | Timing known |
| Specific timing needed | MED | Hit the timing window | Hit timing | Timing flexible |
| Flexible timing | LOW | Send when convenient | When convenient | Timing matters |

---

## Q7: What does the recipient already know vs need to know?
[VOI: MED - knowledge gap affects level of message]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Recipient knows more | MED | Avoid condescension, adjust up | Adjust up | Knows less |
| Recipient knows less | MED | Provide context, avoid confusion | Provide context | Knows more |
| Gap unknown | MED | Assess knowledge gap | Gap assessment | Gap known |
| Gap well understood | LOW | Match message level | Match level | Gap misunderstood |

---

## Q8: What is the recipient's likely response/reaction?
[VOI: MED - expected reaction affects framing]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Negative expected | MED | Frame thoughtfully, soften | Frame thoughtfully | Positive expected |
| Mixed expected | MED | Prepare for both reactions | Prepare for both | Uniform response |
| Unknown reaction | MED | Predict likely reaction | Reaction prediction | Reaction known |
| Positive expected | LOW | Proceed directly | Proceed | Actually negative |

---

## Q9: Does the channel allow for confirmation and response?
[VOI: MED - bidirectional allows clarification]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No, one-way only | MED | Supplement channel or accept no feedback | Supplement or accept | Bidirectional |
| Unknown if bidirectional | LOW | Test channel capability | Channel testing | Capability known |
| Yes, bidirectional | LOW | Can clarify if needed | Use for dialogue | One-way only |

---

## Q10: How will you know the message was received and understood?
[VOI: MED - confirmation method affects follow-up]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No confirmation possible | MED | Accept uncertainty or change channel | Accept or change channel | Confirmation possible |
| Unknown if confirmed | MED | Check for confirmation method | Confirmation check | Confirmation known |
| Clear confirmation | LOW | Use confirmation method | Use confirmation | No confirmation |

---

## Q11: Should this communication be documented?
[VOI: MED - documentation affects record keeping]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, needs documentation | MED | Create record | Document | No documentation needed |
| Unknown if needs | MED | Check documentation need | Documentation check | Need known |
| No, ephemeral ok | LOW | Skip documentation | Skip | Actually needs documentation |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
1. Q1 (Clear message?) - what to say
2. Q2 (One sentence?) - message clarity
3. Q3 (Unambiguous?) - interpretation risk
4. Q4 (Recipient?) - who to reach
5. Q5 (Channel?) - how to reach
6. Q6 (Timing?) - urgency level

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
7. Q7 (Knowledge gap?) - message level
8. Q8 (Reaction?) - framing
9. Q9 (Bidirectional?) - clarification possible
10. Q10 (Confirmation?) - feedback method
11. Q11 (Documentation?) - record keeping

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ communication importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

Q1 "Is there a clear message?" is HIGH VOI because:
- CLEAR → proceed to delivery
- VAGUE → must clarify first (different work)

Q11 "Should this be documented?" is MED VOI because:
- YES → create record after sending
- NO → just send (same communication, different follow-up)

Message clarity determines whether you can communicate at all. Documentation is a follow-up activity after communication.
