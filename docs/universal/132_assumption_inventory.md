## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q3: How many assumptions are we making?

[VOI: HIGH - high assumption count = high fragility]

## Q4: Are assumptions independent or correlated?

[VOI: HIGH - correlated assumptions = cascade failures]

| Unknown correlation | MED | May cascade | Correlation analysis | Either cascade or isolated |
| Assumptions independent | LOW | Isolated failures | Proceed | Actually correlated |

## Q5: Which assumptions are load-bearing?

[VOI: HIGH - load-bearing assumptions need most scrutiny]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Load-bearing misidentified | HIGH | Scrutinizing wrong ones | Identify load-bearing | Miss critical failure point |
| Unknown which load-bearing | MED | May miss critical | Load analysis | Either miss or identify |
| Load-bearing identified | LOW | Know what matters | Scrutinize them | Actually misidentified |

---

## Q6: Can we test assumptions before relying on them?

[VOI: MED - affects confidence but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can test but haven't | MED | Avoidable risk | Test assumptions | Risk untested failure |
| Unknown if testable | MED | May be avoidable | Testability check | Either test or accept |
| Can't test | LOW | Must accept risk | Proceed with caution | Think can't when can |
| Already tested | LOW | Verified | Proceed confidently | Actually untested |

---

## Q7: What would change if key assumptions were wrong?

[VOI: MED - affects contingency but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Everything changes | MED | High stakes | Stress test | Catastrophic if wrong |
| Some things change | LOW | Moderate stakes | Plan contingency | Underestimate impact |
| Nothing changes | LOW | Robust to assumption | Proceed | Actually sensitive |
| Unknown impact | MED | May be high stakes | Impact analysis | Either catastrophic or fine |

---

## Q8: Are we assuming the problem as stated is the real problem?

[VOI: MED - meta-assumption about problem definition]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Problem misframed | MED | Solving wrong problem | Reframe problem | Solve phantom |
| Unknown if correct framing | MED | May be solving wrong | Framing check | Either phantom or real |
| Problem correctly framed | LOW | Solving right problem | Proceed | Actually misframed |

---

## Q9: Are we assuming current conditions persist?

[VOI: LOW - affects robustness but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Conditions will change | LOW | Solution may become invalid | Build in adaptability | Solution obsolete |
| Unknown if persist | LOW | May become invalid | Condition analysis | Either obsolete or valid |
| Conditions stable | LOW | Solution persists | Proceed | Actually changing |

---

## Q10: Are we assuming our own competence correctly?

[VOI: LOW - affects execution but similar planning]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overestimating competence | LOW | May fail execution | Honest assessment | Fail from incompetence |
| Unknown competence match | LOW | May mismatch | Competence check | Either fail or succeed |
| Competence appropriate | LOW | Can execute | Proceed | Actually overestimating |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Hidden assumptions? - blind spots
2. Q2: Critical assumptions true? - foundation validity
3. Q3: Assumption count? - fragility
4. Q4: Assumptions correlated? - cascade risk
5. Q5: Which are load-bearing? - scrutiny targeting

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Can test? - verification opportunity
7. Q7: Impact if wrong? - stakes
8. Q8: Problem framed right? - meta-assumption

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Conditions persist? - robustness
10. Q10: Competence correct? - execution

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth about assumptions. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are we assuming our own competence correctly?" is useful but has LOW VOI - you plan similarly either way.

"Are critical assumptions actually true?" has HIGH VOI - false critical assumption means entire reasoning collapses.

## The Assumption Stack

Every conclusion rests on a stack of assumptions:
- Explicit assumptions (stated)
- Implicit assumptions (unstated but known)
- Hidden assumptions (unknown until surfaced)
- Meta-assumptions (assumptions about the problem itself)

**Fragility = assumptions × (1 - confidence) × correlation**

A reasoning chain with 10 assumptions at 90% confidence each has only 35% chance of being fully correct.

If assumptions are correlated, one failure triggers multiple.

**The move**: Before trusting any reasoning, ask "What am I assuming?" until you can't find more. Then verify the load-bearing ones.
