## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Impact) - what's at stake
2. **Q2** (Probability) - how likely
3. **Q3** (Mitigable?) - can we reduce
4. **Q4** (Type) - what kind of risk
5. **Q7** (Contingency) - are we prepared
6. **Q6** (Warning signs) - can we see it coming
7. **Q8** (Related) - cascade effects
8. **Q5** (Mitigation cost) - investment needed
9. **Q10-Q11** (Overall level, timing)
10. **Q9, Q12** (Appetite, transfer) - details

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is this risk not mitigable?" routes to accept or avoid entirely vs mitigation planning. "Is this a cascade risk?" routes to addressing root cause vs isolated risk management.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
