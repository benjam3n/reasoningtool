## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask HIGH VOI questions first - they route to completely different action paths:**

1. **Q1** (Is constraint real?) - don't work around false constraints
2. **Q2** (How hard?) - absolute vs negotiable
3. **Q3** (Does it block goal?) - fundamental conflict check
4. **Q4** (Consequences of violation) - stakes
5. **Q5** (Workarounds exist?) - alternatives
6. **Q6** (Type) - understand nature
7. **Q7** (Origin) - controllable?
8. **Q8** (Count/conflicts) - complexity
9. **Q9-Q10** (Horizon, changeability) - dynamics

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ Importance or Difficulty**

VOI = Action Divergence

A question has HIGH VOI when different answers send you down completely different paths. "Is this constraint assumed or verified?" routes to challenging the constraint vs accepting it. "Does this constraint directly block the goal?" routes to finding alternative goals vs working within limits.

LOW VOI questions may still matter, but different answers lead to the same general actions with minor adjustments.
