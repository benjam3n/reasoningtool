## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

| Yes, sunk costs influencing | HIGH | Evaluate only future costs/benefits vs continue | Evaluate only future costs/benefits | Escalation of commitment, deeper hole |
| Unknown if influenced | MED | Sunk cost audit vs proceed | Sunk cost audit | Continue failing path from false rationality |
| No, forward-looking only | LOW | Proceed with decision | Proceed | Past investment invisibly pulling decision |

---

## Q7: Is the way information is presented (framing) affecting judgment?
[VOI: HIGH - framing affecting means decision would change if reframed vs frame-independent is robust]

| No, frame-independent | LOW | Proceed with robust decision | Proceed | Frame dependence invisible until too late |

---

## Q8: Are you assuming typical case when this might be atypical?
[VOI: HIGH - assuming typical means wrong category vs accounting for atypicality enables correct response]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, assuming typical | HIGH | Check actual base rates vs proceed on pattern | Check actual base rates | Treat rare as common, misallocate response |
| Unknown typicality | MED | Base rate check vs proceed | Base rate check | Surprised when "obvious" pattern fails |
| No, accounting for atypicality | LOW | Proceed with correct category | Proceed | Pattern match overrides statistics |

---

## Q9: Is group consensus masking individual doubt?
[VOI: HIGH - groupthink means dissent suppressed vs genuine consensus enables proceeding]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, groupthink occurring | HIGH | Actively solicit disagreement vs proceed | Actively solicit disagreement | Unanimous wrong decision, no warning |
| Unknown if groupthink | MED | Anonymous dissent check vs proceed | Anonymous dissent check | Confident agreement hides crucial objections |
| No, genuine consensus | LOW | Proceed with agreement | Proceed | Silent doubts emerge as failure |

---

## Q10: Are you planning for success without considering obstacles?
[VOI: HIGH - optimistic planning means will miss deadline/budget vs realistic enables achievable plan]

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 11
ENTRIES: 33

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 11 entries (33%)
- MED: 11 entries (33%)
- LOW: 11 entries (33%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because bias creates systematic error across decisions

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
All "Yes, biased" answers are HIGH VOI because they require immediate intervention:
- Q5-Q6: Overconfident? Sunk costs? - personal bias
- Q2-Q3: Confirming? Availability? - evidence gathering
- Q9-Q10: Groupthink? Planning fallacy? - collective bias
- Q1, Q4, Q7-Q8, Q11: Anchoring, emotion, framing, typicality, reversibility

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
All "Unknown if biased" answers - need checking before proceeding

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ bias severity or frequency**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (seek contrary evidence vs proceed, defer decision vs act, widen confidence intervals vs trust estimates). The key is that for cognitive biases, "Yes, biased" almost always demands different action than "No, not biased."
