## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are we using the same words to mean the same things?

[VOI: HIGH - different meanings = talking past each other entirely]

## Q6: Are we reifying abstractions (treating concepts as things)?

| Appropriate abstraction | LOW | Useful shorthand | Use abstraction | Treat concept as actor |

## Q7: Is the metaphor helping or misleading?

[VOI: MED - affects lens but similar analysis work]

| Metaphor misleads | HIGH | Hiding important aspects | Change metaphor | Miss what metaphor hides |
| Unknown if helps | MED | May mislead | Metaphor testing | Unknowingly misled |
| Metaphor helps | LOW | Good lens | Use metaphor | Metaphor misleads |

## Q8: Are we confusing description with prescription?

| Plain language | LOW | Seeing clearly | Trust | Euphemisms hiding |

---

## Q10: Is negative framing creating false limitations?

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Same meanings? - talking past each other
2. Q2: Word or world problem? - dissolves vs needs action
3. Q3: Label accurate? - wrong name = wrong frame
4. Q4: Vague words = vague thinking? - clarity
5. Q5: Technical language necessary? - obscuring
6. Q6: Reifying abstractions? - concepts don't act

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
7. Q7: Metaphor helping? - lens
8. Q8: Confusing is/ought? - reasoning
9. Q9: Euphemisms? - understanding

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
10. Q10: Negative framing? - limitations
11. Q11: Vocabulary trap? - thought space

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ linguistic sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are we trapped by vocabulary?" sounds deep but has LOW VOI - you do similar work regardless.

"Are we using the same words to mean the same things?" has HIGH VOI - talking past each other means completely wasted effort.
