# Universal: Agency and Control (96)

**Category**: META - What Can Be Influenced
**Source**: Distinguishing controllable from uncontrollable
**Structure**: Questions ordered by Value of Information (action divergence)

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Q1: Are we targeting something uncontrollable?

[VOI: HIGH - effort on uncontrollable is completely wasted]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

| Unknown if controllable | MED | May be wasting | Target check | Either waste or miss |
| Appropriately targeted | LOW | Effort well-placed | Continue | Actually targeting uncontrollable |

---

## Q2: Who has the power to make this happen?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong target = wasted persuasion]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Power holder misidentified | HIGH | Wrong target | Find actual power | Persuade powerless, nothing happens |
| Unknown who has power | MED | May target wrong | Power mapping | Wrong target, frustration |
| Power holder identified | LOW | Right target | Engage them | Wrong target, wasted effort |

---

## Q3: Who/what is actually deciding?

[VOI: HIGH - nominal decider may not be actual decider]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Decider misidentified | HIGH | Wrong target | Find actual decider | Persuade figurehead, nothing changes |
| Unknown who decides | MED | May target wrong | Decision mapping | Wonder why agreement doesn't stick |
| Decider known | LOW | Can engage | Engage actual decider | Wrong person, wasted effort |

---

## Q4: Is the constraint real or perceived?

[VOI: HIGH - perceived constraints are self-imposed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Perceived constraint | HIGH | Self-imposed | Challenge | Accept imaginary limitation |
| Unknown if real | MED | May be limiting self | Constraint testing | Either accept false or fight real |
| Real constraint | LOW | Must work around | Accept and work within | Think real when imagined |

---

## Q5: What's our actual agency in this situation?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong calibration = wrong effort level]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Agency misestimated | HIGH | Wrong effort allocation | Recalibrate | Either overreach or underreach |
| Low agency | MED | Accept limits | Work within | Under-act on possible |
| No agency | MED | Accept fully | Accept | Miss actual agency |
| High agency | LOW | Can act | Act boldly | Overcommit to impossible |

---

## Q6: Can we change the rules or only play within them?

[VOI: MED - affects strategy but similar engagement work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can change rules | MED | Meta-game available | Consider rule change | Play bad game when could change |
| Unknown if changeable | MED | May miss option | Rule changeability check | Either accept bad or tilt windmills |
| Must play within rules | LOW | Game is fixed | Optimize within | Waste effort on unchangeable |

---

## Q7: Is resistance coming from inertia or opposition?

[VOI: MED - affects intervention type but similar engagement]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inertia | MED | Needs energy input | Apply force | Negotiate with inertia (pointless) |
| Active opposition | MED | Needs engagement | Engage opposition | Push against opponent, escalate |
| Both | MED | Both approaches | Address both | Miss one source |
| Unknown source | MED | Wrong intervention | Source analysis | Wrong intervention type |

---

## Q8: Is this within our control or outside it?

[VOI: MED - affects approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Outside control | MED | Accept or influence | Adapt | Rage against immovable |
| Unknown if controllable | MED | May waste effort | Control check | Either waste or miss opportunity |
| Within control | LOW | Can act directly | Act | Waste effort on uncontrollable |

---

## Q9: Can we influence even if we can't control?

[VOI: MED - affects approach but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can influence | MED | Can shift probability | Influence | Miss opportunity to shift odds |
| Unknown if influenceable | MED | May miss | Influence check | Either waste or miss |
| Cannot influence | LOW | Accept | Accept | Waste effort on uninfluenceable |

---

## Q10: Can we exit or must we engage?

[VOI: LOW - affects option set but similar decision process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Exit not possible | LOW | Must engage | Engage | Waste effort seeking exit |
| Exit costly | LOW | Tradeoff | Weigh cost | Under/overestimate exit cost |
| Unknown if can exit | LOW | May miss option | Exit analysis | Trapped unnecessarily or abandon prematurely |
| Exit possible | LOW | Option available | Consider exit | Think trapped when can leave |

---

## Q11: Are we the agent or the environment?

[VOI: LOW - affects perspective but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| We are environment | LOW | Being acted upon | Respond | Think choosing when conditioned |
| Mixed | LOW | Some of both | Know which | Over/under estimate agency |
| Unknown role | LOW | May be confused | Role analysis | Illusion of agency or learned helplessness |
| We are agent | LOW | Can act | Act | Think acting when reacting |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Targeting uncontrollable? - effort allocation
2. Q2: Who has power? - right target
3. Q3: Who actually decides? - right target
4. Q4: Real or perceived constraint? - self-limitation
5. Q5: Actual agency? - effort calibration

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
6. Q6: Change rules? - meta-game
7. Q7: Inertia or opposition? - intervention type
8. Q8: Within control? - approach
9. Q9: Can influence? - probability shifting

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
10. Q10: Can exit? - option set
11. Q11: Agent or environment? - perspective

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ philosophical depth. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are we the agent or the environment?" sounds profound but has LOW VOI - you do similar work either way.

"Who actually has the power to decide?" has HIGH VOI - persuading the wrong person is completely wasted effort.
