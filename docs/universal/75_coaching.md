## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: What skill/knowledge/behavior level is the target?
[VOI: HIGH - vague/unrealistic/unknown target means no clear goal]

---

## Q2: Is the target agreed upon by both parties?

## Q3: Is the gap in knowledge, skill, or will?
[VOI: HIGH - wrong gap type means wrong intervention]

## Q4: What specific intervention addresses the gap?
[VOI: HIGH - unclear/mismatched intervention means wasted effort]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Intervention unclear | HIGH | Design intervention for gap | Match to gap type | Intervention clear |
| One-size-fits-all | HIGH | Customize to specific gap | Customize | Matched intervention |
| Unknown intervention | HIGH | Intervention design needed | Intervention design | Intervention known |
| Intervention matched to gap | LOW | Apply intervention | Apply | Mismatched intervention |

---

## Q5: What is the current skill/knowledge/behavior level?
[VOI: HIGH - overestimated/unknown baseline means wrong starting point]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overestimated | HIGH | Reassess baseline lower | Assess lower | Actually higher |
| Unknown current level | HIGH | Assessment first | Assessment first | Level known |
| Underestimated | MED | Adjust baseline higher | Assess higher | Actually lower |
| Accurately assessed | LOW | Build from this baseline | Build from here | Inaccurate assessment |

---

## Q6: How is current level measured or observed?
[VOI: HIGH - no measurement means unknown baseline]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No measurement | HIGH | Create measurement first | Create measurement | Measurement exists |
| Self-report only | MED | Add verification | Verify | Objective exists |
| Observation | MED | Use carefully, add objective | Use with care | Measurement exists |
| Objective measurement | LOW | Reliable baseline | Use metric | Subjective only |

---

## Q7: How will progress be measured?
[VOI: HIGH - no measurement means no feedback loop]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No measurement | HIGH | Create progress measurement | Create measurement | Measurement exists |
| Unknown measurement | MED | Design measurement | Measurement design | Measurement known |
| Observation only | MED | Add objective measures | Add objective | Metrics exist |
| Clear metrics | LOW | Use metrics to track | Use metrics | No metrics |

---

## Q8: What indicates the approach isn't working?
[VOI: HIGH - no failure signals means won't know to pivot]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No failure signals | HIGH | Define failure signals | Define signals | Signals defined |
| Unknown if signals exist | MED | Signal definition needed | Signal definition | Signals known |
| Failure signals defined | LOW | Watch for signals | Watch for signals | No signals defined |

---

## Q9: Is feedback specific, timely, and actionable?
[VOI: HIGH - not actionable means can't act on feedback]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Feedback not actionable | HIGH | Make actionable | Make actionable | Actionable |
| No feedback | HIGH | Provide feedback | Provide feedback | Feedback exists |
| Feedback not specific | MED | Be more specific | Be specific | Specific |
| Feedback not timely | MED | Speed up feedback loop | Speed up | Timely |
| Yes, quality feedback | LOW | Continue feedback approach | Continue | Poor feedback |

---

## Q10: What milestones indicate progress?
[VOI: MED - milestones help track but aren't required]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Milestones vague | MED | Clarify milestones | Clarify | Milestones clear |
| No milestones | MED | Define milestones | Define milestones | Milestones exist |
| Unknown milestones | MED | Milestone definition | Milestone definition | Milestones known |
| Milestones defined | LOW | Use milestones to track | Use milestones | No milestones |

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 10
ENTRIES: 43

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 13 entries (30%)
- MED: 18 entries (42%)
- LOW: 12 entries (28%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because coaching mismatch wastes time and damages relationships

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
1. Q1 (Target?) - where going
2. Q2 (Agreement?) - buy-in exists
3. Q3 (Gap type?) - what intervention needed
4. Q4 (Intervention?) - right approach
5. Q5 (Current level?) - baseline correct
6. Q6 (Level measurement?) - baseline reliable
7. Q7 (Progress measurement?) - feedback loop
8. Q8 (Failure signals?) - know when to pivot
9. Q9 (Feedback quality?) - can act on feedback

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
10. Q10 (Milestones?) - progress markers

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ coaching importance**

**VOI = action divergence**

Q3 "Is the gap in knowledge, skill, or will?" is HIGH VOI because:
- KNOWLEDGE → teach/inform
- SKILL → train/practice
- WILL → address motivation (completely different interventions)

Q10 "What milestones?" is MED VOI because:
- DEFINED → use them to celebrate progress
- UNDEFINED → track without formal milestones (same coaching, different tracking)

Gap type determines the entire intervention approach. Milestones are just progress markers.
