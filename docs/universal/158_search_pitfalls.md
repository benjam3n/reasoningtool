## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Three patterns corrupt search results:**

1. **Fish in Dreams**: Finding what was expected to be found (confirmation)
2. **Red Herring**: Explanations that don't match what they're explaining (fabrication)
3. **Smokescreen**: Confusion appearing when approaching something important (protection)

Each produces false results that feel valid.

## Q1: Is the finding what was expected?

[VOI: HIGH - expected finding = possible confirmation bias]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, exactly what expected | HIGH | May be confirmation | Search for contrary | Keep finding same thing |
| No, unexpected | LOW | Probably genuine | Continue | Miss subtle bias |

---

## Q2: Does the explanation match what it's explaining?

[VOI: HIGH - mismatch = fabricated explanation]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Matches | MED | Probably genuine | Work with explanation | Miss mismatch |
| Does not match | HIGH | Fabricated explanation | Find real source | Chase false explanation |

---

## Q3: Does confusion appear when approaching a topic?

[VOI: HIGH - sudden confusion = close to something important]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes | HIGH | Close to something protected | Persist through confusion | Give up near breakthrough |
| No | LOW | Clear path | Continue | Miss subtle protection |

---

## Q4: Whose pattern is being found?

[VOI: HIGH - may be finding own patterns projected]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Own pattern projected | HIGH | Not genuine finding | Stop projecting | Find own patterns everywhere |
| Genuine pattern | LOW | Valid finding | Work with it | Miss projection |

---

## Q5: Was the explanation constructed after the fact?

[VOI: MED - post-hoc explanation = rationalization]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, constructed after | MED | Rationalization | Find underlying source | Work with false explanation |
| No, pre-existing | LOW | May be genuine | Work with it | Miss fabrication |

---

## Q6: What topic triggers the confusion?

[VOI: MED - trigger = important area]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Specific topic identified | MED | That topic is important | Approach carefully | Avoid important area |
| No specific trigger | LOW | No protective pattern | Continue normally | Miss subtle trigger |

---

## Q7: What finding is desired?

[VOI: MED - strong desire = high bias risk]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Strong desire for specific finding | MED | High bias risk | Search for opposite | Find what's wanted |
| No strong desire | LOW | Lower bias risk | Normal search | Miss subtle desire |

---

## Q8: Does "I don't know" indicate closeness or distance?

[VOI: MED - "don't know" can mean either]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Closeness (protection) | MED | Persist gently | Push through | Give up at threshold |
| Distance (genuine gap) | MED | Try different approach | Different angle | Push on empty |

---

## Q9: Is the feeling attached to its actual source?

[VOI: LOW - free-floating feelings attach to available explanations]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, correctly attached | LOW | Work with source | Continue | Miss misattachment |
| No, misattached | LOW | Find actual source | Trace back | Accept false attachment |

---

## Q10: Is the same thing being found repeatedly?

[VOI: LOW - repetition = possible bias]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Yes, always same thing | LOW | Suspicious pattern | Search for variety | Keep finding same |
| No, variety | LOW | Probably genuine | Continue | Miss subtle repetition |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Is the finding what was expected?
2. Q2: Does explanation match what it's explaining?
3. Q3: Does confusion appear when approaching?
4. Q4: Whose pattern is being found?

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Was explanation constructed after?
6. Q6: What topic triggers confusion?
7. Q7: What finding is desired?
8. Q8: Does "don't know" mean close or far?

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
9. Q9: Is feeling attached to actual source?
10. Q10: Is same thing found repeatedly?

## The Three Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What Happens | Detection | Response |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Fish in Dreams** | Find what's expected | Same thing found repeatedly | Search for opposite |
| **Red Herring** | Chase false explanation | Explanation doesn't match | Find actual source |
| **Smokescreen** | Confusion near important | Sudden blanking | Persist gently |

---

## Detection Summary

**Corrupted search produces**:
- Confirming evidence (Fish)
- Logical explanations for wrong things (Herring)
- Dead ends near breakthroughs (Smokescreen)

**Clean search produces**:
- Surprising findings
- Explanations that match feelings
- Clarity that increases as you approach
