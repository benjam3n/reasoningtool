## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**Thought patterns have direction. Matching direction creates resonance; mismatching creates confusion.**

**Forward/External direction** (stereotypically male):
- Action → Physical result → Next action
- Event causes event causes event
- Meaning = impact on external world
- "The car means I can go places and impress people"

**Inward/Abstract direction** (stereotypically female):
- Stimulus → Emotion → Deeper emotion → Identity/values
- Each step more abstract than last
- Meaning = how it relates to who I am
- "The car means celebrating my desires → freedom → self-discovery → connecting with who I truly am"

**Note**: These are processing patterns, not gender essences. Anyone can use either direction.

## Q1: What processing direction does this context favor?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong direction = message doesn't resonate]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Context favors inward, using forward | HIGH | No resonance | Switch to inward/abstract | Facts land, meaning missed |
| Context favors forward, using inward | HIGH | Seems irrelevant | Switch to forward/external | Emotional when should be practical |
| Unknown context direction | MED | May be mismatching | Direction analysis | Either direction wrong |
| Direction matched to context | LOW | Good resonance | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q2: What's the receiver's natural direction?

[VOI: HIGH - matching their pattern creates connection]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| They process inward, we're going forward | HIGH | Speaking different languages | Mirror their direction | Technically right, emotionally distant |
| They process forward, we're going inward | HIGH | Seems over-complicated | Mirror their direction | Emotional when want practical |
| Unknown their direction | MED | May be mismatched | Direction diagnosis | Either match or mismatch |
| Direction matched to them | LOW | Pattern resonance | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q3: Are we following the chain or fighting it?

[VOI: HIGH - going with chain flow vs against it]

| Unknown if aligned | MED | May be fighting | Chain analysis | Either flowing or fighting |
| Following their chain | LOW | Flow enabled | Continue | Actually fighting |

---

## Q4: Is the meaning being processed at right level?

[VOI: HIGH - meaning level must match processing direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Meaning at wrong level | HIGH | Doesn't land | Adjust level | Message misses its mark |
| Unknown if right level | MED | May be missing | Level check | Either right or wrong level |
| Meaning at right level | LOW | Lands correctly | Continue | Actually wrong level |

---

## Q5: Can we lead them from their direction to another?

[VOI: MED - enables state change if possible]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can lead direction but haven't | MED | Missed opportunity | Match first, then lead | Stay in their direction only |
| Unknown if can lead | MED | May be able to shift | Lead test | Either lead or stay |
| Cannot lead their direction | LOW | Must stay in theirs | Adapt fully | Fight unchangeable |

---

## Q6: What's the appropriate chain depth?

[VOI: MED - depth affects intensity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too shallow | MED | Misses depth | Go deeper in chain | Surface when should dive |
| Too deep | MED | Loses them | Stay shallower | Overthinking simple |
| Unknown appropriate depth | MED | May be wrong | Depth calibration | Either shallow or deep |
| Depth calibrated | LOW | Matched | Continue | Actually miscalibrated |

---

## Q7: Are we using bridges between levels?

[VOI: MED - bridges enable flow]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Missing bridges | MED | Jumpy/disconnected | Add imagery bridges | Leaps feel arbitrary |
| Unknown bridge quality | MED | May have gaps | Bridge audit | Either smooth or jumpy |
| Bridges in place | LOW | Smooth flow | Continue | Actually missing |

---

## Q8: Is identity/values being reached?

[VOI: LOW - affects depth but similar direction]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not reaching identity level | LOW | Shallower impact | Go deeper if appropriate | Miss deepest resonance |
| Unknown if reaching identity | LOW | May be stopping early | Depth check | Either reaching or not |
| Reaching identity level | LOW | Maximum depth | Maintain | Actually not reaching |

---

## Q9: Are emotions being stacked?

[VOI: LOW - affects complexity but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Not stacking (single emotion) | LOW | Simpler experience | Stack if appropriate | Miss compound effect |
| Unknown stacking | LOW | May be missing | Stack check | Either stacking or not |
| Emotions stacking | LOW | Compound effect | Continue | Actually not stacking |

---

## Q10: Is the mythic pattern being honored?

[VOI: LOW - affects resonance but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Male pattern (target→confront→struggle→master) | LOW | Action hero arc | Match if appropriate | Wrong mythic frame |
| Female pattern (realize→accept→open→connect→incorporate) | LOW | Discovery arc | Match if appropriate | Wrong mythic frame |
| Unknown which pattern | LOW | May be mismatched | Pattern detection | Either pattern |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Context direction? - approach
2. Q2: Receiver's direction? - matching
3. Q3: Following or fighting chain? - flow
4. Q4: Meaning at right level? - landing

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Can lead direction? - shifting
6. Q6: Chain depth? - intensity
7. Q7: Bridges between levels? - smoothness

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: Reaching identity? - depth
9. Q9: Emotions stacking? - complexity
10. Q10: Mythic pattern? - archetype

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the mythic pattern being honored?" is interesting but has LOW VOI - similar approach either way.

"What processing direction does this context favor?" has HIGH VOI - wrong direction means your message doesn't resonate at all.

## The Two Directions

**Forward/External Pattern**:
```
action → physical result → next action → physical result
```
- Meaning = what happens next in external world
- Satisfaction = mastering challenges, accumulating results
- Male Mythic Pattern: targeting → confronting → struggling → mastering

**Inward/Abstract Pattern**:
```
stimulus → emotion → deeper emotion → identity connection
```
- Meaning = how it relates to who I am
- Satisfaction = discovering more about self, deeper emotional experience
- Female Mythic Pattern: realizing → accepting → opening → connecting → incorporating

---

## Example: Same Event, Two Directions

**Event**: Buying a sports car

**Forward/External processing**:
"This means I can go more places faster, and more women will be impressed, which means more dates."
→ Car → external result → next external result

**Inward/Abstract processing**:
"This means celebrating my desires → feeling freedom → discovering more about myself → connecting with who I truly am"
→ Car → emotion → deeper emotion → identity

**Both are valid**. The key is matching your communication to the receiver's processing direction.

## The Cascade Effect

For inward/abstract processors, emotions cascade:
- X leads to Y leads to Z
- Each step more abstract
- Each step more influential

You can describe this cascade and they will follow it:
"When you feel comfort, it leads to serenity, which leads to feeling open to new experiences, which leads to knowing you're growing and in touch with your path..."

**The trap:** Using forward/external language with inward/abstract processors (or vice versa). You're speaking different languages.

**The move:** Match their processing direction first. Then you can lead them wherever you want to go.
