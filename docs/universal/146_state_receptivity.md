## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

## Core Insight

**State determines receptivity. Content that works in receptive state bounces off guarded state.**

**Head State** (analytical/guarded):
- Evaluating, scrutinizing, skeptical
- Filtering for threats and inconsistencies
- Logic channels work, emotional channels don't
- Influence requires evidence and argumentation

**Gut State/Alpha** (receptive/open):
- Absorbing, experiencing, trusting
- Source has been classified as "good information"
- Emotional channels work powerfully
- Influence flows easily through experience

**Signs of Alpha**: Relaxed features, dreamy or intent expression, stillness, awaiting input, defocused gaze

**How Alpha is achieved**: Strong rapport through alignment, trust established through Verbal Matching, emotional engagement

## Q1: What state is the receiver in?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong approach for state = influence bounces]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Guarded (Head) state | HIGH | Must use logic or shift state | Either argue or build rapport first | Emotional approach rejected |
| Unknown state | MED | May be using wrong approach | State diagnosis | Either Head or Gut |
| Receptive (Gut/Alpha) state | HIGH | Emotional approach works | Use experiential influence | Logical when should be experiential |

---

## Q2: Have we established rapport?

[VOI: HIGH - rapport is precondition for receptivity]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| No rapport established | HIGH | Can't access receptive state | Build rapport first | Content before connection |
| Unknown rapport level | MED | May be insufficient | Rapport check | Either connected or not |
| Strong rapport established | LOW | Can access receptivity | Proceed to content | Actually insufficient |

---

## Q3: Have we been classified as "good source"?

[VOI: HIGH - source classification determines trust]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Classified as unreliable/threatening | HIGH | Everything filtered skeptically | Rebuild classification | Information rejected at source |
| Unknown classification | MED | May be distrusted | Classification check | Either trusted or not |
| Classified as good source | LOW | Information absorbed | Continue | Actually distrusted |

---

## Q4: Is there a state mismatch to bridge?

[VOI: HIGH - mismatched states = no connection]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| We're excited, they're calm | MED | Energy mismatch | Match their calm first | Jarring, creates distance |
| We're calm, they're agitated | MED | Energy mismatch | Match their energy first | Dismissive, creates distance |
| Unknown state relationship | MED | May be mismatched | State comparison | Either matched or not |
| States matched | LOW | Bridge exists | Continue | Actually mismatched |

---

## Q5: Can we induce Alpha state?

[VOI: MED - Alpha enables deeper influence]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can induce Alpha but haven't | MED | Missing receptivity window | Build deeper rapport | Settle for surface influence |
| Unknown if can induce | MED | May be possible | Induction attempt | Either possible or not |
| Cannot induce Alpha | LOW | Work with current state | Adapt approach | Miss opportunity |
| Already in Alpha | LOW | Maximum receptivity | Maintain and utilize | Actually not in Alpha |

---

## Q6: How fragile is the current state?

[VOI: MED - fragile states need careful handling]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| State is fragile | MED | Can easily lose it | Handle carefully | Disrupt good state |
| Unknown fragility | MED | May be fragile | Fragility check | Either robust or fragile |
| State is robust | LOW | Can work freely | Proceed | Actually fragile |

---

## Q7: Is continuous input needed?

[VOI: MED - receptive states require maintenance]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need continuous input | MED | Must keep talking/acting | Maintain flow | Stop and lose state |
| Unknown input requirement | MED | May need maintenance | Requirement check | Either maintain or not |
| Input not needed | LOW | State self-sustaining | Pause acceptable | Actually needs input |

---

## Q8: What triggers state shifts?

[VOI: LOW - affects maintenance but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Triggers unknown | LOW | May accidentally trigger | Trigger mapping | Miss warning signs |
| Triggers known | LOW | Can avoid/utilize | Use strategically | Triggers missed anyway |

---

## Q9: Can state depth increase?

[VOI: LOW - affects intensity but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Can go deeper | LOW | More receptivity available | Deepen if useful | Miss depth opportunity |
| Unknown depth potential | LOW | May be able to deepen | Depth test | Either deepen or not |
| At maximum depth | LOW | Full receptivity | Utilize current depth | Actually can go deeper |

---

## Q10: Is the state authentic or performed?

[VOI: LOW - affects durability but similar approach]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Performed receptivity | LOW | May snap back | Test authenticity | Think connected, not |
| Unknown authenticity | LOW | May be fake | Authenticity check | Either genuine or not |
| Genuine receptivity | LOW | Durable state | Proceed confidently | Actually performed |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: What state? - approach selection
2. Q2: Rapport established? - precondition
3. Q3: Classified as good source? - trust
4. Q4: State mismatch? - connection

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
5. Q5: Can induce Alpha? - deepening
6. Q6: State fragility? - handling
7. Q7: Continuous input needed? - maintenance

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
8. Q8: State shift triggers? - mapping
9. Q9: Can go deeper? - intensity
10. Q10: Authentic or performed? - durability

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ psychological depth about states. VOI = action divergence.**

"Is the state authentic or performed?" is interesting but has LOW VOI - you proceed similarly either way.

"What state is the receiver in?" has HIGH VOI - wrong approach for the state means your influence bounces off entirely.

---

## The Two States

**Head State** (analytical):
- Critical, evaluating, skeptical
- Filtering for inconsistencies and threats
- Logical arguments work
- Emotional appeals blocked
- Evidence and reasoning required

**Gut State / Alpha** (receptive):
- Open, absorbing, trusting
- Instinctive classification: "good source"
- Emotional channels wide open
- Experiences and images absorbed directly
- Words create vivid internal experience

---

## How to Shift States

**Head → Gut/Alpha**:
1. **Verbal Matching**: Say things they already believe or can verify with senses
2. **External Alignment**: Match their posture, rhythm, energy
3. **Build truth chains**: Each verified truth increases trust
4. **Increase rapport progressively**: Don't rush intimacy
5. **Signs of Alpha**: Relaxed features, defocused gaze, stillness, awaiting input

**Maintaining Alpha**:
- Keep talking and acting (no input = state drops)
- Maintain rhythm and flow
- Don't break rapport with jarring moves
- Alpha feels like a good massage - keep it feeling good

**Alpha amplifies impact**:
- In Alpha, a vague word like "satisfaction" can evoke vivid images, memories, sensations
- Normal communication impact multiplied
- Head is passive, Gut is dominant and absorbing

---

## The Sequence

1. **Assess state**: Head or Gut?
2. **If Head**: Either work with logic OR build rapport to shift state
3. **If Gut**: Use experiential influence, maintain the state
4. **Check rapport**: Strong enough for the influence you want?
5. **Check classification**: Are you seen as good source?
6. **Proceed**: With approach matched to state

**The trap:** Using emotional/experiential influence on someone in Head state. It bounces off.

**The move:** Before attempting influence, assess their state. If guarded, build rapport first. If receptive, utilize the opening.
