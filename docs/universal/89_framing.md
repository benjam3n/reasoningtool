# Universal: Framing and Reframing (89)

**Category**: META - How We're Looking at This
**Source**: New meta-category - the frame determines what's visible and possible
**Structure**: One question per entry, VOI-marked with realistic distribution

---

## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

---

## Q1: What frame are we using to see this?
[VOI: HIGH - implicit/unknown frame means hidden blinders vs explicit enables deliberate use]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Frame implicit (unexamined) | HIGH | Make frame explicit vs miss what it hides | Make frame explicit | Invisible constraints on thinking |
| Unknown what frame | HIGH | Frame identification vs operate blind | Frame identification | Can't evaluate appropriateness |
| Multiple frames available | MED | Use multiple vs stuck in one | Use multiple | Stuck in one when others better |
| Frame explicit and chosen | LOW | Use deliberately | Use deliberately | Miss what frame hides |

---

## Q2: Is this frame serving or limiting us?
[VOI: HIGH - frame limiting means preventing solutions vs frame serving enables progress]

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Frame limiting | HIGH | Reframe vs stay stuck | Reframe | Stuck in bad frame, miss solutions |
| Unknown if serving | MED | Frame evaluation vs proceed | Frame evaluation | Unknowingly constrained |
| Frame both | MED | Consider switch vs stay | Consider switch | Either overvalue or undervalue current |

---

## Q3: What would we see from a different frame?

---

## Q5: Is this a problem frame or opportunity frame?
[VOI: HIGH - wrong frame for situation means mismatched response vs right frame enables appropriate action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Wrong frame for situation | HIGH | Match frame to reality vs mismatch | Match frame to reality | Defensive when should pursue, or vice versa |

| Both problem and opportunity | LOW | Complete view, address both | Address both | Over-focus on one |

---

## Q6: What's excluded by this frame?
[VOI: HIGH - important things excluded or unknown exclusions means missing crucial vs nothing important excluded enables proceeding]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Important things excluded | HIGH | Change or supplement vs miss crucial | Change or supplement | Act on incomplete, fail |
| Unknown exclusions | HIGH | Exclusion analysis vs proceed blind | Exclusion analysis | Blindsided by excluded factor |
| Know what's excluded | MED | Supplement or accept limits | Supplement or accept | Blind to blind spot |
| Nothing important excluded | LOW | Frame sufficient, use | Use as is | Actually missing important |

---

## Q7: Is the frame consistent with our values?
[VOI: HIGH - inconsistent with values means value conflict vs consistent enables aligned action]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inconsistent with values | HIGH | Reject or modify vs compromise | Reject or modify | Compromise values unknowingly |
| Values unclear | MED | Value clarification vs proceed | Value clarification | Accept value-compromising frame |
| Unknown if consistent | MED | Consistency check vs proceed | Consistency check | Unknowing value compromise |
| Consistent with values | LOW | Aligned, use | Use | Import values we reject |

---

## Q8: Is this frame falsifiable?
[VOI: HIGH - unfalsifiable frame can't learn from error vs falsifiable enables updating]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unfalsifiable | HIGH | Find falsifiable alternative vs never learn | Find falsifiable alternative | Never learn, never update |
| Unknown if falsifiable | MED | Falsifiability check vs proceed | Falsifiability check | Stuck in unfalsifiable frame |
| Falsifiable | LOW | Can learn from failure, use and update | Use and update | Think falsifiable when not |

---

## Q9: What happens if we invert the frame?
[VOI: HIGH - inversion reveals better frame means current suboptimal vs inversion reveals nothing means current sufficient]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Inversion reveals better frame | HIGH | Switch to inverted vs miss better | Switch to inverted | Miss better frame |
| Inversion reveals insights | MED | Use inversion contrast vs miss | Use inversion | Miss inversion insights |
| Haven't tried inversion | MED | Try inversion vs stay | Try inversion | Stuck in one direction |
| Inversion reveals nothing new | LOW | Current sufficient, stay | Stay with current | Actually inversion helps |

---

## Q10: Is the frame at the right level of abstraction?
[VOI: MED - too abstract/concrete affects action but can be adjusted]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Too abstract | MED | Zoom in vs philosophize | Zoom in | Philosophize without acting |
| Too concrete | MED | Zoom out vs miss point | Zoom out | Solve wrong specific problem |
| Unknown if right level | MED | Level testing vs proceed | Level testing | Wrong abstraction level |
| Right level | LOW | Actionable and meaningful, use | Use | Wrong actions or wrong target |

---

## Q11: Is reframing necessary or just different?
[VOI: HIGH - reframe would improve means currently suboptimal vs optimal means no need to change]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Reframe would improve | HIGH | Reframe vs struggle unnecessarily | Reframe | Struggle unnecessarily |
| Unknown if reframe helps | MED | Reframe testing vs proceed | Reframe testing | Either stuck or waste effort |
| Reframe would be equivalent | LOW | Change optional, stay | Either | Waste effort changing when equivalent |
| Current frame optimal | LOW | No need to change, stay | Stay | Miss better frame |

## Coverage Summary

```
QUESTIONS: 11
ENTRIES: 44

VOI Distribution:
- HIGH: 12 entries (27%)
- MED: 21 entries (48%)
- LOW: 11 entries (25%)

Note: Higher HIGH% because wrong frames make all subsequent work useless

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**HIGH VOI (ask first - routes to different action paths):**
- Q1-Q2: What frame? Serving? - current frame awareness
- Q6: Exclusions? - what's hidden
- Q3-Q4: Alternative frames? Whose? - options and ownership
- Q7-Q8: Values? Falsifiable? - frame quality
- Q5, Q9, Q11: Problem/opportunity, inversion, necessity

**MED VOI (ask second - same direction, different approach):**
- Q10: Abstraction level

---

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ frame sophistication or meta-level awareness**

**VOI = action divergence**

A question has HIGH VOI when knowing the answer changes what you do next (make frame explicit vs operate blind, reframe vs stay stuck, change to serve own interests vs serve others unknowingly). Low VOI questions refine frame usage within an established frame.
