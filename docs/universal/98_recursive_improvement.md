## VOI Rating = Action Divergence

- **HIGH**: Different answers → completely different action paths
- **MED**: Different answers → same general direction, different approach
- **LOW**: Different answers → same actions, different framing/flavor

| Moderate improvement | LOW | Normal | Continue | Different rate |
| Rapid improvement | LOW | Good momentum | Continue | Slower than thought |

---

## Q6: Are we improving the right things?

[VOI: HIGH - improving wrong things = wasted effort]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Improving wrong things | HIGH | Wasted effort | Major refocus | Focus correct |
| Unknown focus | MED | Strategic clarity | Define focus | Focus clear |
| Improving high-impact | LOW | Good prioritization | Continue | Lower impact |

---

## Q7: Do the same problems keep recurring?

[VOI: HIGH - recurring = root cause not addressed]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Same problems recur | HIGH | Root cause not addressed | Find root cause | Problems unique |
| Unknown if recurring | MED | May be missing root | Pattern analysis | Known |
| Different problems each time | LOW | Good progress | Continue | Recurring |

---

## Q8: What level should improvement happen at?

[VOI: HIGH - wrong level = low leverage]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Need framework change | HIGH | Foundational | Framework revision | Framework fine |
| Need meta-improvement | HIGH | Highest leverage | Improve the process | Lower level ok |
| Need tactical fixes | LOW | Details | Fix details | Higher level needed |
| Unknown right level | MED | Strategic decision | Choose level | Level clear |

---

## Q9: Is improvement capacity exhausted?

[VOI: MED - affects approach but similar analysis]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Capacity exhausted | MED | Ceiling reached | Find new approach | More capacity |
| Near diminishing returns | MED | May be near optimal | Consider stopping | Returns still good |
| Unknown if exhausted | MED | May be wasting | Measure capacity | Known |
| Capacity available | LOW | Can continue | Continue | Exhausted |

---

## Q10: What is the improvement cost-benefit?

[VOI: MED - affects investment but similar process]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Low benefit, high cost | MED | Poor investment | Stop or change | Good investment |
| Unknown cost-benefit | MED | Can't prioritize | Calculate ROI | Known |
| High benefit, low cost | LOW | Good investment | Continue | Different ratio |

---

## Q11: Is there improvement ownership?

[VOI: MED - affects execution but similar work]

| Entry | VOI | Action Divergence | ASSUME RIGHT | ASSUME WRONG |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|

|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Improvements fade | LOW | Need reinforcement | Add reinforcement | Stick |
| Require constant effort | LOW | Ongoing investment | Plan for effort | One-time |
| Improvements stick | LOW | Durable | Continue | Fade |

## Question Order by Action Divergence

**Ask first (HIGH VOI):**
1. Q1: Feedback loop exists? - foundational
2. Q2: Insights become actions? - loop completion
3. Q3: Actions validated? - knowing what works
4. Q4: What's the bottleneck? - where to focus
5. Q5: Measurable improvement? - stagnation check
6. Q6: Improving right things? - focus
7. Q7: Same problems recur? - root cause
8. Q8: Right improvement level? - leverage

**Ask if relevant (MED VOI):**
9. Q9: Capacity exhausted? - ceiling
10. Q10: Cost-benefit? - investment
11. Q11: Ownership? - execution

**Low priority (LOW VOI):**
12. Q12: Sustainable? - maintenance

## Key Insight

**VOI ≠ meta-sophistication. VOI = action divergence.**

"Are improvements sustainable?" affects maintenance but has LOW VOI - you do similar work.

"Is there a feedback loop at all?" has HIGH VOI - no loop means you need to build one before anything else matters.

## Meta-Improvement Priority

1. Is the feedback loop complete? (Q1-Q3)
2. What's the bottleneck? (Q4)
3. Is there improvement? (Q5)
4. Right things? (Q6)
5. Root cause? (Q7)
6. Right level? (Q8)
