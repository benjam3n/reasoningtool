name: Taxonomy Maintenance
version: "1.0.0"
domain: meta

description: |
  Systematic process for creating, updating, and maintaining taxonomies and classification systems.

purpose: |
  Ensure taxonomies remain accurate, complete, and useful over time by providing
  structured processes for additions, modifications, and consistency validation.

when_to_use:
  - Creating a new classification system
  - Updating existing taxonomy with new categories
  - Resolving inconsistencies in classification
  - Periodic taxonomy review and maintenance

when_not_to_use:
  - Ad-hoc categorization (just use tags)
  - Rapidly changing domains where formal taxonomy is overhead
  - When existing standard taxonomies exist and suffice

inputs:
  - name: taxonomy_scope
    type: string
    required: true
    description: What domain this taxonomy covers

  - name: existing_taxonomy
    type: dict
    required: false
    description: Current taxonomy if updating (null if creating new)

outputs:
  - name: updated_taxonomy
    type: dict
    description: Complete taxonomy with all categories and relationships

  - name: change_log
    type: list
    description: Record of changes made

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Scope Definition
    action: |
      Define taxonomy boundaries:
      1. What entities are being classified?
      2. What is in scope vs out of scope?
      3. What level of granularity is needed?
      4. Who are the users of this taxonomy?
      5. What decisions will it inform?

      Document: purpose statement, inclusion/exclusion criteria
    outputs:
      - scope_definition

  - id: 2
    name: Existing Structure Review
    action: |
      If updating existing taxonomy:
      1. Review current categories and hierarchy
      2. Identify known problems (gaps, overlaps, ambiguities)
      3. Collect feedback from users
      4. Note categories with edge cases

      If creating new:
      1. Research existing taxonomies in domain
      2. Identify best practices
      3. Decide: adopt, adapt, or create from scratch
    outputs:
      - current_state_assessment

  - id: 3
    name: Category Development
    action: |
      Develop/refine categories:

      Principles:
      - Mutually exclusive (items belong to one category)
      - Collectively exhaustive (all items can be classified)
      - Consistent granularity at each level
      - Meaningful distinctions (categories differ in important ways)

      For each category:
      - Name (clear, descriptive)
      - Definition (unambiguous criteria)
      - Examples (typical cases)
      - Non-examples (common misclassifications)
      - Parent/child relationships
    outputs:
      - category_definitions

  - id: 4
    name: Hierarchy Design
    action: |
      Structure the taxonomy:

      Hierarchy types:
      - Strict hierarchy (each item has one parent)
      - Polyhierarchy (items can have multiple parents)
      - Faceted (multiple independent dimensions)

      Design considerations:
      - Depth (how many levels?)
      - Breadth (how many siblings?)
      - Balance (similar detail across branches)

      Validate: Can all known entities be classified?
    outputs:
      - taxonomy_structure

  - id: 5
    name: Consistency Validation
    action: |
      Check for problems:

      Structural issues:
      - Orphan categories (no parent)
      - Empty categories (no instances)
      - Overlapping categories (ambiguous classification)
      - Missing categories (known items unclassifiable)

      Definition issues:
      - Vague criteria
      - Circular definitions
      - Inconsistent terminology

      Test: Classify 20+ diverse examples, note difficulties
    outputs:
      - validation_results
      - issues_to_resolve

  - id: 6
    name: Versioning and Change Control
    action: |
      Establish maintenance process:

      Version scheme:
      - Major: Breaking changes (restructuring, removing categories)
      - Minor: Additions (new categories)
      - Patch: Clarifications (definition improvements)

      Change process:
      1. Propose change with rationale
      2. Assess impact on existing classifications
      3. Update definitions and examples
      4. Update version number
      5. Document in change log

      Migration: How to handle items in changed categories?
    outputs:
      - versioning_scheme
      - change_process

  - id: 7
    name: Documentation
    action: |
      Create taxonomy documentation:

      For users:
      - Category list with definitions
      - Decision tree for classification
      - Examples and edge cases
      - FAQ for common questions

      For maintainers:
      - Design rationale
      - Known limitations
      - Future considerations
      - Change log
    outputs:
      - user_documentation
      - maintainer_documentation

  - id: 8
    name: Periodic Review
    action: |
      Schedule regular maintenance:

      Review triggers:
      - Calendar (quarterly, annually)
      - Threshold (X% items unclassifiable)
      - Major domain change

      Review checklist:
      - Are definitions still clear?
      - Are there new categories needed?
      - Are any categories unused?
      - Is the structure still appropriate?
      - User feedback since last review?

verification:
  - All categories have clear definitions
  - Test cases classify unambiguously
  - No orphan or duplicate categories
  - Version and change log maintained

failure_modes:
  - mode: Category proliferation
    symptom: Too many categories, hard to use
    resolution: Merge similar categories, use broader groupings

  - mode: Ambiguous boundaries
    symptom: Items could fit multiple categories
    resolution: Sharpen definitions, add decision criteria

  - mode: Stale taxonomy
    symptom: Many items don't fit existing categories
    resolution: Schedule regular review, add feedback mechanism

examples:
  - name: AI Risk Taxonomy
    description: Classifying AI safety concerns
    context: Maintaining alignment research categorization
    inputs:
      taxonomy_scope: "AI safety risks and research approaches"
      existing_taxonomy: {categories: ["alignment", "capabilities", "governance"]}
    process: |
      1. Scope: AI risks relevant to safety research prioritization
      2. Review: Current 3-category system too coarse
      3. Categories: Add subcategories (deception, mesa-optimization, etc.)
      4. Hierarchy: 2-level with 3 top-level, 15 subcategories
      5. Validate: Test against 50 recent papers
      6. Version: 2.0 (major restructuring)
      7. Document: Decision tree for paper classification
    expected_output: |

      - Classification guide for researchers
      - Change log documenting evolution
