domain: meta
version: "1.0.0"
tags: ["review", "questions", "self-examination", "weekly", "meta"]

description: |
  A 24-week rotating list of questions for weekly review. Each week, engage with
  one question from the current category. After cycling through all categories,
  start again.

  Categories cover: Situation, Goals, Strategy, Values, Action, and Meta.

  The rotation ensures systematic coverage of all important domains without
  overwhelming any single review session.

usage: |
  1. At the start of each week, note which question is current
  2. During weekly review, spend 5-10 minutes genuinely engaging with the question
  3. Write down thoughts, even if incomplete
  4. Note any implications for action
  5. If a question doesn't resonate, note why and adapt
  6. After 24 weeks, review patterns in answers and update rotation if needed
