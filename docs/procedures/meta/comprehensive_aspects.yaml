description: |
  Meta-procedure for ensuring any analysis, procedure, or decision
  covers all relevant aspects without blind spots.

  Apply this AFTER creating any procedure/analysis to verify completeness.
  Apply this DURING analysis to ensure you're not missing angles.

core_principle: |
  Incomplete analysis leads to incomplete solutions.
  The aspects you don't consider are the ones that bite you.

  But: Not every aspect is relevant to every situation.
  Comprehensive doesn't mean exhaustive - it means "no blind spots."

# ============================================
# UNIVERSAL ASPECTS
# These apply to almost everything
# ============================================
universal_aspects:

  # WHO
  - category: actors
    questions:
      - "Who is affected by this?"

      - "Who benefits? Who is harmed?"
      - "Who is missing from this analysis?"
      - "Whose perspective haven't we considered?"
    blind_spot: "Assuming your perspective is the only one"

  # WHAT
  - category: scope
    questions:
      - "What exactly are we talking about?"
      - "What is included? What is excluded?"
      - "What are the boundaries?"
      - "What are we assuming is out of scope that might not be?"
    blind_spot: "Vague scope that shifts during analysis"

  # WHEN
  - category: temporal
    questions:
      - "When does this apply?"
      - "When did this start? When might it end?"
      - "What's the timeline?"

      - "Is this urgent? Is there a window?"
    blind_spot: "Treating dynamic situations as static"

  # WHERE
  - category: context
    questions:
      - "Where does this apply?"
      - "What context makes this true/false?"
      - "What conditions must hold?"
      - "Where does this NOT apply?"
    blind_spot: "Overgeneralizing from specific context"

  # WHY
  - category: purpose
    questions:
      - "Why does this matter?"
      - "Why are we doing this?"
      - "What's the goal?"
      - "What happens if we don't?"
    blind_spot: "Losing sight of purpose, solving wrong problem"

  # HOW
  - category: mechanism
    questions:
      - "How does this work?"
      - "How would we do this?"
      - "What's the mechanism/process?"

# ============================================
# USAGE
# ============================================
usage:
  when_to_apply: |
    1. After creating any procedure - check for missing aspects
    2. After making any decision - verify completeness
    3. When something feels off - find the blind spot
    4. Before committing significant resources - comprehensive check

  how_to_apply: |
    1. Select relevant aspect categories (not all apply to everything)
    2. Ask each question in selected categories
    3. Note any aspects that reveal gaps
    4. Address gaps or document why they don't apply

  efficiency: |
    Don't mechanically ask every question for every situation.

    Instead:
    - Skim categories, note which seem relevant
    - Focus on questions that feel uncomfortable
    - The aspects you want to skip are often the important ones

  output: |
    Either:
    - "Comprehensive check passed - these aspects covered: [list]"
    - "Gap found in [aspect] - need to address: [what]"

# ============================================
# QUICK CHECKLIST
# For rapid completeness check
# ============================================
quick_checklist:
  - "Who's affected that we haven't considered?"
  - "What's out of scope that shouldn't be?"
  - "What are we assuming without questioning?"
  - "What's the opposite view?"
  - "What could go wrong?"
  - "What would change our mind?"
  - "Is this actionable?"
  - "Is this the right level?"
