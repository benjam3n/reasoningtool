description: Systematic procedure for preparing and delivering impactful presentations, speeches, and talks

long_description: |
  The Public Speaking procedure provides a comprehensive framework for preparing,
  practicing, and delivering effective presentations across various contexts including
  conference talks, team meetings, executive briefings, and keynote speeches.

  This procedure integrates:
  - Content preparation (structuring ideas for maximum impact)
  - Delivery techniques (voice, body language, pacing)
  - Audience engagement (connecting and adapting in real-time)
  - Anxiety management (channeling nerves into energy)
  - Q&A handling (responding effectively under pressure)

  Key principles:
  - Know your audience and their context deeply
  - One core message, repeated and reinforced
  - Stories and examples trump abstract concepts
  - Practice out loud, not just in your head
  - Nervousness is energy waiting to be channeled

# PROCEDURE
# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Analyze audience and context
    action: |
      Before creating any content, understand your audience deeply:
      1. Who will be in the room? (roles, demographics, group size)
      2. What do they already know about this topic?
      3. What do they expect from this presentation?
      4. What are their pain points or concerns related to your topic?
      5. What would make this talk valuable TO THEM?
      6. What's the physical/virtual setup? (room size, AV, remote)
      7. What happens before and after your talk? (context matters)
    inputs:
      - audience
      - context (optional)
    outputs:
      - audience_profile: detailed understanding of who you're speaking to
      - context_analysis: physical and situational factors
      - audience_needs: what they want to gain from your talk
    verification: |
      Can describe what success looks like from the AUDIENCE's perspective
      Know the room setup and technical constraints

  - id: 2
    name: Define your core message
    action: |
      Distill your talk to one essential message:
      1. If the audience remembers only ONE thing, what should it be?
      2. Write your core message in one sentence (15 words or less)
      3. Test: Would someone who missed your talk understand it from this sentence?
      4. This message should appear at least 3 times in your talk
      5. All content should support or illustrate this message
      6. If content doesn't serve the core message, cut it
    inputs:
      - topic
      - desired_outcome
      - audience_needs (from Step 1)
    outputs:
      - core_message: single sentence capturing your main point
      - supporting_themes: 2-4 sub-points that reinforce the core message
    verification: |
      Core message is memorable and fits in one sentence
      Can explain why this message matters to THIS audience

  - id: 3
    name: Structure your content
    action: |
      Build the architecture of your talk:

      Opening (10-15% of time):
      - Hook: Grab attention in first 30 seconds (story, question, surprising fact)
      - Establish credibility and relevance
      - Preview: Tell them what you'll tell them
      - State your core message

      Body (70-80% of time):
      - Limit to 3 main points (audiences can't absorb more)
      - Each point follows: Claim -> Evidence -> Example -> Relevance
      - Include stories and concrete examples (not just abstract concepts)
      - Build in transitions between sections
      - Return to core message after each main point

      Close (10-15% of time):
      - Signal you're concluding ("In closing..." not "So, yeah...")
      - Summarize: Tell them what you told them
      - Restate core message powerfully
      - Call to action: What should they do with this information?
      - Strong final line (not "Any questions?")
    inputs:
      - duration
      - core_message (from Step 2)
      - supporting_themes (from Step 2)
    outputs:

      No more than 3 main points in body
      Each main point has at least one concrete example or story

  - id: 4
    name: Develop stories and examples
    action: |
      Make abstract concepts concrete and memorable:
      1. For each main point, find at least one specific story or example
      2. Stories should have: character, conflict, resolution, lesson
      3. Use the "STAR" format: Situation, Task, Action, Result
      4. Personal stories are more compelling than hypotheticals
      5. Make examples relevant to THIS audience's experience
      6. Include sensory details that help people visualize
      7. Practice telling each story until it flows naturally
    inputs:
      - presentation_outline (from Step 3)
      - audience_profile (from Step 1)
    outputs:
      - story_library: developed stories and examples for each point
      - example_alternatives: backup examples if main ones don't land

      Can tell each story without notes

  - id: 5
    name: Create visual aids (if applicable)
    action: |
      Design slides or visuals that enhance, not compete with, your message:
      1. Slides support YOU, not replace you (you are the presentation)
      2. One idea per slide maximum
      3. Use images over text whenever possible
      4. If using text: 6 words or fewer per slide
      5. No bullet points if you can avoid them
      6. Data should be visualized, not shown in tables
      7. Use consistent, simple design (no busy templates)
      8. Include blank/pause slides for key moments
      9. Number slides for easy navigation during Q&A
    inputs:
      - presentation_outline (from Step 3)

  - id: 6
    name: Prepare for Q&A
    action: |
      Anticipate and prepare for audience questions:
      1. List 10 questions you might be asked (hardest ones first)
      2. Prepare concise answers for each (30-60 seconds)
      3. Practice bridging from hostile questions to your message
      4. Prepare "I don't know" responses that maintain credibility
      5. Plan for common Q&A challenges (tangential questions, hostile questioners)
      6. Prepare 2-3 questions to seed if audience is quiet
      7. Decide how you'll handle questions during vs after the talk

    name: Practice delivery
    action: |
      Rehearse until delivery is natural, not memorized:

      Practice sequence:
      1. Read through silently (content familiarization)
      2. Talk through sections out loud (find your words)
      3. Full run-through standing up with slides (timing)
      4. Record yourself and review (identify weak spots)
      5. Practice in front of someone and get feedback
      6. Final run-throughs focusing on weak spots

      Delivery elements to practice:
      - Opening: Practice until it's automatic under stress
      - Transitions: Know exactly how to move between sections
      - Stories: Tell them until they flow naturally
      - Closing: Memorize your final line word-for-word
      - Timing: Know which sections to cut if running long

      Volume: Minimum 3 full run-throughs, more for important talks

  - id: 8
    name: Manage nerves and energy
    action: |
      Channel anxiety into positive energy:

      Before the talk:

      - Power pose: 2 minutes of expansive posture before going on
      - Visualize success: See yourself delivering confidently

      During the talk:
      - Focus on serving the audience, not on yourself
      - Find friendly faces to speak to
      - If you lose your place, pause and breathe (feels longer to you)
      - Move purposefully to channel nervous energy
      - Remember: Audience wants you to succeed

      After the talk:
      - Adrenaline will spike - this is normal

    action: |
      Execute your preparation with presence and connection:

      Physical presence:
      - Stand grounded, feet shoulder-width apart
      - Make eye contact (3-5 seconds per person, or sections for large rooms)
      - Use purposeful gestures (avoid fidgeting or repetitive movements)
      - Move with intention (not pacing)
      - Vary your position in the room

      Vocal delivery:
      - Speak louder and slower than feels natural
      - Pause before and after key points (silence is powerful)
      - Vary pace and pitch to maintain interest

      - Read the room and adapt (energy level, confusion, engagement)
      - Ask questions to involve the audience
      - Acknowledge reactions (laughter, nodding, confusion)
      - Be genuinely present, not performing a script
    inputs:
      - presentation_outline (from Step 3)
      - visual_aids (from Step 5)

      - Listen fully before formulating response
      - Repeat or paraphrase question for large audiences
      - Thank the questioner genuinely (not perfunctorily)
      - If unclear, ask for clarification

      Answering questions:
      - Keep answers concise (30-60 seconds typical)
      - Structure: Answer, Evidence, Bridge back to message
      - It's okay to say "I don't know, but I'll find out"
      - Redirect off-topic questions: "That's interesting - let's discuss offline"
      - Address the whole room, not just the questioner

      Difficult situations:
      - Hostile questioner: Stay calm, acknowledge their point, bridge to your message
      - Long-winded questioner: Wait for breath, summarize their question, answer briefly
      - No questions: Ask your seeded question, or "A question I often get is..."
      - Wrong question: Answer the question they should have asked
    inputs:
      - anticipated_questions (from Step 6)

      8. Watch recording if available (painful but valuable)
    inputs:
      - delivery_execution (from Step 9)
      - qa_performance (from Step 10)
    outputs:
      - delivery_notes: structured reflection and improvement areas

# ============================================
# DELIVERY TECHNIQUES
# ============================================
delivery_techniques:
  voice:
    volume:
      principle: "Speak louder than conversational - it conveys confidence"
      technique: "Project to the back of the room, not to the front row"
      common_mistake: "Speaking too softly, especially when nervous"

    pace:
      principle: "Slower feels more confident and allows processing"
      technique: "Aim for 120-150 words per minute (conversation is 180+)"
      common_mistake: "Racing through material when nervous"

    pauses:
      principle: "Silence is powerful - use it strategically"
      technique: "Pause before key points, after questions, to let ideas land"
      common_mistake: "Filling silence with 'um' or rushing through"

    variety:
      principle: "Monotone loses audiences - vary pitch, pace, volume"
      technique: "Speed up for excitement, slow down for emphasis, raise pitch for questions"
      common_mistake: "Speaking in the same tone throughout"

  body_language:
    eye_contact:
      principle: "Connection happens through the eyes"
      technique: "3-5 seconds per person, cover all sections of room"
      common_mistake: "Looking at slides, ceiling, or just one section"

    posture:
      principle: "How you stand affects how you feel and how you're perceived"
      technique: "Feet planted, shoulders back, weight centered"
      common_mistake: "Shifting weight, crossing arms, hunching"

    gestures:
      principle: "Purposeful movement reinforces message"
      technique: "Use open gestures that match your words, hands visible"
      common_mistake: "Hands in pockets, repetitive gestures, fidgeting"

    movement:
      principle: "Strategic movement holds attention and shows confidence"
      technique: "Move toward audience for key points, use stage purposefully"
      common_mistake: "Pacing nervously, staying frozen behind podium"

  engagement:
    questions:
      types:
        - "Rhetorical: 'Have you ever...?' (no answer expected)"
        - "Polling: 'How many of you...?' (hands raised)"
        - "Direct: 'What do you think about...?' (specific answer)"
      technique: "Use questions to re-engage attention every 10 minutes"

    interaction:
      types:
        - "Turn to neighbor and discuss"
        - "Quick poll or show of hands"
        - "Invite questions during the talk"
        - "Live demonstration with volunteer"
      technique: "Build in interaction points for talks over 20 minutes"

    reading_the_room:
      signs_of_engagement: "Eye contact, nodding, leaning forward, note-taking"
      signs_of_disengagement: "Phone checking, slouching, side conversations, glazed eyes"
      response: "Adjust pace, ask a question, move to a story, or acknowledge directly"

# ============================================
# HANDLING CHALLENGES
# ============================================
challenging_situations:
  technical_failures:
    slides_fail:
      response: "Your talk should work without slides - proceed confidently"
      prevention: "Know your content, have backup (printed notes, PDF on phone)"

    microphone_fails:
      response: "Project naturally, move closer to audience, or wait for fix"
      prevention: "Test equipment before, have backup plan"

    time_cut:
      response: "Know what to cut, skip to conclusion gracefully"
      prevention: "Have cut list prepared, know timing checkpoints"

  audience_challenges:
    hostile_questioner:
      response: |
        - Stay calm and don't get defensive
        - Acknowledge their point: "That's a valid concern..."
        - Bridge to your message: "What I've found is..."
        - Offer to continue offline if needed
      prevention: "Anticipate objections and address proactively in your talk"

    silent_audience:
      response: |
        - Ask an easier question first
        - Use think-pair-share (discuss with neighbor first)
        - Seed with "A question I often get is..."
        - Allow longer wait time (count to 10)
      prevention: "Build in low-risk interaction early to warm them up"

    distracted_audience:
      response: |
        - Change something: move, change volume, ask a question
        - Tell a story (stories recapture attention)
        - Address directly: "I want to make sure this is valuable..."
        - Cut to the most important content
      prevention: "Build in engagement points every 7-10 minutes"

  speaker_challenges:
    losing_place:
      response: |
        - Pause and breathe (feels longer to you than them)
        - Glance at notes or slides
        - Summarize what you've covered: "So, we've discussed..."
        - Move to the next point you remember
      prevention: "Know your transitions cold, have clear notes"

    going_overtime:
      response: |
        - Skip to your conclusion
        - Summarize remaining points briefly
        - Never say "I'm running out of time"
        - Land your closing strongly
      prevention: "Know timing checkpoints, have cut list ready"

    mind_blank:
      response: |
        - Take a breath and a sip of water
        - Ask the audience a question
        - Repeat your last point to buy time
        - It feels much longer to you than to them
      prevention: "Memorize opening and key transitions"

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - Core message is clear and stated multiple times
  - Opening grabs attention in first 30 seconds
  - No more than 3 main points in the body
  - Each point has at least one concrete story or example
  - Closing is strong and includes call to action
  - Practiced at least 3 times out loud
  - Prepared for likely Q&A questions
  - Timing has been checked and fits allocation

failure_modes:
  - mode: Information overload
    symptom: Too many points, audience glazes over, nothing is memorable
    resolution: Ruthlessly cut to 3 main points supporting one core message

  - mode: Abstract concepts without examples
    symptom: Audience nods but doesn't connect or remember
    resolution: Add specific stories and examples for every main point

  - mode: Weak opening
    symptom: Starting with "Today I'm going to talk about..." or throat-clearing
    resolution: Craft a hook (story, question, surprising fact) and memorize it

  - mode: Trailing close
    symptom: Ending with "So, yeah..." or "Any questions?"
    resolution: Memorize a strong final line and signal conclusion clearly

  - mode: Reading slides
    symptom: Back to audience, reading text from slides
    resolution: Reduce slide text to 6 words max, know content without slides

  - mode: Monotonous delivery
    symptom: Same pace, pitch, and energy throughout, audience disengages
    resolution: Practice varying voice, add strategic pauses, move purposefully

  - mode: Under-preparation
    symptom: Fumbling, losing place, running over time, weak Q&A
    resolution: Minimum 3 full run-throughs, practice out loud not just in head

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: Conference presentation on technical topic
    context: 30-minute talk at industry conference, 200 attendees, mixed experience levels
    inputs:
      topic: "Implementing observability in microservices"
      audience: "200 software engineers, mixed senior/junior, at DevOps conference"
      duration: 30
      context: "conference"
      desired_outcome: "Attendees leave with 3 actionable practices they can implement Monday"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Audience Analysis:
      - 200 engineers, varied experience (30% junior, 50% mid, 20% senior)
      - They know microservices basics, want practical guidance
      - Pain points: debugging distributed systems, alert fatigue, tool overwhelm
      - They want: actionable takeaways, not theory

      Step 2 - Core Message:
      "Effective observability starts with three pillars: logs, metrics, and traces
      working together, not separately."

      Step 3 - Structure:
      - Opening (4 min): Story of 3am incident, hook with pain point
      - Point 1 (7 min): Logs - structured logging, what to log, example
      - Point 2 (7 min): Metrics - key metrics, alerting principles, example
      - Point 3 (7 min): Traces - distributed tracing, connecting the pillars, example
      - Close (5 min): Summary, 3 actions for Monday, resources

      Step 4 - Stories:
      - Opening: My worst 3am incident and what I learned
      - Logs: How structured logging cut our debug time by 60%
      - Metrics: The alert that cried wolf (alert fatigue story)
      - Traces: Finding the needle - one trace that saved us

      Step 7 - Practice:
      - 5 full run-throughs over 2 weeks
      - Recorded and reviewed once

  - name: Executive briefing on project status
    context: 15-minute update to C-suite on project progress and blockers
    inputs:
      topic: "Q2 platform migration project status"
      audience: "5 C-level executives, limited technical depth, focused on business impact"
      duration: 15
      context: "executive_briefing"
      desired_outcome: "Get approval for additional resources and timeline extension"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Audience Analysis:
      - Busy executives, want bottom line first
      - Limited time for details, will ask questions if interested
      - Care about: timeline, budget, risk, business impact
      - Decision-makers for resources requested

      Step 2 - Core Message:
      "We're on track for success, but need 2 additional engineers and 3 more weeks
      to manage risk and ensure quality."

      Step 3 - Structure (BLUF format for executives):
      - Bottom Line (2 min): Status, ask, recommendation
      - Context (3 min): Where we are, what's changed
      - Details (5 min): Progress, risks, mitigation
      - Ask (3 min): Specific request with rationale
      - Discussion (2 min): Buffer for questions

      Step 6 - Q&A Prep:
      - "Why didn't we anticipate this?" (scope discovered during migration)
      - "What happens if we don't extend?" (quality risk, technical debt)
      - "Can we cut scope instead?" (yes, here are options)
      - "What's the cost of delay?" (quantified business impact)
    expected_output:
      presentation_outline:
        bottom_line:
          status: "70% complete, on budget, need timeline adjustment"
          ask: "2 additional engineers, 3-week extension"
          recommendation: "Approve to ensure quality and manage risk"
          time: "2 minutes"
        context:
          where_we_are: "Key milestones completed"
          what_changed: "Technical complexity discovered"
          time: "3 minutes"
        details:
          progress: "Completed phases with metrics"
          risks: "Top 3 risks with likelihood and impact"
          mitigation: "How additional resources address risks"
          time: "5 minutes"
        ask:
          request: "Specific resources and timeline"
          rationale: "Why this is the right investment"
          alternatives: "Options if request not approved"
