# Targeting Procedure - Building advocacy target database
# GOSM procedure for identifying and profiling outreach targets

domain: advocacy

description: Build comprehensive database of advocacy targets with personalized dossiers

long_description: |
  The Targeting procedure builds a prioritized database of legislative staff,
  legislators, and other influencers to contact for advocacy campaigns. It
  emphasizes staff over legislators for higher accessibility and real influence.

  Effective targeting is the foundation of efficient advocacy. By focusing on
  the right people with personalized approaches, campaigns achieve higher
  response rates and more meaningful engagement.

  Key principles:
  - Staff are gatekeepers with significant policy influence
  - Prioritization ensures effort goes to highest-value targets
  - Personalization dramatically improves response rates
  - Comprehensive dossiers enable informed conversations
  - Tiered approach balances depth with coverage

tags:
  - advocacy
  - targeting
  - outreach
  - staff
  - legislators
  - dossiers

# ============================================
# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:
  - After selecting policies for advocacy campaigns
  - When building outreach target database from scratch
  - Refreshing target list for new legislative session

      - interests, profile_notes
      - tier, status (default: "not_contacted")

      Verify data integrity:
      - No duplicate entries
      - All required fields populated
      - Email format validated
    inputs:
      - tier_1_dossiers (from Step 4)
      - tier_2_profiles (from Step 5)
      - tier_3_contacts (from Step 6)
    outputs:
      - target_database: complete database records
      - data_quality_report: validation results
    verification: |
      50+ targets in database; all required fields populated

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - At least 50 targets identified across all tiers
  - All Tier 1 targets have comprehensive dossiers with opportunity analysis
  - All Tier 2 targets have verified contact information
  - Personalization notes are specific to individuals, not generic templates
  - Committee coverage is complete for all selected policies
  - Database is fully populated with validated data
  - Tier distribution matches targets (15-20 T1, 20-30 T2, 10+ T3)

failure_modes:
  - mode: Staff turnover invalidates data
    symptom: Emails bouncing, wrong people in roles
    resolution: Verify key contacts before campaign launch; check LegiStorm for recent changes

  - mode: Contact information incomplete
    symptom: Missing emails or phones for key targets
    resolution: Try multiple sources (LegiStorm, LinkedIn, direct office calls); use standard email format

  - mode: Personalization too generic
    symptom: Outreach reads like form letter despite personalization
    resolution: Reference specific votes, statements, or recent activity; make opening sentence unique

  - mode: Tier 1 overloaded
    symptom: Too many targets in Tier 1, can't research all thoroughly
    resolution: Strict scoring cutoff; better to have fewer deep dossiers than many shallow ones

  - mode: Committee mapping errors
    symptom: Targeting staff on wrong committees
    resolution: Verify committee jurisdiction on congress.gov; check recent hearings

  - mode: Accessibility misjudged
    symptom: Targeting legislators directly when staff more accessible
    resolution: Default to staff; only move to legislator if staff unresponsive after 2+ attempts

        Policy focus: Pretrial justice, sentencing reform
        Recent activity: Staffed hearing on bail reform (March 2024)
        Opportunity: Strong alignment with reform; helped draft previous bail bill
        Objection prep: May want to wait for CBO score on new bill
        Best framing: Evidence from Arnold Foundation studies
        Ask: 15-minute briefing on latest research

      Step 5-6: Completed profiles and contact lists

      Step 7: Personalization for Sarah Johnson
        Hook: "Following your excellent questions at the March hearing on
               pretrial detention costs..."
        Relevance: "The new Arnold Foundation data directly addresses
                   the CBO scoring question you raised"
        Value: "We can provide a summary memo comparing state implementations"
        Ask: "Would 15 minutes work to walk through the key findings?"
