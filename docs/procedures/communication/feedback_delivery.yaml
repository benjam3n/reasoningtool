description: Systematic procedure for delivering feedback that is heard, received, and acted upon, and for receiving feedback gracefully

long_description: |
  The Feedback Delivery procedure provides a framework for giving and receiving
  feedback in a way that improves performance, strengthens relationships, and
  creates growth. Poor feedback damages relationships; effective feedback
  transforms them.

  This procedure covers:
  - SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact) for clear, specific feedback
  - Radical Candor framework (caring personally while challenging directly)
  - Receiving feedback (hearing without defending)
  - Performance conversations (formal reviews and development discussions)
  - Real-time feedback (in-the-moment coaching)

  Key principles:
  - Feedback is a gift, even when it's uncomfortable
  - Care personally AND challenge directly (not one or the other)
  - Specific is kind, vague is cruel
  - Timely feedback is more valuable than perfect feedback
  - How you deliver is as important as what you deliver

# ============================================
# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:
  - Providing performance feedback to direct reports
  - Giving peer feedback on work or collaboration
  - Delivering constructive criticism that might be difficult to hear
  - Sharing positive feedback and recognition
  - Receiving feedback from managers, peers, or reports
  - Conducting formal performance reviews
  - Coaching in real-time after observing something
  - Addressing behavior that needs to change
  - Following up on previous feedback conversations

when_not_to_use:
  - When you're too angry or upset to be constructive
  - In public settings where it would embarrass the recipient
  - When you don't have specific observations (just vague impressions)
  - For systemic issues requiring process change, not individual feedback
  - When the issue is a one-time mistake that's already been corrected
  - If the feedback is really about your preferences, not their performance

# PROCEDURE
# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Assess the feedback situation
    action: |
      Before preparing feedback, assess the context:

      Situation assessment:
      1. What type of feedback is this? (developmental, reinforcing, corrective)
      2. How urgent is this? (needs immediate attention vs can wait for right moment)
      3. What's the relationship context? (new hire vs tenured, trust level)
      4. What's their likely receptivity? (open to feedback vs defensive)
      5. Is this a pattern or a one-time event?
      6. What's the potential impact if not addressed?

      Self-assessment:
      1. Am I calm enough to deliver this constructively?
      2. Is this about their performance or my preferences?
      3. Am I trying to help them or just vent frustration?
      4. Do I have specific observations, not just impressions?
      5. Am I willing to hear their perspective?
      6. Is my intent to help them grow?

      Check your position on Radical Candor grid:
      - Caring personally + Challenging directly = Radical Candor (goal)
      - Caring personally + Not challenging = Ruinous Empathy (feels nice, doesn't help)
      - Not caring + Challenging directly = Obnoxious Aggression (damages relationship)
      - Not caring + Not challenging = Manipulative Insincerity (worst of all)
    inputs:
      - feedback_type
      - recipient
      - relationship_context (optional)
    outputs:
      - feedback_assessment: type, urgency, and context
      - readiness_check: your mental state and intent
      - candor_position: where you are on caring/challenging grid
    verification: |
      Confirmed this is about their growth, not your frustration
      Have specific observations, not vague impressions
      In the right mental state to deliver constructively

  - id: 2
    name: Prepare feedback using SBI model
    action: |
      Structure feedback using Situation-Behavior-Impact:

      SITUATION: When and where did this happen?
      - Be specific: "In yesterday's client meeting..."
      - Not vague: "Recently..." or "Sometimes you..."
      - Helps them recall the specific instance

      BEHAVIOR: What specific behavior did you observe?
      - Observable actions, not interpretations
      - "You interrupted three times" not "You were rude"
      - "You delivered the report two days late" not "You're unreliable"
      - Avoid: character judgments, mind-reading, generalizations

      IMPACT: What was the effect of this behavior?
      - On you: "I felt frustrated because..."
      - On others: "The team lost confidence in..."
      - On outcomes: "This caused the client to question..."
      - Be honest about impact, don't exaggerate or minimize

      For reinforcing feedback (positive):
      - Same structure: what they did well and why it mattered
      - "In the presentation yesterday, when you handled the tough question calmly, it reassured the whole room and we won the deal"

      Prepare multiple SBI examples if this is a pattern
    inputs:
      - specific_observations
      - feedback_type
    outputs:
      - sbi_feedback: structured feedback with situation, behavior, impact
      - supporting_examples: additional instances if pattern
    verification: |
      Behavior is specific and observable (not interpretation)
      Impact is honest and connected to behavior
      No character judgments or generalizations

  - id: 3
    name: Plan the conversation
    action: |
      Prepare how you'll deliver the feedback:

      Timing:
      - Soon after the event (timely feedback is more valuable)
      - But not when either of you is emotional or rushed
      - Private setting for constructive feedback
      - For reinforcing feedback, can be public if appropriate

      Opening approach:
      - State your intent: "I want to share some feedback that I think will help"
      - Ask permission if peer: "Can I share an observation from the meeting?"
      - Set collaborative tone: "I care about your success and want to help"
      - For positive: "I wanted to tell you something I noticed..."

      Conversation structure:
      1. Open with care and intent
      2. Deliver SBI feedback clearly
      3. PAUSE - let them respond
      4. Listen to their perspective
      5. Discuss what to do differently (for developmental/corrective)
      6. Agree on path forward
      7. Express confidence and support

      Prepare for resistance:
      - They may have context you don't know
      - They may be defensive initially
      - Stay curious: "Help me understand..."
      - Don't back down from the feedback, but listen to their view
    inputs:
      - sbi_feedback (from Step 2)
      - feedback_setting (optional)
      - recipient
    outputs:
      - conversation_plan: structured approach for the conversation
      - opening_statement: how you'll begin
      - resistance_responses: how to handle defensiveness
    verification: |
      Have a clear, caring opening statement
      Prepared to listen to their perspective
      Know how to maintain message if they push back

  - id: 4
    name: Deliver the feedback
    action: |
      Execute the feedback conversation:

      Delivery principles:
      - Be direct but kind (don't bury the message in softeners)
      - Use "I" language ("I observed" not "You always")
      - Maintain eye contact and open body language
      - Speak calmly and at measured pace
      - Pause after key points to let them land

      The conversation:
      1. Open: "I have some feedback I think will be helpful. Can we talk now?"
      2. Deliver SBI: State situation, behavior, and impact clearly
      3. Pause: Give them space to respond
      4. Listen: Hear their perspective without defending
      5. Discuss: Explore what happened and what could be different
      6. Agree: "Going forward, what will you do differently?"
      7. Support: "How can I help you with this?"
      8. Close: "I appreciate you hearing this. I believe in your ability to..."

      If they get defensive:
      - Acknowledge their feeling: "I can see this is hard to hear"
      - Restate your intent: "I'm sharing this because I want to help you succeed"
      - Stay with the facts: "What I observed was..."
      - Invite dialogue: "Help me understand what was going on for you"

      If you delivered it wrong:
      - It's okay to pause and reset: "Let me try that again"
      - Acknowledge if you were unclear: "I don't think I said that well"
    inputs:
      - conversation_plan (from Step 3)
      - sbi_feedback (from Step 2)
    outputs:
      - conversation_summary: what was said and how it was received
      - their_perspective: what they shared in response
      - agreements_made: what they committed to do differently
    verification: |
      Delivered specific, behavioral feedback
      Listened to their perspective
      Reached some agreement on path forward

  - id: 5
    name: Discuss development path
    action: |
      Move from feedback to forward action:

      For developmental/corrective feedback:
      1. Ask their ideas first: "What do you think you could do differently?"
      2. Build on their ideas: "Yes, and you might also try..."
      3. Offer specific suggestions if they're stuck
      4. Make it actionable: "What specifically will you do next time?"
      5. Discuss how to practice: "When's the next opportunity to try this?"

      Creating accountability:
      - "What will success look like?"
      - "How will you know if it's working?"
      - "What support do you need?"
      - "When should we check in on this?"

      For reinforcing feedback:
      - Help them understand WHY it worked
      - Discuss how to replicate in other situations
      - Ask how they can share this skill with others

      Avoid:
      - Prescribing solutions without their input
      - Vague suggestions ("just be more collaborative")
      - Creating dependency ("check with me before every meeting")
    inputs:
      - conversation_summary (from Step 4)
      - desired_outcome
    outputs:
      - development_plan: specific actions and practice opportunities
      - success_criteria: how you'll both know it's working
      - support_offered: how you'll help them succeed
    verification: |
      Action plan is specific and actionable
      They contributed to the solution
      Clear check-in scheduled

  - id: 6
    name: Follow up and reinforce
    action: |
      Complete the feedback loop:

      Immediate follow-up (same day or next):
      - Send brief note thanking them for the conversation
      - Summarize key agreements in writing
      - Reaffirm your support and confidence

      Ongoing follow-up:
      - Look for evidence of change (notice and acknowledge it)
      - Give reinforcing feedback when you see improvement
      - Check in at agreed interval
      - Provide coaching if they're struggling

      If no improvement:
      - Have another conversation, more direct
      - Discuss pattern: "We talked about this before and I'm still seeing..."
      - Explore obstacles: "What's getting in the way?"
      - May need to escalate severity of consequences

      Document:
      - Keep notes on feedback conversations
      - Track agreements and follow-through
      - Useful for performance reviews and development planning
    inputs:
      - development_plan (from Step 5)
      - agreements_made (from Step 4)
    outputs:
      - follow_up_plan: scheduled check-ins and what to look for
      - feedback_notes: documentation of conversation and agreements
    verification: |
      Follow-up is scheduled
      Looking for opportunities to reinforce improvement

# ============================================
# RECEIVING FEEDBACK
# ============================================
receiving_feedback:
  mindset:
    - "Feedback is data, not attack"
    - "They're telling you something useful, even if it's hard to hear"
    - "Getting feedback is how you grow"
    - "It takes courage to give feedback - appreciate it"
    - "Your first reaction is rarely your best reaction"

  in_the_moment:
    listen:
      - "Listen fully without formulating your defense"
      - "Take notes if helpful (shows you're taking it seriously)"
      - "Notice your physical reactions (tensing up, heart racing)"
      - "Let them finish before responding"

    clarify:
      - "'Can you give me a specific example?'"
      - "'When you say X, what do you mean by that?'"
      - "'What would you like to see instead?'"
      - "'Help me understand the impact...'"

    acknowledge:
      - "'Thank you for telling me'"
      - "'I can see how that would be frustrating'"
      - "'I hadn't realized that was the impact'"
      - "You don't have to agree to acknowledge"

    avoid:
      - "Don't defend immediately ('But I...')"
      - "Don't explain away ('The reason was...')"
      - "Don't deflect ('Well, you also...')"
      - "Don't dismiss ('That's just your opinion')"

  after:
    process:
      - "Take time before responding if you need it"
      - "Assume at least some of it is valid"
      - "Ask others if they see the same thing"
      - "Separate valid criticism from unfair attack"

    respond:
      - "Follow up with thanks (even if it was hard)"
      - "Share what you're going to do differently"
      - "Ask for their help: 'Can you let me know if you see improvement?'"

    if_unfair:
      - "You can disagree after reflection, but do so calmly"
      - "'I've thought about this, and I see it differently because...'"
      - "Seek input from others to reality-check"
      - "If pattern of unfair feedback, address the pattern"

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - Feedback is specific (SBI or similar structure)
  - Behavior is observable, not interpreted
  - Delivered with care for the person
  - Listened to their perspective
  - Agreed on specific actions forward
  - Follow-up is planned
  - Documentation captured

failure_modes:
  - mode: Vague feedback
    symptom: '"You need to be more collaborative" with no specifics'
    resolution: Use SBI to provide specific situation, behavior, and impact

  - mode: Character attack
    symptom: '"You''re unreliable" (judging character, not behavior)'
    resolution: Focus on observable behaviors and their impact

  - mode: Feedback sandwich
    symptom: Burying criticism between compliments, message gets lost
    resolution: Be direct; separate positive and developmental feedback

  - mode: Delayed feedback
    symptom: Waiting months to address issue, details forgotten
    resolution: Give feedback as close to the event as possible

  - mode: Public criticism
    symptom: Calling out problems in front of others
    resolution: Praise in public, critique in private

  - mode: Ruinous empathy
    symptom: Avoiding hard feedback because you don't want to hurt feelings
    resolution: Remember that honest feedback is a gift; silence doesn't help them

  - mode: Hit and run
    symptom: Delivering feedback and leaving without discussion or support
    resolution: Make it a conversation; listen and plan together

  - mode: No follow-up
    symptom: Feedback given but never revisited
    resolution: Schedule check-in; look for improvement and reinforce it

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: Developmental feedback on presentation skills
    context: Direct report gave a presentation that didn't go well; want to help them improve
    inputs:
      feedback_type: "developmental"
      recipient: "Direct report, 1 year on team, generally strong performer"
      specific_observations:
        - "In the executive presentation, spoke very quickly when Q&A started"
        - "Didn't make eye contact with the CFO when answering her question"
        - "Said 'I don't know' to two questions without offering to follow up"
      desired_outcome: "More confident, effective presence in executive presentations"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Assessment:
      - Type: Developmental (skill building, not corrective)
      - Urgency: Moderate (want to address before next big presentation)
      - Relationship: Good trust, generally open to feedback
      - Candor check: I care about their growth, this is to help them

      Step 2 - SBI Preparation:
      SBI 1: "In yesterday's exec presentation (S), when the CFO asked about
      the budget assumptions, you spoke quickly and didn't make eye contact (B).
      It may have come across as less confident, and she followed up with more
      questions than usual (I)."

      SBI 2: "When you were asked about timeline risks and said 'I don't know' (B),
      without offering to follow up, it left the question hanging and the execs
      may have less confidence in our planning (I)."

      Step 3 - Conversation Plan:
      Opening: "I wanted to debrief the exec presentation. You had some strong
      points, and I also noticed some things that might help you be even more
      effective. Can we talk about it?"

      Step 5 - Development:
      - "What would you do differently?"
      - Suggest: Prepare for likely tough questions; practice saying "Great
        question - I'll look into that and follow up by EOD"
      - Practice: Do a mock Q&A before next exec presentation
    expected_output:
      sbi_feedback:
        situation: "In yesterday's executive presentation during Q&A"
        behaviors:
          - "Speaking quickly when questioned"
          - "Not making eye contact with CFO"
          - "Saying 'I don't know' without follow-up commitment"
        impacts:
          - "May have appeared less confident"
          - "CFO asked more follow-up questions than usual"
          - "Left uncertainty about our preparedness"
      conversation_plan:
        opening: "I wanted to debrief the presentation - you did some things well and I noticed some opportunities to be even more effective"
        tone: "Developmental, supportive, forward-looking"
        key_message: "Executive presence in Q&A is a skill you can build"
      development_plan:
        actions:
          - "Prepare list of likely tough questions before exec presentations"
          - "Practice 'I'll follow up' responses instead of 'I don't know'"
          - "Practice with me doing mock Q&A before next presentation"
        follow_up: "Mock Q&A session before next exec meeting"

    process: |
      Step 1 - Assessment:
      - Type: Corrective (need behavior change)
      - Urgency: High (pattern continuing, affecting team)
      - Pattern: Yes, and previous feedback didn't stick
      - Need to be more direct this time

      Step 2 - SBI Preparation:
      "We talked about this three weeks ago, but I'm still seeing the same pattern.
      In the last five team meetings (S), you've been late to four of them,
      ranging from 5 to 15 minutes (B). Yesterday we waited 10 minutes and then
      had to rush through the agenda, which meant we didn't finish the planning
      discussion (I). The team is frustrated, and honestly, so am I."

      Step 3 - Conversation:
      - Be more direct: "This needs to change"
      - Ask what's going on: "Help me understand - is there something blocking you?"
      - Set clear expectation: "Going forward, I need you in meetings on time"
      - Discuss consequences if it continues
    expected_output:
      sbi_feedback:
        context: "This is a follow-up to our conversation 3 weeks ago"
        situation: "The last 5 team meetings"
        behavior: "Late to 4 of them (5-15 minutes each)"
        impact: "Team waits and rushes; frustration building; we missed the planning discussion yesterday"
      conversation_plan:
        opening: "I need to talk about meeting punctuality again. I'm concerned that our last conversation didn't lead to change."
        tone: "Direct, serious, but still caring"
        key_message: "This needs to change; what's getting in the way?"
        if_excuse: "I hear that, and I still need you on time. What will you do differently?"
      agreements:
        expectation: "On time to all team meetings starting now"
        their_action: "[Whatever they commit to]"
        consequence: "If continues, will need to involve their manager"
        follow_up: "Check in after next 3 meetings"
