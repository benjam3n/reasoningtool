description: Systematic procedure for writing persuasive content that influences readers and motivates action

long_description: |
  The Persuasive Writing procedure provides a comprehensive framework for creating
  written content that convinces readers and drives them to take specific actions.
  Applicable across formats including emails, proposals, pitches, op-eds, and
  advocacy materials.

  This procedure combines:
  - Audience analysis (understanding who you're persuading)
  - Psychological principles (reciprocity, social proof, scarcity, etc.)
  - Structural frameworks (AIDA, problem-solution, story-based)
  - Writing craft techniques (hooks, evidence, calls to action)
  - Revision practices (for both persuasion and clarity)

  Key principles:
  - Know your audience deeply before writing
  - Lead with value, not with your ask
  - Make the benefit to THEM crystal clear
  - Address objections proactively
  - Make it easy to say yes

  - Writing recommendation letters or endorsements

when_not_to_use:
  - For purely informational or technical documentation
  - When the audience has already decided and just needs details
  - For legal documents requiring precise neutral language
  - When manipulation would be unethical (misleading claims)

# ============================================
# PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
# ============================================
psychological_principles:
  reciprocity:
    principle: "People return favors and feel obligated after receiving"
    application: "Give value before asking - free resource, helpful insight, genuine compliment"
    example: "I noticed your recent post about X - here's a resource that might help. Also, I wanted to ask..."

  commitment_consistency:
    principle: "People act consistently with prior commitments and self-image"
    application: "Reference their past statements or values, get small agreements first"
    example: "You've said innovation is a priority. This proposal directly supports that goal."

  social_proof:
    principle: "People follow what others like them are doing"
    application: "Show others (especially similar others) taking the desired action"
    example: "Join 10,000 other engineering leaders who subscribe to..."

  authority:
    principle: "People defer to credible experts and institutions"
    application: "Cite experts, establish credentials, reference respected sources"
    example: "According to McKinsey research... Based on my 15 years in the field..."

  liking:
    principle: "People say yes to those they like and relate to"
    application: "Build rapport, find common ground, be genuinely helpful"
    example: "Like you, I've struggled with... As a fellow founder..."

  scarcity:
    principle: "People want what's rare or diminishing"
    application: "Highlight limited availability, deadlines, exclusive access"
    example: "Only 3 spots remaining... This offer expires Friday..."

  loss_aversion:
    principle: "Losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains"
    application: "Frame as avoiding loss rather than achieving gain"
    example: '"Don''t miss out on..." vs "Get access to..."'

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - Hook would make a busy person keep reading (test: would YOU read on?)
  - Benefit to reader is clear within first paragraph
  - Evidence is specific, credible, and well-placed
  - All likely objections are addressed before they arise
  - Call to action is specific, simple, and prominent
  - Urgency or reason to act NOW is present
  - Language is clear enough for a smart 12-year-old
  - Format is appropriate for the medium and audience

failure_modes:
  - mode: Self-focused writing
    symptom: Uses "I/we" more than "you", focuses on what writer wants
    resolution: Rewrite from audience perspective, lead with their benefit

  - mode: Buried lead
    symptom: Key point or ask appears late in the piece, readers lose interest
    resolution: Front-load value and main point, don't build up to it

  - mode: Vague call to action
    symptom: CTA is unclear ("let me know what you think") or missing
    resolution: Make CTA specific and actionable ("Reply YES and I'll send the contract")

  - mode: Objection avoidance
    symptom: Obvious concerns not addressed, reader raises them mentally
    resolution: List likely objections, address each proactively in the piece

  - mode: Evidence-free claims
    symptom: Assertions without support ("this is the best solution")
    resolution: Back every significant claim with data, example, or expert

  - mode: Jargon overload
    symptom: Technical language or buzzwords that alienate or confuse
    resolution: Use plain language, explain necessary terms, test with outsider

  - mode: Wall of text
    symptom: Long paragraphs, no visual breaks, hard to scan
    resolution: Short paragraphs, bullet points, headers, white space

        Hi [Name],

        Saw your talk at [Conference] on reducing cycle time - great insights on the CI bottleneck problem.

        We helped [Similar Company] cut deploy time 40% by addressing exactly that issue. Given [Company]'s growth, thought it might be relevant.

        Worth a 20-minute call to see if there's a fit?

        Here's my calendar: [link]

        Either way, congrats on the Series B.

        # Proposal: Modernizing Our Testing Infrastructure

        ## Executive Summary
        Our testing infrastructure is costing us approximately $50k annually in developer time and contributed to 3 production incidents last quarter. I'm proposing we adopt [New Framework] at $15k/year, with a 2-week pilot to validate. Expected ROI: 3x in year one, plus faster releases and fewer bugs.

        **Ask**: Approve $15k budget and 2-week pilot starting in Q2.

        ## The Problem
        Our current testing setup is hurting velocity and quality:
        - **Test suite runtime**: 45 minutes (developers context-switch while waiting)
        - **Production bugs**: 3 incidents in Q4 traced to test coverage gaps
        - **Team morale**: 70% of engineers cite testing as a top frustration (survey attached)
        - **Hidden cost**: ~$50k/year in developer time waiting for tests

        ## Proposed Solution
        Adopt [New Framework], which offers:
        - Parallel test execution (estimated 12 min vs 45 min)
        - Better coverage reporting (catch gaps before production)
        - Modern syntax our team already knows

        ## Expected Benefits
        - **Time savings**: 33 min/run x 20 runs/day = 11 hours saved daily
        - **Fewer bugs**: [Competitor] saw 60% reduction in regression bugs
        - **Team satisfaction**: Faster feedback loop, less waiting

        ## Implementation Plan
        Low-risk approach:
        1. **Week 1-2**: Pilot with Platform team (lowest risk, highest gain)
        2. **Week 3**: Evaluate results, gather feedback
        3. **Week 4-6**: If successful, gradual rollout to other teams
        4. **Rollback**: Keep current system until new one proven

        ## Investment
        - **Cost**: $15k/year (licensing) + 2 weeks pilot time
        - **Return**: $50k+ saved annually, fewer incidents, happier team
        - **ROI**: ~3x in year one

        ## Request
        Please approve:
        1. $15k budget for [New Framework] license
        2. Platform team pilot for 2 weeks starting [Date]
