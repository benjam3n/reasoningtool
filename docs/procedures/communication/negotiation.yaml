description: Systematic procedure for preparing and conducting negotiations to reach mutually beneficial agreements

long_description: |
  The Negotiation procedure provides a comprehensive framework for preparing,
  conducting, and closing negotiations across various scenarios including
  salary discussions, contract terms, business deals, and dispute resolution.

  Based on principled negotiation (Getting to Yes) combined with practical
  tactics, this procedure emphasizes:
  - Understanding underlying interests (not just positions)
  - Developing strong alternatives (BATNA)
  - Creating value before claiming it
  - Using objective criteria for fairness
  - Building relationships while achieving outcomes

  Key concepts:
  - BATNA: Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement
  - ZOPA: Zone of Possible Agreement
  - Reservation Point: Your walkaway threshold
  - Aspiration Point: Your best realistic outcome

# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:
  - Negotiating salary, compensation, or benefits with an employer
  - Reaching agreement on contract terms with clients or vendors
  - Resolving disputes where parties have conflicting interests
  - Making business deals involving price, scope, or timeline
  - Negotiating partnership terms or joint venture agreements
  - Handling difficult conversations where interests conflict

when_not_to_use:
  - When there is no real conflict of interest (just miscommunication)
  - For routine transactions with fixed, non-negotiable prices
  - When the relationship is more important than any possible outcome
  - For ethical or legal matters where compromise is inappropriate
  - When you have zero leverage and no alternatives whatsoever
  - For trivial matters where negotiation effort exceeds potential gain
  - When the other party is acting in bad faith with no intent to agree
  - For emergency situations requiring immediate action
  - When cultural norms make negotiation inappropriate or offensive

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - BATNA is honestly assessed (not inflated or ignored)
  - Interests are distinguished from positions (asking "why" behind wants)
  - Reservation point is set before negotiation (not moved during)
  - Objective criteria identified and used (not just power-based)
  - Concessions are conditional (traded, not given away)
  - Agreement is documented in writing
  - Both parties' interests are addressed (not just yours)

failure_modes:
  - mode: Inadequate preparation
    symptom: Making concessions without knowing your limits, surprised by their arguments
    resolution: Complete full preparation worksheet before any negotiation conversation

  - mode: Positional bargaining
    symptom: Stuck arguing positions ("I want X" / "I want Y") without progress
    resolution: Ask "why" to uncover underlying interests, look for creative solutions

  - mode: Overestimating your BATNA
    symptom: Walking away from deals better than your actual alternative
    resolution: Honestly evaluate BATNA before negotiation, test it if possible

  - mode: Emotional hijacking
    symptom: Making decisions based on anger, fear, or pride rather than interests
    resolution: Take breaks when emotional, separate people from problem

  - mode: Winner's curse
    symptom: They accepted your first offer immediately (you could have done better)
    resolution: Always start with ambitious but justifiable opening, anchor appropriately

  - mode: Leaving value on the table
    symptom: Single-issue focus when multiple issues could create trades
    resolution: Expand issues, look for different valuations to enable logrolling

  - mode: Agreement without documentation
    symptom: Different understandings of what was agreed emerge later
    resolution: Always document agreements in writing, confirm mutual understanding

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: Salary negotiation for new job offer
    context: Received job offer at $95,000, believe market rate is higher based on research
    inputs:
      negotiation_context: "Salary negotiation for Senior Developer position"
      your_interests:
        - "Compensation reflecting market value"
        - "Career growth opportunity"
        - "Work-life balance"
        - "Interesting technical challenges"
      their_likely_interests:
        - "Fill critical role quickly"
        - "Stay within budget"
        - "Hire someone who will stay"
        - "Get strong technical skills"
      your_batna: "Current job at $88,000 with good work-life balance"
      constraints:
        - "Need decision within 1 week"
        - "Must be at least $95,000 to consider move"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Research:
      - Market data shows Senior Developer: $100-120k in this market
      - Company recently raised funding, likely has budget
      - Glassdoor shows similar roles at company: $105-115k
      - Hiring manager mentioned urgency to fill role

      Step 2 - Define position:
      - Interests: Fair pay, growth, interesting work, flexibility
      - BATNA: Stay at current job ($88k, but comfortable)
      - Reservation: $98k (enough to justify switching costs)
      - Aspiration: $115k + signing bonus
      - Opening: $118k (justified by market data + my experience)

      Step 3 - Analyze counterpart:
      - Their interest: Fill role quickly with strong candidate
      - Their BATNA: Continue searching (costly delay)
      - Their constraint: Likely salary band, need approval for exceptions
      - Shared interest: Long-term fit, not just filling seat

      Step 4 - Strategy:
      - They made first offer, so I counter with justified higher number
      - Emphasize total compensation (base, bonus, equity, benefits)
      - Prepare to trade on non-salary items if base is capped
      - Questions: "What's the typical career path?" "How are raises determined?"

      Step 5 - Negotiation:
      - "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about this opportunity."
      - "Based on my research and experience, I was expecting something closer to $115-118k."
      - "I've seen market data showing this range for similar roles, and I bring X, Y, Z experience."
      - Listen to their response, ask about total compensation
      - If base capped: "If the base is constrained, could we discuss a signing bonus or accelerated review?"

      Step 6 - Close:
      - Agreed: $108k base + $5k signing bonus + early review at 6 months
      - Documented in revised offer letter
      - Start date confirmed
    expected_output:
      negotiated_agreement:
        base_salary: "$108,000"
        signing_bonus: "$5,000"
        review_timeline: "6 months instead of 12"
        total_first_year: "$113,000"
      outcome_vs_targets:
        vs_aspiration: "93% of target achieved"
        vs_reservation: "Well above reservation point"
      key_learnings:
        - "Non-salary items provided flexibility when base was constrained"
        - "Market data was persuasive to hiring manager"

  - name: Vendor contract renewal with price increase
    context: Key software vendor requesting 25% price increase at renewal
    inputs:
      negotiation_context: "Annual SaaS contract renewal, vendor requesting price increase"
      your_interests:
        - "Control costs within budget"
        - "Maintain service continuity"
        - "Get value for spend"
        - "Avoid painful migration"
      their_likely_interests:
        - "Increase revenue per customer"
        - "Retain customer"
        - "Lock in multi-year deal"
        - "Maintain good reference"
      your_batna: "Competitor product (6-month migration, $20k switching cost)"
      constraints:
        - "Budget allows max 10% increase"
        - "Contract expires in 30 days"
        - "200 users dependent on system"
      relationship_importance: "ongoing"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Research:
      - Competitor pricing gathered: 15% less than current vendor
      - Industry standard increase: 3-5% annually
      - Vendor's churn rate is high, they value retention
      - Our usage has grown 40%, we're now larger customer

      Step 2 - Define position:
      - Interests: Cost control, continuity, value
      - BATNA: Migrate to competitor (painful but doable)
      - Reservation: 10% increase maximum
      - Aspiration: 5% increase with added features
      - Opening: Request 0% increase given our growth

      Step 3 - Analyze counterpart:
      - Their interest: Revenue, but also retention
      - Their BATNA: Find new customer (expensive)
      - Their constraint: Sales quota, pricing guidelines
      - Shared interest: Long-term partnership, reference value

      Step 4 - Strategy:
      - Don't accept first ask, counter with data
      - Offer multi-year in exchange for price lock
      - Request additional features/support to justify any increase
      - Mention competitor evaluation (credible alternative)

      Step 5 - Negotiation:
      - "We've been happy with the product, but 25% increase is above market."
      - "Industry standard is 3-5%, and we've actually evaluated alternatives."
      - "Given our growth, we'd expect to be treated as a valued customer."
      - "What can you do to keep this partnership strong?"
      - If they hold: "We could consider a 2-year commitment if that helps justify better pricing."

      Step 6 - Close:
      - Agreed: 8% increase Year 1, 5% Year 2, premium support included
      - 2-year agreement with 30-day notice termination clause
      - Documented in contract amendment
    expected_output:
      negotiated_agreement:
        year_1_increase: "8% (vs 25% requested)"
        year_2_increase: "5%"
        term: "2 years"
        added_value: "Premium support tier included"
        protection: "30-day termination clause"
      outcome_vs_targets:
        vs_aspiration: "Close to target with added support value"
        vs_reservation: "Within 10% budget constraint"
        value_created: "Multi-year for price stability trade benefited both"
      key_learnings:
        - "Credible BATNA (competitor evaluation) created leverage"
        - "Multi-year commitment was valuable currency for them"
        - "Asking 'what can you do' invited creative solutions"
