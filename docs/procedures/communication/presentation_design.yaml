description: Systematic procedure for designing visually effective presentations, slides, and handouts that enhance rather than compete with your message

long_description: |
  The Presentation Design procedure provides a framework for creating visual
  materials that support effective communication. Good presentation design
  makes complex ideas clear, focuses attention appropriately, and enhances
  rather than replaces the presenter.

  This procedure covers:
  - Slide design principles (simplicity, visual hierarchy, consistency)
  - Visual hierarchy (guiding the eye to what matters)
  - Data visualization (making numbers meaningful)
  - Handout design (materials that work without you)
  - Technical execution (tools, templates, delivery formats)

  Key principles:
  - You are the presentation; slides support you
  - One idea per slide maximum
  - Visuals over text, always
  - Design for the back of the room
  - If the slide can stand alone, you're not needed

tags:
  - communication
  - presentation
  - design
  - visualization
  - slides
  - data

# ============================================
# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:
  - Creating slides for any presentation or talk
  - Designing pitch decks for investors or clients
  - Building executive briefing materials
  - Preparing conference or meetup presentations
  - Creating training materials with visual aids
  - Designing data-heavy presentations that need clarity
  - Building leave-behind documents or handouts
  - Creating video presentation visuals

when_not_to_use:
  - When no visual aids are appropriate (some talks are better without slides)
  - For documents meant to be read, not presented (use document design instead)
  - When time doesn't permit quality design (simple or none is better than bad)
  - For informal discussions where slides would be overkill

# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Define design requirements
    action: |
      Before designing, understand what the visuals need to accomplish:

      Audience analysis:
      1. What is their visual literacy level?
      2. What design conventions do they expect?
      3. Will they see this once (presentation) or refer back (handout)?
      4. Are there accessibility considerations?

      Context analysis:
      1. Room size and screen configuration?
      2. Lighting conditions?
      3. Virtual vs in-person?
      4. Will people be close or far from screen?

      Content requirements:
      1. How many main sections?
      2. What types of content (concepts, data, processes, comparisons)?
      3. Are there complex ideas that need visual explanation?
      4. Is there data that needs visualization?

      Constraints:
      1. Brand guidelines or templates required?
      2. Format requirements (aspect ratio, file type)?
      3. Accessibility requirements?
      4. Time available for design?
    inputs:
      - audience
      - presentation_context (optional)
      - brand_constraints (optional)
      - technical_constraints (optional)
    outputs:
      - design_requirements: what the visuals need to accomplish
      - context_constraints: environmental factors affecting design
      - content_types: types of content that need visual treatment
    verification: |
      Know the viewing context (room size, virtual/in-person)
      Identified types of content requiring visual design

  - id: 2
    name: Plan the visual structure
    action: |
      Map content to visual treatment:

      Content-to-visual mapping:
      1. Title slides: For section breaks and major transitions
      2. Concept slides: Single ideas that need illustration
      3. Data slides: Numbers that need visualization
      4. Process slides: Sequences or workflows
      5. Comparison slides: Contrasting options or before/after
      6. Image slides: Full-bleed images for emotional impact
      7. Blank slides: Strategic pauses where you want attention on you

      Slide count estimation:
      - 1-2 slides per minute of talking (maximum)
      - Better to have fewer, more impactful slides
      - Account for transition slides and pauses

      Visual narrative:
      - How does the visual journey support the story?
      - Where are the high-impact moments?
      - What visual motifs or metaphors could unify the deck?
    inputs:
      - presentation_content
      - time_available (optional)
      - content_types (from Step 1)
    outputs:
      - slide_plan: list of slides with type and purpose
      - visual_narrative: how visuals support the story arc
      - slide_count: estimated total slides
    verification: |
      Slide count is appropriate for time (1-2 per minute max)
      Each slide has a clear purpose identified

  - id: 3
    name: Establish visual design system
    action: |
      Create consistent design elements:

      Color palette:
      - Primary color (1): For emphasis and key elements
      - Secondary color (1-2): For supporting elements
      - Neutral colors: For text and backgrounds
      - Accent color (1): For calls to action or highlights
      - Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
      - Consider color blindness (don't rely on red/green alone)

      Typography:
      - Headline font: Bold, readable from distance
      - Body font: Clean, professional, readable
      - Maximum 2 font families
      - Minimum sizes: Headlines 32pt+, body 24pt+
      - Consistent hierarchy across slides

      Layout grid:
      - Consistent margins (generous - use whitespace)
      - Alignment guides for elements
      - Consistent placement of recurring elements (logo, page numbers)

      Visual elements:
      - Icon style (line, filled, consistent style)
      - Image treatment (full bleed, contained, filtered)
      - Chart style (colors, labels, legends)
      - Transition style (simple, consistent)
    inputs:
      - brand_constraints (optional)
      - context_constraints (from Step 1)
    outputs:
      - color_palette: defined colors with usage guidelines
      - typography_system: fonts and sizes for each use
      - layout_grid: template layout with guides
      - visual_elements: icon, image, and chart standards
    verification: |
      Color palette has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
      Font sizes are readable from back of room
      Design system is simple enough to apply consistently

  - id: 4
    name: Design slide layouts
    action: |
      Create or select slide templates for each content type:

      Title slide:
      - Presentation title (large, prominent)
      - Subtitle or tagline
      - Presenter name and context
      - Minimal, impactful visual

      Section break slide:
      - Section title only
      - Strong visual impact
      - Signals transition to audience

      Concept slide (most common):
      - One idea, one visual
      - Text: 6 words or fewer
      - Large image or simple diagram
      - Whitespace to let idea breathe

      Data slide:
      - One chart or visualization per slide
      - Clear headline stating the insight (not "Q3 Sales" but "Sales grew 40%")
      - Minimal labels, no chartjunk
      - Call out the key data point visually

      Comparison slide:
      - Clear two-column or before/after structure
      - Parallel construction
      - Visual distinction between options

      Quote slide:
      - Quote in large text
      - Attribution smaller
      - Simple, minimal design

      Image slide:
      - Full-bleed high-quality image
      - Minimal or no text overlay
      - Use for emotional impact or transitions
    inputs:
      - slide_plan (from Step 2)
      - typography_system (from Step 3)
      - layout_grid (from Step 3)
    outputs:
      - slide_templates: reusable layouts for each content type
      - usage_guidelines: when to use each template
    verification: |
      Have templates for all content types identified in planning
      Templates enforce design constraints (minimal text, etc.)

  - id: 5
    name: Design data visualizations
    action: |
      Create clear, honest, impactful data displays:

      Choose the right chart:
      - Comparison: Bar chart (horizontal for many items)
      - Change over time: Line chart
      - Part of whole: Pie (limit to 3-5 slices) or stacked bar
      - Relationship: Scatter plot
      - Distribution: Histogram

      Data visualization principles:
      1. Start axis at zero (unless misleading not to)
      2. Label directly, avoid legends when possible
      3. Remove chartjunk (gridlines, 3D effects, unnecessary decoration)
      4. Highlight the insight, not just the data
      5. Use color strategically to draw attention
      6. Make the headline the insight ("Sales grew 40%" not "Q3 Sales")

      Avoid:
      - 3D charts (distort perception)
      - Dual Y-axes (confusing)
      - Too many data series (simplify)
      - Truncated axes that exaggerate differences
      - Pie charts with too many slices

      Accessibility:
      - Don't rely on color alone (use patterns or labels)
      - Ensure sufficient contrast
      - Provide alt text descriptions
    inputs:
      - presentation_content (data elements)
      - color_palette (from Step 3)
    outputs:
      - data_visualizations: designed charts and graphs
      - visualization_guidelines: how data was treated
    verification: |
      Charts show insight clearly, not just data
      No chartjunk or misleading visual treatments
      Data is labeled directly, legends minimized

  - id: 6
    name: Build the slides
    action: |
      Execute the design for each slide:

      Building process:
      1. Start with template/layout for slide type
      2. Add content following design system
      3. Apply one-idea-per-slide rule ruthlessly
      4. Replace text with visuals wherever possible
      5. Check readability at actual viewing size
      6. Ensure consistency with design system

      Slide-by-slide checklist:
      - Is there only ONE idea on this slide?
      - Could this be an image instead of text?
      - Is text under 6 words?
      - Is it readable from the back of the room?
      - Does it follow the design system?
      - Does the headline state an insight/claim (not just a topic)?

      Text reduction techniques:
      - Bullet points to single headline
      - Paragraphs to key phrase
      - Lists to icons with labels
      - Tables to simplified charts
      - Text to visual metaphor

      Animation guidelines:
      - Use sparingly and purposefully
      - Simple transitions only (no spinning text)
      - Build sequences can reveal complexity gradually
      - Avoid animation that competes with your words
    inputs:
      - slide_plan (from Step 2)
      - slide_templates (from Step 4)
      - data_visualizations (from Step 5)
      - visual_elements (from Step 3)
    outputs:
      - slide_deck: completed presentation slides
      - speaker_notes: aligned notes for each slide
    verification: |
      Every slide passes the 6-word test (or less)
      Design system is applied consistently throughout
      Could present without slides if they failed

  - id: 7
    name: Create supporting materials
    action: |
      Design handouts or leave-behind documents:

      Handout purposes:
      - Reference during presentation (brief, follow-along)
      - Reference after presentation (detailed, standalone)
      - Pre-reading before presentation (context setting)

      Handout design principles:
      - Handouts are DOCUMENTS, not printed slides
      - Include detail that slides deliberately exclude
      - Can stand alone without presenter
      - Include sources, references, next steps
      - Design for reading, not projecting

      What to include:
      - Summary of key points
      - Detailed data and analysis
      - References and sources
      - Contact information and next steps
      - Space for notes if used during presentation

      When to distribute:
      - Before: If they need context or will take notes
      - After: If you want attention on you during talk
      - During: Only if they need to reference specific content
    inputs:
      - presentation_content
      - slide_deck (from Step 6)
    outputs:
      - handout: leave-behind document
      - distribution_plan: when and how to provide materials
    verification: |
      Handout can stand alone without presenter
      Handout is a document, not printed slides

  - id: 8
    name: Review and refine
    action: |
      Quality check the complete design:

      Visual review:
      1. View at actual presentation size
      2. Step back - is it readable from distance?
      3. Squint test - do key elements stand out?
      4. Consistency check - does design system hold throughout?
      5. Flow check - does visual narrative work?

      Content review:
      1. One idea per slide?
      2. Text minimal enough?
      3. Headlines state insights, not just topics?
      4. Data visualizations clear and honest?
      5. Could you present without slides?

      Technical review:
      1. File size acceptable?
      2. Fonts embedded?
      3. Links working?
      4. Compatible with presentation system?
      5. Backup formats available?

      Accessibility review:
      1. Color contrast sufficient?
      2. Not relying on color alone?
      3. Alt text for images?
      4. Readable fonts and sizes?
    inputs:
      - slide_deck (from Step 6)
      - handout (from Step 7)
    outputs:
      - refined_slide_deck: polished final version
      - design_documentation: rationale and guidelines for future
      - backup_files: exported versions in backup formats
    verification: |
      Slides pass distance readability test
      All technical requirements met
      Accessibility standards met

# ============================================
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# ============================================
design_principles:
  simplicity:
    principle: "Reduce until it breaks, then add back one thing"
    application:
      - "Start with nothing, add only what's essential"
      - "Remove every element that doesn't serve the message"
      - "White space is not wasted space"
      - "If in doubt, leave it out"

  one_idea_per_slide:
    principle: "Each slide should have one and only one purpose"
    application:
      - "If you can split it, split it"
      - "Builds/reveals can show sequence on one slide"
      - "The slide should pass the 'what is this about?' instant test"
      - "Agenda slides can list items, but each item is one phrase"

  visual_hierarchy:
    principle: "Guide the eye to what matters most"
    application:
      - "Larger = more important"
      - "Color draws attention - use strategically"
      - "Position matters - top left is read first"
      - "Contrast creates hierarchy - make key elements pop"

  consistency:
    principle: "Consistent design builds trust and reduces cognitive load"
    application:
      - "Same fonts, colors, layouts throughout"
      - "Same placement for recurring elements"
      - "Variations should be meaningful, not random"
      - "Templates enforce consistency"

  readability:
    principle: "Design for the worst seat in the room"
    application:
      - "If it's too small for the back row, it's too small"
      - "High contrast between text and background"
      - "Simple, clean fonts - no decorative scripts"
      - "Test at actual viewing size"

  support_not_replace:
    principle: "Slides support the speaker, they don't replace them"
    application:
      - "If slides can stand alone, you're not needed"
      - "Audience should look at you, not read your slides"
      - "Slides illustrate; you explain"
      - "Never read your slides"

# ============================================
# VISUAL HIERARCHY
# ============================================
visual_hierarchy:
  guiding_attention:
    size:
      principle: "Larger elements are seen first and perceived as more important"
      application: "Make headlines larger than supporting text; key data points larger than labels"

    color:
      principle: "Color contrast draws the eye"
      application: "Use accent color only for most important elements; grayscale for context"

    position:
      principle: "Top-left is seen first in most cultures; center commands attention"
      application: "Put most important element in prime position; use center for single focus"

    contrast:
      principle: "High contrast elements pop; low contrast recedes"
      application: "Full saturation for key elements; desaturated for supporting content"

    whitespace:
      principle: "Isolation draws attention; crowding diffuses it"
      application: "Give key elements breathing room; group related elements together"

  common_patterns:
    z_pattern:
      description: "Eye moves top-left to top-right, diagonal to bottom-left, then bottom-right"
      use: "Place key elements along this path"

    f_pattern:
      description: "For text-heavy content, eye scans horizontal lines, dropping down"
      use: "Put most important info in first lines"

    center_focus:
      description: "Single centered element commands full attention"
      use: "For hero images or single key messages"

    thirds:
      description: "Divide slide into 3x3 grid, place key elements at intersections"
      use: "For balanced, visually pleasing layouts"

# DATA VISUALIZATION
# ============================================
data_visualization:
  chart_selection:
    bar_chart:
      use_for: "Comparing discrete items"
      variants:
        - "Horizontal: when labels are long or many items"
        - "Vertical: when fewer items or showing change over time"
        - "Stacked: showing part of whole across categories"

    line_chart:
      use_for: "Showing change over time, trends"
      guidelines:
        - "Time on x-axis"
        - "Limit to 3-4 lines maximum"
        - "Use direct labels, not legend if possible"

    pie_chart:
      use_for: "Showing part of whole (use sparingly)"
      guidelines:
        - "Maximum 5 slices"
        - "Start at 12 o'clock, largest slice first"
        - "Consider donut or bar chart instead"

    scatter_plot:
      use_for: "Showing relationship between two variables"
      guidelines:
        - "Clear axis labels"
        - "Use trend line if relationship is the point"
        - "Color or size can show third variable"

  design_guidelines:
    clarity:
      - "Title is the insight, not the description ('Sales grew 40%' not 'Q3 Sales')"
      - "Label data directly, minimize legends"
      - "Remove gridlines or make them subtle"
      - "Highlight the key data point"

    honesty:
      - "Start y-axis at zero (unless zero is misleading)"
      - "Consistent scales across related charts"
      - "Don't cherry-pick time ranges to distort trends"
      - "Show context when needed"

    simplicity:
      - "One insight per chart"
      - "Remove chartjunk (3D effects, decorations)"
      - "Limit colors to what's meaningful"
      - "If complex, build with animation"

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - Every slide has one clear idea only
  - Text is 6 words or fewer (except quotes)
  - Readable from the back of the room (32pt+ headlines, 24pt+ body)
  - Design system applied consistently throughout
  - Data visualizations show insight, not just data
  - Presentation can be delivered without slides if needed
  - Accessibility requirements met (contrast, alt text)
  - Technical requirements met (format, size, compatibility)

failure_modes:
  - mode: Slideument
    symptom: Slides full of text that could be a document
    resolution: Reduce text to 6 words max; put detail in handout or speaker notes

  - mode: Death by bullet
    symptom: Every slide is bullet points
    resolution: Replace bullets with visuals, diagrams, or single powerful statements

  - mode: Reading the slides
    symptom: Presenter reads what audience can see
    resolution: Slides should illustrate, not duplicate what you're saying

  - mode: Chartjunk
    symptom: Busy, decorated charts that obscure the data
    resolution: Remove 3D effects, unnecessary gridlines, decoration; highlight key insight

  - mode: Inconsistency
    symptom: Random fonts, colors, layouts throughout
    resolution: Establish and enforce design system from the start

  - mode: Too many slides
    symptom: Rushing through 60 slides in 20 minutes
    resolution: 1-2 slides per minute max; cut ruthlessly

  - mode: Unreadable from distance
    symptom: Squinting audience, small text, low contrast
    resolution: Test at actual viewing size; minimum 24pt; high contrast

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: Investor pitch deck
    context: 10-minute pitch to venture capitalists
    inputs:
      presentation_content: "Pitch narrative with problem, solution, market, team, ask"
      audience: "VCs, see hundreds of pitches, sophisticated but time-poor"
      presentation_context: "in_person_small"
      time_available: 10

    process: |
      Step 1 - Requirements:
      - Audience: Visual savvy, will judge professionalism; want to see key metrics quickly
      - Context: Conference room, close viewing, 2-3 people
      - Content: Story-driven with key metrics; need memorable differentiation

      Step 2 - Structure (10 slides for 10 minutes):
      1. Hook slide (not company name - start with problem or vision)
      2. Problem slide (their pain)
      3. Solution slide (your answer)
      4. Demo/How it works (if applicable)
      5. Traction slide (key metrics)
      6. Market slide (opportunity size)
      7. Business model (how you make money)
      8. Team slide
      9. Ask slide (what you want)
      10. Contact/close

      Step 3 - Design system:
      - Clean, professional, not flashy
      - Brand colors with high-contrast text
      - Modern sans-serif fonts
      - Minimal decoration
      - Metrics displayed prominently

      time_available: 30
      technical_constraints: "16:9 format, large screen, 500-person room"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Requirements:
      - Audience: Technical, want depth, will reference slides later
      - Context: Large room, back row 50+ feet from screen
      - Content: Concepts, architecture diagrams, code samples

      Step 2 - Structure:
      - Title slide
      - Problem context (2-3 slides)
      - Solution overview (1 slide)
      - Deep dive into 3 key concepts (3-4 slides each)
      - Demo/code examples (2-3 slides)
      - Summary and takeaways
      - Resources

      Step 3 - Design system:
      - High contrast (will be in lit room)
      - Very large fonts (back of room readability)
      - Simple diagrams, build complexity with reveals
      - Code in large, readable font with highlighting

      Step 5 - Technical diagrams:
      - Architecture: Build up layer by layer
      - Flow: Animate the sequence
      - Code: Highlight relevant lines, not full files
    expected_output:
      slide_deck:
        slide_count: 20-25
        design_approach: "High contrast, large fonts, progressive reveals"
        key_decisions:
          - "Architecture diagram builds in 4 steps"
          - "Code snippets are 10 lines max, key parts highlighted"
          - "Each concept slide has diagram on left, 3 bullet points on right"
          - "Summary slide has 3 key takeaways only"
      handout:
        content: "Full code samples, references, links to repository"
        distribution: "QR code on final slide to download"
