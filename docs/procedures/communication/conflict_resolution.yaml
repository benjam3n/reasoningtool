description: Systematic procedure for de-escalating tensions, finding common ground, and navigating difficult conversations productively

long_description: |
  The Conflict Resolution procedure provides a framework for addressing disagreements,
  tensions, and difficult interpersonal situations in professional and personal contexts.
  Healthy conflict resolution transforms potentially destructive situations into
  opportunities for better understanding, stronger relationships, and improved outcomes.

  This procedure integrates:
  - De-escalation techniques (calming heated situations)
  - Interest-based problem solving (beyond positions to needs)
  - Difficult conversation frameworks (giving and receiving hard messages)
  - Mediation principles (when you're helping others resolve conflict)
  - Repair practices (rebuilding after conflict)

  Key principles:
  - Conflict is natural and can be productive if handled well
  - Focus on interests, not positions
  - Understanding precedes solving
  - Emotions are data, not obstacles
  - The relationship is usually more important than any single issue

# PROCEDURE
# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Assess the situation and your readiness
    action: |
      Before engaging, understand what you're dealing with:

      Situation assessment:
      1. What is the actual conflict about? (content, relationship, identity, process?)
      2. How escalated is it? (early tension vs active conflict vs heated)
      3. What's the history? (first incident vs pattern)
      4. Who else is affected?
      5. What happens if this isn't resolved?
      6. Is this the right time to address it?

      Self-assessment:
      1. Am I calm enough to have a productive conversation?
      2. What are MY interests and needs? (not positions)
      3. What might I be contributing to this situation?
      4. Am I approaching this to resolve or to win?
      5. What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?
      6. What outcome would be truly good for everyone?
    inputs:
      - conflict_situation
      - escalation_level (optional)
    outputs:
      - situation_assessment: understanding of the conflict type and state
      - readiness_check: your emotional and mental state for the conversation
      - timing_decision: whether now is the right time to engage
    verification: |
      Can describe the situation objectively, without loaded language
      Honestly assessed whether you're calm enough to proceed
      Identified at least one thing you might be contributing

  - id: 2
    name: Understand their perspective genuinely
    action: |
      Before solving anything, seek to understand their view:

      Perspective-taking:
      1. What do they likely see as the problem?
      2. What are their underlying interests and needs?
      3. What pressures or constraints might they be facing?
      4. How might they be feeling? (frustrated, threatened, unheard?)
      5. What might they think YOUR motives are?
      6. What's the most charitable interpretation of their behavior?

      Gathering information:
      - If you don't know, ask (not interrogate) to understand
      - Listen for emotions and values, not just facts
      - Look for the valid point in their position (there usually is one)

      Common underlying interests:
      - Respect and recognition
      - Autonomy and control
      - Fairness and equity
      - Safety and security
      - Being heard and understood
    inputs:
      - other_party
      - their_likely_perspective (optional)
    outputs:
      - their_perspective: best understanding of their view
      - their_interests: underlying needs driving their position
      - charitable_interpretation: most generous reading of their behavior
      - valid_point: what's legitimate in their concern
    verification: |
      Can state their position as they would state it
      Identified at least 2 underlying interests they likely have
      Found at least one valid point in their perspective

  - id: 3
    name: Find common ground and shared interests
    action: |
      Identify where your interests align:

      Shared interests to look for:
      - Both want the project/team/company to succeed
      - Both want to work in a healthy environment
      - Both want to be respected and heard
      - Both want to find a workable solution
      - Both have constraints they're working within

      Common ground mapping:
      1. List your key interests
      2. List their likely key interests
      3. Identify overlaps (shared interests)
      4. Identify complementary interests (different but not conflicting)
      5. Identify true conflicts (limited to fewer issues than you think)

      Reframing:
      - "Us vs the problem" not "me vs you"
      - "How do we solve this together?"
      - Frame the conversation around shared interests
    inputs:
      - your_perspective
      - their_perspective (from Step 2)
    outputs:
      - shared_interests: where you both want the same thing
      - complementary_interests: different but compatible interests
      - true_conflicts: actual incompatible interests (usually fewer than expected)
      - reframing: how to position this as a shared problem
    verification: |
      Identified at least 2 genuine shared interests
      True conflicts are limited to specific, concrete issues
      Have a "we" framing for the conversation

  - id: 4
    name: Plan the conversation
    action: |
      Prepare for the difficult conversation:

      Logistics:
      - Private setting, not public or in passing
      - Adequate time (don't rush important conversations)
      - Low-stakes timing (not right before a deadline or after a setback)
      - Request the conversation respectfully ("Can we talk about X?")

      Opening approach:
      - Start with genuine shared interest or appreciation
      - State your intention (to understand and resolve, not to blame)
      - Own your part if relevant
      - Describe impact without attributing motive

      Conversation structure:

      3. Invite their perspective (genuinely)
      4. Identify shared interests
      5. Generate options together
      6. Agree on path forward
      7. Commit to follow-up

      Phrases to use:
      - "I'd like to understand your perspective on..."
      - "When X happened, I felt... and I assumed... Was I reading that right?"
      - "What I'm hoping for is... What are you hoping for?"
      - "What would work for both of us?"
    inputs:
      - shared_interests (from Step 3)
      - reframing (from Step 3)
      - relationship_importance (optional)
    outputs:
      - conversation_plan: structured approach for the conversation
      - opening_statement: how you'll start the conversation
      - key_questions: questions to ask to understand their view
      - desired_outcomes: what a good resolution looks like

      Have specific questions to ask (not just points to make)
      Identified what a "good enough" resolution would look like

  - id: 5
    name: Have the conversation
    action: |
      Execute the conversation with skill and presence:

      During the conversation:
      1. Start with your planned opening (collaborative tone)
      2. Share your perspective using I-statements
         - "I felt X when Y happened" not "You made me feel X"
         - "I noticed X and assumed Y, is that accurate?"
      3. STOP and listen - genuinely seek to understand their response
      4. Acknowledge their perspective (doesn't mean agreeing)
         - "It sounds like you're feeling..."
         - "I can see why that would be frustrating"
      5. Look for the valid point and acknowledge it
      6. Share where you see common ground
      7. Brainstorm solutions together
      8. Agree on specific next steps

      If it gets heated:
      - Slow down, lower your voice
      - Acknowledge the emotion: "This is clearly important to both of us"
      - Take a break if needed: "Let's pause and come back to this"
      - Return to shared interests

      What to avoid:
      - Attacking character ("You always..." "You're being...")
      - Defending before understanding
      - Bringing up past issues not relevant to this conversation
      - Trying to "win" the conversation

      Acknowledged their perspective (even if disagreeing)
      Stayed focused on the issue at hand (no kitchen-sinking)

  - id: 6
    name: Reach resolution
    action: |
      Move from understanding to agreement:

      Finding resolution:
      1. Summarize shared understanding of the situation
      2. Review shared interests
      3. Generate multiple options (don't lock into first idea)
      4. Evaluate options against shared interests
      5. Choose path forward that addresses key interests of both parties
      6. Be specific about who does what by when

      Types of resolution:
      - Agreement: Both parties commit to specific actions
      - Understanding: No behavior change needed, just clarity
      - Compromise: Both give something to get something
      - Creative solution: New option that meets both parties' needs
      - Agree to disagree: Acknowledge difference, agree how to move forward

      Document the agreement:
      - What specifically are we each committing to?
      - What does success look like?
      - When will we check in on progress?
      - What will we do if the issue resurfaces?
    inputs:
      - solutions_discussed (from Step 5)
      - shared_interests (from Step 3)
    outputs:
      - resolution_outcome: the agreement reached
      - specific_commitments: who will do what by when
      - check_in_plan: when you'll follow up
      - escalation_plan: what to do if resolution doesn't hold
    verification: |

      After resolution, invest in the relationship:

      Immediate repair:
      - Thank them for the conversation
      - Acknowledge what was difficult
      - Reaffirm the relationship or working partnership
      - Follow through on your commitments immediately

      - Address small issues early (don't let them build up again)
      - Give credit and appreciation when things go well

      Systemic prevention:
      - What structural or process changes would prevent similar conflicts?

# ============================================
# DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES
# ============================================
de_escalation:
  in_the_moment:
    lower_the_temperature:
      - "Lower your voice (others will match)"
      - "Slow your pace of speech"
      - "Pause before responding"
      - "Soften your body language"
      - "Sit down if standing"

    acknowledge_emotions:
      - "'I can see this is frustrating.'"
      - "'This clearly matters a lot to you.'"
      - "'I understand why you'd feel that way.'"
      - "Name the emotion without judgment"

    avoid_escalation_triggers:
      - "Don't say 'calm down' (escalates)"
      - "Don't dismiss feelings ('it's not a big deal')"
      - "Don't defend immediately"
      - "Don't match their intensity"

    buy_time_if_needed:
      - "'I want to respond to this thoughtfully. Can we continue in an hour?'"
      - "'Let me make sure I understand. You're saying...'"
      - "'This is important. Let's find a time to discuss it properly.'"

  heated_conversations:
    if_they_raise_voice:
      - "Stay calm, speak quietly (contrast has impact)"
      - "Acknowledge: 'I can hear this is important to you'"
      - "Redirect: 'I want to understand. Help me see it from your perspective'"
      - "Set boundary if needed: 'I want to have this conversation, but not like this'"

    if_you_feel_triggered:
      - "Notice body signals (clenched jaw, racing heart)"
      - "Take a breath before responding"
      - "Name it to yourself: 'I'm getting defensive'"
      - "Ask for time if needed: 'I need a few minutes to think about this'"

    if_conversation_derails:
      - "Acknowledge the derail: 'We've gotten off track'"
      - "Refocus: 'Let's come back to what we're trying to solve'"
      - "If can't recover: 'Let's pause and come back to this when we're both ready'"

# ============================================
# DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TYPES
# ============================================
conversation_types:
  giving_critical_feedback:
    approach: |
      Use SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) format:
      - Situation: "In yesterday's meeting..."
      - Behavior: "When you interrupted several times..."
      - Impact: "It made others hesitant to share their ideas"
    key_principles:
      - "Describe behavior, not character"
      - "Be specific, not general"
      - "Focus on impact, not intent"
      - "Make it about the future, not punishment"

  receiving_feedback:
    approach: |
      - Listen fully without defending
      - Thank them for telling you
      - Ask clarifying questions
      - Reflect on validity before responding
      - Commit to what you'll do differently
    key_principles:
      - "Assume it's at least partially valid"
      - "Separate impact from intent"
      - "They're telling you something useful"
      - "It's harder to give than receive"

  managing_up_disagreement:
    approach: |
      - Acknowledge their perspective and constraints
      - Ask permission: "Can I share a different perspective?"
      - Frame as helping them succeed
      - Provide alternatives, not just objections
      - Ultimately support the decision even if you disagree
    key_principles:
      - "They have context you don't have"
      - "Your job is to inform, their job is to decide"
      - "Disagree privately, support publicly"
      - "Choose your battles wisely"

  addressing_pattern_behavior:
    approach: |
      - Describe the pattern, not just one incident
      - "I've noticed X happening several times"
      - Share cumulative impact
      - Ask what's going on for them
      - Set clear expectations going forward
    key_principles:
      - "Patterns matter more than incidents"
      - "Be specific with examples"
      - "There may be underlying causes"
      - "Set future expectations clearly"

  delivering_unwelcome_news:
    approach: |
      - Be direct and clear (no burying the lead)
      - Show empathy for their reaction
      - Explain the reasoning
      - Allow them to react and process
      - Discuss path forward
    key_principles:
      - "Direct is kind, vague is cruel"
      - "Don't soften to the point of confusion"
      - "Their reaction is not your emergency"
      - "Give them time to process"

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - Assessed situation and your own readiness before engaging
  - Genuinely attempted to understand their perspective first
  - Identified shared interests and common ground
  - Used I-statements and avoided blame language
  - Listened more than talked during the conversation
  - Reached specific, actionable agreement or understanding
  - Planned relationship repair and prevention measures

failure_modes:
  - mode: Engaging while triggered
    symptom: Escalate the conflict, say things you regret, damage relationship
    resolution: Check emotional readiness before engaging; take a break if needed

  - mode: Positional arguing
    symptom: '"I want X" "Well I want Y" - stuck on positions, no progress'
    resolution: Ask "Why is that important to you?" to find underlying interests

  - mode: Listening to respond
    symptom: Forming your rebuttal while they talk, not actually understanding
    resolution: Practice reflecting back what they said before responding

  - mode: Character attacks
    symptom: '"You always..." "You''re being..." - attacks on person not behavior'
    resolution: Describe specific behaviors and their impact, not character

  - mode: Kitchen-sinking
    symptom: Bringing up every past grievance, overwhelming the conversation
    resolution: Focus on one issue at a time; schedule separate conversations for other issues

  - mode: Avoiding the conversation
    symptom: Issue festers, relationship deteriorates, eventually explodes
    resolution: Address issues early when they're small and easier to resolve

  - mode: Pseudo-resolution
    symptom: '"Fine" or superficial agreement without real resolution'
    resolution: Check understanding, get specific commitments, schedule follow-up

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: Addressing tension with colleague over work style
    context: Friction with teammate who has different work style, affecting collaboration
    inputs:
      conflict_situation: "Ongoing tension with Alex about work style - they push for quick decisions while I want more analysis"
      other_party: "Alex, peer on same team, 6 months working together, good results but increasing friction"
      your_perspective: "Their push for speed feels like they don't value thorough work; my concerns get dismissed"
      their_likely_perspective: "I probably seem slow or indecisive; they might feel blocked by my process"
      relationship_importance: "important"
      escalation_level: "active_conflict"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Situation Assessment:
      - Type: Process/working style conflict (not personal attack)
      - Escalation: Active - we're avoiding each other, tension in meetings
      - History: Getting worse over 3 months
      - Self-check: I'm frustrated but can have a calm conversation
      - My contribution: I may be inflexible, may seem to question their judgment

      Step 2 - Their Perspective:
      - They value momentum and shipping
      - They may feel I'm blocking progress with endless analysis
      - Underlying interests: Recognition for results, autonomy, making impact
      - Charitable interpretation: They're trying to help us succeed faster
      - Valid point: Analysis paralysis is a real risk; we have shipped late before

      Step 3 - Common Ground:
      - Shared: We both want the project to succeed
      - Shared: We both want good working relationship
      - Shared: We both bring valuable skills
      - Complementary: Speed AND quality both matter
      - True conflict: Timeline pressure requires prioritizing one approach sometimes

      Step 4 - Conversation Plan:
      Opening: "Alex, I've been thinking about our working relationship. I value what you bring, and I want to figure out how we can work together better. Can we talk about this?"
      Questions to ask:
      - "How do you see our dynamic?"
      - "What's frustrating from your perspective?"
      - "What would an ideal collaboration look like for you?"
    expected_output:
      conversation_plan:
        opening: "Alex, I've been thinking about how we work together. I appreciate your push for momentum, and I know my thoroughness can feel slow. I'd like to find a better rhythm. Can we talk?"
        key_points:
          - "I respect your drive to ship and make impact"
          - "Sometimes I feel my concerns get dismissed - I want to understand your view"
          - "I suspect my process feels blocking to you - is that right?"
          - "How do we get the benefit of both our approaches?"
        desired_outcome: "Agreement on how to work together that honors both styles"
      resolution_outcome:
        agreement:
          - "Time-box analysis: agree on analysis duration upfront"
          - "Alex will ask 'what would you need to feel confident?' instead of dismissing"
          - "I will lead with recommendation, not just concerns"
          - "Weekly sync to address friction early"
        follow_up: "Check in after 2 weeks to see if it's working"

  - name: Mediating conflict between two team members
    context: Two direct reports in ongoing conflict affecting team dynamics
    inputs:
      conflict_situation: "Jordan and Morgan have been in conflict for weeks - passive aggressive comments, avoiding collaboration, others are noticing"
      other_party: "Both are my direct reports, both valuable, conflict is about project ownership"
      your_perspective: "Both have valid points; lack of clear ownership created this; I need to resolve it and set up better structure"
      relationship_importance: "critical"
      escalation_level: "active_conflict"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Assessment:
      - This is about unclear ownership + both feeling unrecognized
      - I contributed by not clarifying roles earlier
      - Can't pick a side; need to facilitate their resolution

      Step 2 - Understand Both Perspectives:
      - Meet with each separately first to understand their view
      - Jordan: Feels Morgan takes over their ideas, doesn't get credit
      - Morgan: Feels Jordan doesn't execute, they have to step in
      - Both want: Recognition, clear ownership, good outcome

      Step 3 - Mediation Approach:
      - Bring them together after individual conversations
      - Set ground rules: Listen without interrupting, focus on future
      - Help them see shared interests
      - Facilitate solution they own (not imposed by me)
    expected_output:
      mediation_plan:
        individual_meetings:
          purpose: "Understand each perspective privately"
          questions:
            - "How do you see the situation?"
            - "What do you need going forward?"
            - "What role might you be playing in this?"
