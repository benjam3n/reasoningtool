description: Systematic procedure for listening deeply to understand others, build trust, and improve communication outcomes

long_description: |
  The Active Listening procedure provides a framework for truly hearing and understanding
  what others are communicating - both verbally and nonverbally. Most people listen to
  respond; active listening means listening to understand first.

  This procedure covers:
  - Listening techniques (full attention, suspending judgment)
  - Paraphrasing and reflection (confirming understanding)
  - Asking powerful questions (deepening understanding)
  - Reading nonverbal cues (hearing what's not said)
  - Creating psychological safety (encouraging authentic sharing)

  Key principles:
  - Seek first to understand, then to be understood
  - Listening is not passive - it requires full engagement
  - People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care
  - The best insights come from following curiosity, not checklists
  - Silence is a powerful listening tool

# ============================================
# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:
  - One-on-one meetings where understanding the other person is key
  - Gathering requirements or feedback from users or stakeholders
  - Performance conversations and career discussions
  - Coaching and mentoring conversations
  - Conflict resolution where understanding perspectives is essential

# PROCEDURE
# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Prepare to listen
    action: |
      Before the conversation, set yourself up for quality listening:

      Mental preparation:
      1. Set an intention: "My goal is to understand their perspective"
      2. Acknowledge your biases: What assumptions might you bring?
      3. Clear your mind: Let go of what you'll say next
      4. Adopt genuine curiosity: Treat this as a learning opportunity
      5. Remember: You can respond later; first, understand

      Practical preparation:
      1. Remove distractions (close laptop, silence phone, find quiet space)
      2. Allow adequate time (don't schedule tight)
      3. Prepare open questions you want to explore
      4. Review what you know about this person and topic
      5. Consider what might be difficult for them to share
    inputs:
      - conversation_purpose
      - other_person
      - listening_challenges (optional)
    outputs:
      - listening_intention: what you're trying to understand
      - potential_biases: assumptions to watch for
      - prepared_questions: open questions to start exploration
    verification: |
      Can state what you're genuinely curious about
      Identified at least one bias or assumption to watch

  - id: 2
    name: Create psychological safety
    action: |
      Make it safe for them to share openly:

      Establishing safety:
      1. Start with genuine warmth and connection
      2. Signal that you're here to understand, not judge
      3. Make it clear that their perspective matters
      4. If sensitive topic, acknowledge difficulty
      5. Affirm confidentiality if appropriate

      Nonverbal safety signals:
      - Open body posture (uncrossed arms, leaning in slightly)
      - Appropriate eye contact (not staring, not avoiding)
      - Calm, unhurried presence
      - Match their energy level (don't be overly enthusiastic if they're serious)

      Verbal safety signals:
      - "I really want to understand how you see this"
      - "There's no wrong answer here"
      - "I'm curious about your perspective"
      - "Take your time"
    inputs:
      - other_person
      - conversation_context (optional)
    outputs:
      - safety_approach: how you'll create an open environment
      - opening_words: how you'll start the conversation
    verification: |
      Opening creates space for honest sharing
      Your presence is calm and inviting, not pressured

  - id: 3
    name: Listen with full attention
    action: |
      Give complete, undivided attention:

      Full presence:
      1. Clear your mind of what you'll say next
      2. Focus entirely on what they're saying
      3. Notice both words AND how they're saying them
      4. Listen for what's NOT being said
      5. Resist the urge to interrupt, even to agree

      What to listen for:
      - CONTENT: What are the facts and events?
      - FEELINGS: What emotions are underneath?
      - VALUES: What matters to them about this?
      - NEEDS: What do they want or need?
      - REQUESTS: Is there something they're asking for?

      Managing internal distractions:
      - Notice when your mind wanders and bring it back
      - If you start formulating your response, stop
      - If you disagree internally, park it and keep listening
      - If something is unclear, note it to ask about later
    inputs:
      - The conversation itself
    outputs:
      - content_heard: the facts and events they shared
      - emotions_noticed: feelings you observed
      - values_detected: what seems to matter to them
      - needs_inferred: what they might want or need
    verification: |
      Can summarize what they said accurately
      Noticed emotional undertones, not just facts

  - id: 4
    name: Use silence strategically
    action: |
      Silence is a powerful listening tool:

      Why silence matters:
      - People often have more to say if given space
      - Important insights often come after initial thoughts
      - Silence signals you're not rushing them
      - Your quiet presence encourages deeper reflection

      How to use silence:
      1. After they finish speaking, wait 2-3 seconds before responding
      2. If they seem to have more, say nothing and maintain eye contact
      3. Use "mm-hmm" or nodding to encourage without interrupting
      4. Resist filling silence with your thoughts

      When silence reveals more:
      - After emotional statements (let them sit with it)
      - When they say "I don't know" (often they do know, they need space)
      - After a long explanation (they may want to add something)
      - When you sense there's more underneath
    inputs:
      - The conversation flow
    outputs:
      - additional_insights: what emerged from holding space
    verification: |
      Allowed meaningful pauses without jumping in
      Their deeper thoughts emerged because you waited

  - id: 5
    name: Paraphrase and reflect
    action: |
      Confirm understanding by reflecting back what you heard:

      Paraphrasing content:
      - "So what you're saying is..."
      - "Let me make sure I understand..."
      - "If I'm hearing you right..."
      - "It sounds like the key issue is..."

      Reflecting emotions:
      - "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about..."
      - "I hear some excitement when you talk about..."
      - "That seems like it was really difficult"
      - "You seem torn about this"

      Why this matters:
      - Confirms you understood (or gives them chance to correct)
      - Shows you're really listening (people feel heard)
      - Slows down the conversation for depth
      - Helps them clarify their own thinking

      Guidelines:
      - Use your own words, not just repeating theirs
      - Keep it brief - this is a check, not a summary
      - End with openness: "Is that right?" or "Did I get that?"
      - Don't add your interpretation or opinion yet
    inputs:
      - content_heard (from Step 3)
      - emotions_noticed (from Step 3)
    outputs:
      - paraphrase_checks: reflections offered and their responses
      - corrected_understanding: where your understanding was adjusted
    verification: |
      Paraphrased at least 2-3 times during conversation
      They confirmed or corrected your understanding

  - id: 6
    name: Ask powerful questions
    action: |
      Use questions to deepen understanding:

      Open questions that explore:
      - "Can you tell me more about...?"
      - "What was that like for you?"
      - "What matters most to you about this?"
      - "How did you feel when that happened?"
      - "What do you think is really going on here?"

      Questions that go deeper:
      - "And what else?" (often gets to the real answer)
      - "What's the hardest part about this?"
      - "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
      - "What would success look like?"
      - "What aren't we talking about that we should be?"

      Clarifying questions:
      - "When you say X, what do you mean by that?"
      - "Can you give me an example?"
      - "What led you to that conclusion?"
      - "How does this connect to...?"

      Questions to avoid:
      - Leading questions (with your answer embedded)
      - Rapid-fire questions (overwhelms)
      - Why questions that sound judgmental ("Why did you do that?")
      - Questions that are really opinions ("Don't you think...?")

      The magic question:
      - "And what else?" - Use it repeatedly. The first answer is rarely the fullest.
    inputs:
      - content_heard (from Step 3)
      - prepared_questions (from Step 1)
    outputs:
      - questions_asked: key questions and what they revealed
      - deeper_understanding: insights that emerged from good questions
    verification: |
      Asked mostly open questions (not yes/no)
      Used "And what else?" at least once
      Questions came from curiosity, not agenda

  - id: 7
    name: Read nonverbal cues
    action: |
      Listen with your eyes as well as your ears:

      Body language to notice:
      - Posture: Open or closed? Leaning in or pulling back?
      - Eyes: Contact or avoidance? Engaged or distracted?
      - Hands: Relaxed or tense? Gesturing or still?
      - Face: Matching their words? Microexpressions?
      - Energy: Higher or lower than their words suggest?

      What incongruence might mean:
      - Words say "fine" but body says stressed: explore further
      - Enthusiasm in voice but arms crossed: possible reservation
      - Confident words but avoiding eye contact: uncertainty underneath
      - Quick to move on from topic: might be more there

      How to use what you notice:
      - Note patterns, not single signals (one crossed arm isn't definitive)
      - Gently invite: "I notice you seem a bit tense when we talk about this..."
      - Check in: "How are you feeling about this conversation?"
      - Don't assume: Your interpretation might be wrong
    inputs:
      - The conversation observation
    outputs:
      - nonverbal_observations: what body language you noticed
      - incongruence_noted: where words and nonverbals didn't match
      - follow_up_needed: topics that seemed to have more underneath
    verification: |
      Noticed at least 2-3 nonverbal signals
      Explored at least one apparent incongruence

  - id: 8
    name: Summarize and confirm understanding
    action: |
      At key moments and at the end, synthesize what you've heard:

      Key moment summaries:
      - After they've shared something significant
      - Before moving to a new topic
      - When the conversation has been complex

      End of conversation summary:
      1. Main points: "Here's what I'm taking away..."
      2. Feelings: "It seems like you're feeling..."
      3. Needs/desires: "What's most important to you is..."
      4. Confirmation: "Did I get that right?"

      Summary technique:
      - Be concise (not a transcript)
      - Use their key words and phrases
      - Capture essence, not just facts
      - Include emotions and values, not just content
      - Leave room for them to correct or add

      After confirmation:
      - Ask if there's anything else they want to add
      - Thank them for sharing
      - If applicable, discuss next steps
    inputs:
      - All understanding gathered
    outputs:
      - understanding_summary: complete synthesis of what you learned
      - confirmed_understanding: what they agreed you understood correctly
      - open_threads: topics to explore further in future
    verification: |
      Provided summary that they confirmed or corrected
      Asked if there was anything else before closing

      - They said "exactly" or "yes, that's it"
      - They seemed relieved or lighter
      - You learned something new
      - They thanked you for listening

      Signs to improve:
      - You did most of the talking
      - You were thinking about your response while they spoke

# EXAMPLES
# ============================================
examples:
  - name: One-on-one with direct report about career concerns
    context: Regular 1:1 where team member seems disengaged lately
    inputs:
      conversation_purpose: "Understand what's going on - they've seemed off lately"
      other_person: "Direct report for 18 months, usually engaged, recently seems checked out"
      conversation_context: "one_on_one"
      time_available: 45
      listening_challenges:
        - "I tend to jump to solutions"
        - "I might be defensive if it's about my management"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Preparation:
      - Intention: Understand their experience, not fix immediately
      - Biases to watch: Might assume it's about compensation; might get defensive
      - Questions: "How are you really doing?" "What's on your mind lately?"

      Step 2 - Create safety:
      - Start casual, then: "I've noticed you seem a bit different lately. I wanted to check in and hear what's going on for you. Whatever you share, I just want to understand."

      Step 3 - Listen:
      - They share: feeling stuck, don't see growth path, considering other options
      - Emotions: frustration, some sadness, maybe fear of disappointing me
      - Values: growth, being challenged, making impact
      - Needs: clearer path forward, to feel valued

      Step 5 - Paraphrase:
      "So it sounds like you're feeling stuck - like you've been doing good work but can't see where it leads. And that's making you question whether to stay. Did I get that right?"

      Step 6 - Questions:
      - "And what else is contributing to this feeling?"
      - "What would a good growth path look like for you?"
      - "What matters most to you about your next step?"

      Step 7 - Nonverbal:
      - They avoided eye contact when mentioning other options - might be uncomfortable telling me
      - Energy picked up when describing what they want - that's what they're drawn to
    expected_output:
      understanding_summary:
        content: "Feeling plateaued after 18 months; can't see growth path; considering external options"
        emotions: "Frustrated, somewhat anxious about future, conflicted about loyalty"
        values: "Growth, being challenged, making visible impact"
        needs: "Clear path forward, recognition of potential, challenging work"
      follow_up_items:
        - "Schedule follow-up to discuss specific growth options"
        - "Research internal opportunities that match their interests"
        - "Reflect on whether I've been giving enough growth opportunity"
      listening_reflection:
        what_worked: "Didn't jump to solutions; they shared more than expected"
        to_improve: "Initially felt defensive about 'considering options'; worked through it"
        surprise: "It's not about money; it's about growth and challenge"

  - name: Customer discovery interview
    context: Understanding user needs for product development
    inputs:
      conversation_purpose: "Understand their workflow and pain points deeply"
      other_person: "Potential customer, operations manager, agreed to 30-minute call"
      conversation_context: "discovery"
      time_available: 30
      listening_challenges:
        - "Might lead toward our solution instead of understanding their reality"
        - "Time pressure might make me rush"
    process: |
      Step 1 - Preparation:
      - Intention: Understand their world, not pitch our solution
      - Biases: Might hear confirmation of what we want to build
      - Questions: "Walk me through a typical day" "What's the hardest part?"

      Step 2 - Create safety:
      - "I'm not here to sell you anything today. I just want to understand how you work and what's challenging. The more honest you are, the more helpful this is."

      Step 3-6 - Listen and explore:
      - Use "And what else?" repeatedly
      - Follow their energy - where do they get animated?
      - Paraphrase their pain points to confirm understanding
      - Ask for specific examples, not generalizations

      Step 8 - Summary:
      "Let me make sure I understood. Your biggest challenge is X, which costs you Y hours per week. You've tried A and B but they didn't work because of C. Ideally, you'd want something that does D. Is that right?"
