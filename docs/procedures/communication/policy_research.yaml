description: Identify evidence-based, neglected, tractable policies for advocacy campaigns

long_description: |
  The Policy Research procedure systematically identifies and evaluates policy
  opportunities for advocacy campaigns using a five-criteria scoring framework:
  evidence quality, cost-effectiveness, neglectedness, tractability, and impact.

  This procedure ensures advocacy resources are directed toward policies where
  marginal effort can produce the greatest positive outcomes. It emphasizes
  finding genuinely neglected opportunities where new advocacy can make a difference.

  Key principles:
  - Evidence base determines credibility with policymakers
  - Neglectedness multiplies marginal impact of advocacy
  - Tractability determines realistic chance of success
  - Cost-effectiveness ensures efficient resource use
  - Diversity of policies builds broader coalition potential

# ============================================
# APPLICABILITY
# ============================================
when_to_use:

# PROCEDURE
# ============================================
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Source identification and review
    action: |
      Systematically review primary sources for policy candidates:
      1. Review Open Philanthropy focus areas for EA-aligned priorities
      2. Check Niskanen Center for evidence-based, bipartisan options
      3. Review Brookings Institution for research-backed recommendations
      4. Check RAND Corporation for policy analysis
      5. Review CBO for cost-benefit analyzed policies
      6. Check 80,000 Hours problem profiles for high-impact areas
      7. Search secondary sources (CRS, GAO, academic journals)

      For each promising policy found:
      - Note specific actionable recommendation
      - Record evidence cited
      - Check current advocacy level
      - Add to candidates list
    inputs:
      - policy_areas
      - constraints (optional)
    outputs:
      - policy_candidates: list of 20+ candidates with initial notes

    verification: |
      At least 20 candidate policies identified across multiple sources

  - id: 2
    name: Initial screening
    action: |
      Apply quick filters to narrow candidate list:
      1. Has specific actionable ask (bill, executive action, regulation)
      2. Has some evidence base (not purely theoretical)
      3. Not already heavily advocated (check OpenSecrets lobbying data)
      4. Plausible path to implementation
      5. Aligns with any specified constraints

      Mark each candidate as: Promising / Maybe / Unlikely
    inputs:
      - policy_candidates (from Step 1)
      - constraints (optional)
    outputs:

  - id: 3
    name: Deep scoring
    action: |
      Score each filtered candidate on five criteria (1-10 scale):

      Evidence (weight 0.25):
      - 1-3: Theoretical only
      - 4-6: Observational studies
      - 7-10: RCTs or meta-analyses
      Sources: Google Scholar, CBO reports, CRS reports

      Cost-Effectiveness (weight 0.20):
      - 1-3: Unclear ROI
      - 4-6: Moderate ROI

      Sources: CBO cost estimates, academic cost-benefit analyses

      Neglectedness (weight 0.20):
      - 1-3: Major advocacy already exists
      - 4-6: Some advocacy present
      - 7-10: Little or no organized advocacy
      Check: OpenSecrets lobbying data, news search, think tank activity

      Tractability (weight 0.20):
      - 1-3: Major opposition, unlikely to pass

      Indicators: Recent votes, legislator statements, political climate

      Impact (weight 0.15):
      - 1-3: Less than 100K affected
      - 4-6: 100K to 1M affected
      - 7-10: More than 1M affected
      Measurement: Population affected, severity, duration

    inputs:
      - policy_candidates (from Step 1)
      - scored_policies (from Step 3)

    verification: |
      All policies in database with complete scoring data

# ============================================
# QUALITY
# ============================================
verification:
  - At least 20 policies reviewed across multiple sources
  - All candidates scored on all five criteria with documentation
  - Selected policies meet 6.0+ threshold
  - Diversity requirements met (political, committee)
  - One-page briefs are clear, professional, and complete
  - Evidence summaries include counterargument rebuttals
  - Database fully populated with scoring data

failure_modes:
  - mode: Insufficient candidate diversity
    symptom: All candidates cluster in one policy area or political lean
    resolution: Explicitly search additional areas; use diversity as search criterion

  - mode: Evidence score inflation
    symptom: High evidence scores for policies with only observational data
    resolution: Apply strict RCT/meta-analysis standard for 7+ scores; document study types

  - mode: Neglectedness miscalculation
    symptom: Selected policy actually has significant existing advocacy
    resolution: Deep check OpenSecrets, recent news, and active lobbying registrations

  - mode: Tractability optimism
    symptom: Selected policies have unrealistic chance of passage
    resolution: Check recent similar votes; interview staffers if possible; be conservative

  - mode: Brief too technical
    symptom: Legislative staff find brief hard to understand
    resolution: Test with non-expert reader; lead with impact, not methodology

  - mode: Missing counterarguments
    symptom: Unprepared for objections in meetings
    resolution: Explicitly research opposition arguments; develop evidence-based rebuttals
