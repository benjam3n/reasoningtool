  Extract the underlying GOAL JOURNEY from any source:
  books, videos, PDFs, conversations, experiences.

  A goal journey is a CHAIN OF GOALS:
  Action → Goal → Goal → ... → Intrinsic Goal

  This is NOT a narrative arc. It's a PURPOSE CHAIN.

core_insight: |
  Every action serves a goal. Every goal serves another goal.
  The chain terminates at intrinsic goals (valued for themselves).

  Extraction reveals:
  - What goal chain was operating?
  - What pattern does the chain follow?
  - Is the chain valid (each step serves the next)?

  A well-extracted goal journey:
  - Shows clear service relationships (each step serves the next)
  - Terminates at legitimate intrinsic goal
  - Has a pattern that transfers to other situations

key_distinction: |
  WRONG (narrative): "Hero faces trials, persists, succeeds"
  RIGHT (goal chain): "Action → Immediate goal → Deeper goal → Intrinsic goal"

  Narrative asks: What happened?
  Goal journey asks: What did this serve?

# ============================================
# INPUT TYPES
# ============================================

inputs:
  source_types:
    - narrative: "Story with characters and plot (fiction, biography)"
    - instructional: "How-to content (tutorials, guides, courses)"
    - analytical: "Case studies, research, theory"
    - experiential: "Personal or observed experience"
    - conversational: "Dialogue, interview, discussion"
    - abstract: "Philosophy, frameworks, models"

  required:
    - source_material: "The content to extract from"
    - source_type: "One of the above types"

  optional:
    - focus_area: "What aspect to focus on (protagonist, concept, method)"
    - desired_abstraction: "How general should the output be"

# ============================================
# EXTRACTION STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: "Identify the action"
    action: |
      What action is being taken (or was taken)?

      Be specific about what was DONE, not what happened.

      NOT: "John succeeded"
      BUT: "Person invested years developing expertise in domain"

      The action is the bottom of the goal chain.

    output: action_statement

  - id: 2
    name: "Ask: What goal did this action serve?"
    action: |
      Every action serves a goal. What was this action trying to achieve?

      NOT: "What happened next?"
      BUT: "What was this action FOR?"

      Example:
      Action: "Invested years developing expertise"
      Goal: "Become highly capable in the domain"

    output: immediate_goal

  - id: 3
    name: "Ask: What goal did THAT goal serve?"
    action: |
      The goal you identified is also instrumental.
      What does achieving that goal enable?

      Example:
      Goal: "Become highly capable in the domain"
      Serves: "Be able to create significant work"

      Keep going:
      Goal: "Create significant work"
      Serves: "Have meaningful impact"

    output: goal_chain (growing)

  - id: 4
    name: "Continue until intrinsic goal (use value elicitation)"
    action: |
      Keep asking "What's important to you about that?" until circularity.

      Circularity indicators:
      - "Because that's what I value"
      - "That's just what matters"
      - "I just do"

      IMPORTANT:
      - Don't assume "flourishing" or any default terminus
      - Different people have different intrinsic goals
      - Some have anti-flourishing goals (asceticism, simplicity)
      - Apply intrinsic_goal_termination_gate if unsure

      Example chain:
      Action: Invested years developing expertise
        → Goal: Become highly capable
        → Goal: Create significant work
        → Goal: Have meaningful impact
        → INTRINSIC: [Varies - Meaning for some, Recognition for others,
                      Mastery for others - discover via elicitation]

    output: complete_goal_chain

  - id: 4b
    name: "Check for additional intrinsic goals"
    action: |
      Ask: "Is there anything else important about [original action/goal]?"

      People often have MULTIPLE intrinsic goals.
      Don't stop at the first one found.

      If yes: Trace the new chain (repeat steps 2-4)
      If no: Proceed to step 5

      Example:
      First chain: Expertise → Impact → Meaning
      Second chain: Expertise → Recognition → Status

      This person has TWO intrinsic goals: Meaning AND Status

    output: all_intrinsic_goals

  - id: 4c
    name: "Check for conflicts between intrinsic goals"
    action: |
      If multiple intrinsic goals found:
      Ask: "Do these ever conflict?"

      Common conflicts:
      - Freedom vs Security
      - Meaning vs Recognition
      - Achievement vs Peace
      - Connection vs Independence

      Note the conflict - the person will need to balance.

    output: conflicts (if any)

  - id: 5
    name: "Verify the chain"
    action: |
      Read the chain from bottom (action) to top (intrinsic):
      - Does each step SERVE the next? (not just "lead to")
      - Are there missing links?
      - Is the intrinsic goal legitimate?

      If there's a jump:
      "Become highly capable" → ??? → "Live meaningful life"

      Find the missing link:
      "Become highly capable" → "Create significant work" → "Have impact" → "Live meaningful life"

    output: verified_chain

  - id: 4
    name: "Generalize each step"
    action: |
      For each step in the raw path, find the semi-generalizable form.

      Use the generalization rules:
      - Names → Roles (John → Person, Leader, Seeker)
      - Specific things → Categories (Gibson guitar → Tool, Resource)
      - Specific places → Contexts (Sam's shop → Marketplace)
      - Specific actions → Action types (bought → Acquired, Obtained)
      - Specific outcomes → Outcome types (got promoted → Advanced)

      Test each step:
      - Too specific? Abstract further
      - Too abstract? Add back some specificity
      - Semi-generalizable: Can apply to 10-1000 other situations

      Example:
      Specific: "Got promoted to VP after the merger"
      Too abstract: "Status changed"
      Semi-generalizable: "Person advanced through organizational transition"

    output: generalized_path (list of semi-generalizable steps)

  - id: 5
    name: "Identify key transitions"
    action: |
      Find the moments where the journey CHANGED significantly.

      Types of transitions:
      - Choice points: "Could have gone either way, chose this"
      - Thresholds: "Entered new territory, can't go back"
      - Transformations: "Became different than before"
      - Revelations: "Understood differently than before"
      - Reversals: "Direction changed completely"
      - Crises: "Everything at stake"

      For each transition:
      - Which step is it?
      - What type of transition?
      - What makes it significant?

      These are often the most transferable parts - the SHAPE of change.

    output: key_transitions (list of {step, type, significance})

  - id: 6
    name: "Classify the journey archetype"
    action: |
      Match the journey to archetypes:

      Complexity: simple | complicated | complex | chaotic
      Difficulty: easy | challenging | hard | seemingly_impossible
      Predictability: predictable | twist | reversal | emergent
      Frequency: universal | common | uncommon | rare

      Also check classic structures:
      - Hero's journey
      - Tragedy
      - Comedy
      - Rags to riches
      - Voyage and return

      A journey may match multiple archetypes partially.

    output: archetype_classification

  - id: 7
    name: "Test generalizability"
    action: |
      Test: Can this journey apply to other situations?

      Try instantiating in:
      1. A different domain (if business → personal; if art → science)
      2. A different scale (if individual → group; if small → large)
      3. A different context (if modern → historical; if Western → other)

      For each test:
      - Does the structure still make sense?
      - Do the transitions still apply?
      - Would someone in that situation recognize this journey?

      If it fails to transfer:
      - The journey is too specific - generalize more
      - Or it's a genuinely unique journey - note this

    output: generalizability_assessment

  - id: 8
    name: "Test satisfaction"
    action: |
      Test: Does this journey feel complete and meaningful?

      Check:
      - Beginning → Middle → End present?
      - Movement/change throughout (not static)?
      - Stakes clear (something matters)?
      - Resolution provides closure (even if tragic)?
      - Emotional shape recognizable?

      If unsatisfying:
      - Missing steps? Add them
      - Wrong ending? Find true endpoint
      - No stakes? Find what was at risk
      - Random feeling? Find underlying pattern

    output: satisfaction_assessment

# BATCH EXTRACTION
# ============================================

batch_extraction:
  description: |
    For extracting multiple journeys from a single source (like a book).

  process:
    - id: 1
      action: |
        Scan source for journey candidates:
        - Protagonist arcs
        - Concept developments
        - Method progressions
        - Case outcomes
        - Argument structures

    - id: 2
      action: |
        Prioritize by:
        - Significance (central vs peripheral)
        - Generalizability (transferable vs unique)
        - Completeness (full journey vs fragment)

    - id: 3
      action: |
        Extract top journeys using main procedure

    - id: 4
      action: |
        Cross-reference: Do extracted journeys relate?
        - Part of larger journey?
        - Parallel journeys?
        - Contrasting journeys?

# INTEGRATION WITH PDF EXTRACTION
# ============================================

pdf_integration:
  description: |
    Extend existing PDF extraction pipeline to include journey extraction.

  additions:
    to_extraction_prompt: |
      In addition to procedures, extract JOURNEYS from this content:

      A journey is the path from a starting state to an ending state.
      Look for:
      - Character arcs (person goes from X to Y)
      - Concept developments (idea evolves from simple to complex)
      - Case progressions (situation changes over time)
      - Learning paths (understanding deepens)

      For each journey found:
      1. Identify start and end points
      2. Trace the steps between
      3. Generalize each step (not too specific, not too abstract)
      4. Identify key transitions (turning points)
      5. Note the archetype (simple/complicated, easy/hard, etc.)

      Output journeys in this format:
      ```yaml
      journey:
        title: "[Name]"
        steps: ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...]
        key_transitions: [{step: N, type: "...", description: "..."}]
        archetype: {complexity: ..., difficulty: ..., etc.}
        applicability: ["Applies to...", "Also applies to..."]
      ```

  to_validation: |
    For each extracted journey, verify:
    - Steps are semi-generalizable (not too specific/abstract)
    - Journey passes generalizability test
    - Journey passes satisfaction test
    - Applicability list makes sense

  to_storage: |
    Store journeys in:
    library/journeys/
      by_source/[source_name]/
      by_archetype/[archetype]/
      by_domain/[domain]/
