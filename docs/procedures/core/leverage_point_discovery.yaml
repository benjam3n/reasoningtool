goal: |
  Find high-leverage opportunities by identifying gaps between systems
  (arbitrage) or friction points within systems (insertion opportunities).
  Systematic search across leverage types reduces intelligence needed.

description: |
  Most valuable strategies exploit leverage points - places where small
  effort produces disproportionate results. This procedure searches for
  multiple types of leverage:

  PRIMARY TYPES (position-based):
  1. ARBITRAGE: Position yourself between disconnected systems/markets
     that have inefficient information/price/value flow.
     Example: Dropshipping (supplier market ↔ you ↔ retail market)

  2. SYSTEM INSERTION: Insert yourself into an existing system's flow
     where there's friction, complexity, or unmet needs.
     Example: Payment processors (buyer → you → seller)

  ADDITIONAL TYPES (extensible):
  - Network effects, compounding, automation, aggregation
  - Scarcity, standards, trust/reputation, data/learning, optionality

  All leverage types find where value is trapped, flowing inefficiently,
  or could be amplified with the right positioning.

when_to_use:
  - Looking for business/strategy opportunities
  - Want high-leverage approaches (small input, large output)
  - Searching for competitive advantages
  - Exploring new markets or niches
  - Want to avoid competing on pure effort/resources

# PROCEDURE STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: "Map the Landscape"
    action: |
      Identify all the systems, markets, and flows in the domain.

      Ask:
      - What are the major systems/markets?
      - Who are the players (buyers, sellers, intermediaries)?
      - What flows between them (money, goods, information, attention)?
      - Where are the boundaries between systems?
    output: "System/market map"
    template: |
      SYSTEMS/MARKETS IDENTIFIED:
      1. [System A]: [What it does, who's in it]
      2. [System B]: [What it does, who's in it]
      ...

      FLOWS:
      - [Flow 1]: [What moves, from where to where]
      - [Flow 2]: [What moves, from where to where]
      ...

      BOUNDARIES:
      - [Boundary 1]: [What separates System A from B]
      ...

  - id: 2
    name: "Search for Arbitrage Opportunities"
    action: |
      Look for gaps BETWEEN systems where value/information flows
      inefficiently or not at all.

      For each pair of systems, ask:
      - Is there a price difference? (buy low, sell high)
      - Is there an information asymmetry? (know something one side doesn't)
      - Is there a timing gap? (faster than the market corrects)
      - Is there a geographic gap? (available here, needed there)
      - Is there an access gap? (you can reach both, they can't reach each other)
      - Is there a format gap? (incompatible systems you could bridge)
    output: "Arbitrage opportunities"

  - id: 3
    name: "Search for Insertion Opportunities"
    action: |
      Look for friction points WITHIN existing flows where you could
      insert yourself to add value.

      For each flow, ask:
      - Where is it slow? (you could speed it up)
      - Where is it complex? (you could simplify it)
      - Where is it unreliable? (you could make it reliable)
      - Where is it expensive? (you could make it cheaper)
      - Where is it opaque? (you could make it transparent)
      - Where is trust lacking? (you could provide trust/verification)
      - Where do systems not talk? (you could translate/integrate)
      - Where do people struggle? (you could provide an easier interface)
    output: "Insertion opportunities"

  - id: 4
    name: "Search Other Leverage Types"
    action: |
      Go through additional leverage types and ask whether any apply.

      For each type, consider:
      - Network effects: What gets more valuable with more users?
      - Compounding: What builds on itself over time?
      - Automation: What manual work could be systematized?
      - Aggregation: What fragmented things could be combined?
      - Scarcity: What limited resources could you control?
      - Standards: What coordination problems need solving?
      - Trust: Where is credibility hard to establish?
      - Data: What learning loops could you create?
      - Optionality: What positions preserve future choices?
    output: "Additional leverage opportunities"

  - id: 5
    name: "Evaluate Each Opportunity"
    action: |
      For each opportunity found, assess:

      LEVERAGE FACTORS:
      - Value gap: How much value is currently lost/trapped?
      - Defensibility: Can others easily copy you?
      - Scalability: Can this grow without proportional effort?
      - Sustainability: Will this opportunity persist?

      FEASIBILITY FACTORS:
      - Access: Can you actually get into position?
      - Resources: Do you have what's needed?
      - Risk: What could go wrong?
      - Competition: Who else is trying this?
    output: "Evaluated opportunities"
    template: |
      OPPORTUNITY: [Name]
      TYPE: [Arbitrage / Insertion]

      THE GAP/FRICTION:
      [What inefficiency exists]

      YOUR POSITION:
      [How you would sit in the middle]

      VALUE CREATED:
      [What value you add or capture]
