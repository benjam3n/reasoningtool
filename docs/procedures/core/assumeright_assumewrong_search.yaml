# Assume Right Assume Wrong Search
# A recursive branching search strategy for exploring possibility space
# Core innovation: For every claim, explore both "what if right" and "what if wrong"

id: assumeright_assumewrong_search
name: Assume Right Assume Wrong Search
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core

description: |
  A recursive search strategy that explores possibility space by branching
  on every claim's validity. For each claim/guess, the system explores:

  - ASSUME RIGHT: Treat claim as closed (true, no alternatives), explore that world
  - ASSUME WRONG: Treat claim as open (false, has alternatives), explore alternatives

  This is applied recursively at every level, even to "foundations" that seem certain.
  The result is a complete map of possibility space.

purpose: |
  - Find alternatives that weren't visible
  - Uncover hidden assumptions at every level
  - Identify high-leverage points (assumptions that change everything if wrong)
  - Ensure no possibility is missed
  - Generate options the user didn't know they had

when_to_use: |
  - When processing any user input (goals, problems, questions, decisions)
  - When a situation seems to have "only one option"
  - When you want to stress-test assumptions
  - When exploring what could be different

# ============================================
# THE CORE MECHANISM
# ============================================

core_mechanism:
  description: |
    For every claim, create two branches:

    CLAIM: "X is true"
    ├── ASSUME RIGHT: X is true (closed, no alternatives)
    │   └── Explore: What follows from X being true?
    │
    └── ASSUME WRONG: X is false/uncertain (open, has alternatives)
        └── Explore: What alternatives to X exist?

    Then RECURSE on each branch, applying the same split.

  the_split:
    assume_right:
      meaning: "This claim is CLOSED - no alternatives exist"
      action: "Accept and explore what follows"
      question: "Given this is true, what's next?"

    assume_wrong:
      meaning: "This claim is OPEN - alternatives exist"
      action: "Find alternatives, explore each"
      question: "What if this isn't true? What else could be?"

  recursion: |
    Even "foundations" can be split:

    Level 0: "Doctor diagnosed condition X"
    ├── ASSUME RIGHT: Diagnosis is correct
    │   └── Explore treatment options
    └── ASSUME WRONG: Diagnosis might be incorrect
        ├── Level 1: "Doctor's certainty"
        │   ├── ASSUME RIGHT: Doctor was certain
        │   └── ASSUME WRONG: Doctor was guessing
        │       ├── Level 2: "Doctor's competence"
        │       │   ├── ASSUME RIGHT: Doctor is competent
        │       │   └── ASSUME WRONG: Doctor might not be competent
        │       │       ├── Level 3: "Doctor's training"
        │       │       │   ├── ASSUME RIGHT: Training was good
        │       │       │   └── ASSUME WRONG: Training was inadequate
        │       │       │       └── Level 4: "Training institution"
        │       │       │           └── ... continues ...

# ============================================
# THE PROCESS
# ============================================

process:
  step_1_parse:
    name: "Parse Input into Claims"
    action: |
      Take user input and identify all claims (explicit and implicit).
      Each claim is a candidate for the ASSUME RIGHT / ASSUME WRONG split.

    example:
      input: "I need $50k in 6 months for mom's surgery"
      claims:
        - "Mom needs surgery"
        - "Surgery costs $50k"
        - "Timeline is 6 months"
        - "I need to be the one to provide the money"
        - "Making money is the way to get $50k"
        - implicit: "Surgery is the only treatment option"
        - implicit: "This hospital is the only option"
        - implicit: "Doctor's diagnosis is correct"

  step_2_branch:
    name: "Create Branches for Each Claim"
    action: |
      For each claim, create the ASSUME RIGHT and ASSUME WRONG branches.

    example:
      claim: "Mom needs surgery"
      branches:
        assume_right:
          description: "Surgery is necessary"
          explore: "How to fund/execute surgery"
        assume_wrong:
          description: "Surgery might not be necessary"
          alternatives:
            - "Other treatments exist"
            - "Condition might resolve"
            - "Diagnosis might be wrong"
            - "Different procedure might work"

  step_3_recurse:
    name: "Recurse on Each Branch"
    action: |
      For each branch, identify new claims and apply the split again.
      Continue until hitting termination conditions.

    example:
      branch: "Diagnosis might be wrong"
      new_claims:
        - "Doctor made the diagnosis"
        - "Doctor used standard tests"
        - "Tests are accurate"
      each_claim_splits:
        - '"Doctor made diagnosis" → ASSUME RIGHT / ASSUME WRONG'
        - '"Doctor used standard tests" → ASSUME RIGHT / ASSUME WRONG'
        - '"Tests are accurate" → ASSUME RIGHT / ASSUME WRONG'

  step_4_map:
    name: "Build Possibility Tree"
    action: |
      Collect all branches into a tree structure.
      Track which paths have been explored.
      Identify high-leverage nodes (where ASSUME WRONG changes everything).

  step_5_filter:
    name: "Filter by User Context"
    action: |
      Not all branches are relevant to all users.
      Filter based on:
      - What can this user act on?
      - What would help vs. overwhelm?
      - What's the user's role/expertise?

    example:
      user_is_patient:
        show: "Funding options, hospital choices, timeline flexibility"
        hide: "Questioning diagnosis validity (not their expertise)"
      user_is_doctor:
        show: "Treatment alternatives, diagnostic certainty"
        hide: "Funding details (not their domain)"

  step_6_synthesize:
    name: "Synthesize Findings"
    action: |
      Combine insights from explored branches:
      - What alternatives were discovered?
      - What assumptions are high-leverage?
      - What questions should be asked?
      - What options does the user now have?

# ============================================
# TERMINATION CONDITIONS
# ============================================

termination:
  description: |
    The recursion must stop somewhere. Termination conditions:

  conditions:
    true_foundation:
      description: "Claim that cannot productively be questioned further"
      examples:
        - '"User stated they want X" (their preference is foundational)'
        - '"Document exists showing Y" (physical evidence)'
        - '"Law of physics Z" (cannot be assumed wrong)'
      note: "Even these CAN be questioned, but returns diminish"

    depth_limit:
      description: "Maximum recursion depth reached"
      default: 5
      note: "Configurable based on context"

    diminishing_returns:
      description: "Further branching unlikely to change outcomes"
      heuristic: "If ASSUME WRONG leads to same action as ASSUME RIGHT, stop"

    practical_irrelevance:
      description: "Branch doesn't affect what user can do"
      example: "Questioning medical training quality doesn't help patient decide"

    circular_reference:
      description: "Branch loops back to earlier claim"
      action: "Mark as circular, don't re-explore"

# ============================================
# HANDLING COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSION
# ============================================

combinatorial_explosion:
  problem: |
    With N claims and 2 branches each, the tree has 2^N leaves.
    10 claims = 1024 branches. 20 claims = 1 million branches.

  solutions:
    prioritization:
      description: "Explore high-leverage branches first"
      method: |
        Score each claim by: "If this is wrong, how much does it change?"
        Explore highest-impact claims first.

    pruning:
      description: "Cut branches that don't matter"
      method: |
        If ASSUME RIGHT and ASSUME WRONG lead to same action → prune
        If branch is outside user's control → prune (but note it)
        If branch has been explored before → reference, don't re-explore

    lazy_evaluation:
      description: "Don't explore until needed"
      method: |
        Generate branch structure but don't fully explore all paths.
        Explore on-demand when user asks or when relevant.

    parallel_exploration:
      description: "Explore multiple branches simultaneously"
      method: |
        If resources allow, explore branches in parallel.
        Combine findings at synthesis step.

    depth_limiting:
      description: "Cap recursion depth"
      method: |
        Default depth limit of 5 levels.
        Can be increased for critical decisions.

# INTEGRATION WITH GOSM
# ============================================

integration:
  with_quickstart:
    description: "ARAW Search is the engine behind Step 1 input processing"
    flow: |
      1. User provides input
      2. Parse into claims
      3. Run ARAW Search on each claim
      4. Filter results by user context
      5. Present relevant alternatives and questions

  with_goal_journey:
    description: "Each step in goal journey can be ARAW searched"
    flow: |
      Goal Journey: Action → Goal → Goal → Intrinsic

      For each step:
      - ASSUME RIGHT: This step is correct
      - ASSUME WRONG: This step might be wrong
        - Are there alternative actions?
        - Are there alternative goals?
        - Is the connection between steps valid?

  with_failure_detection:
    description: "ARAW Search can reveal failure patterns"
    flow: |
      Claim: "I want to achieve X"
      ASSUME RIGHT: User wants X → proceed
      ASSUME WRONG: User might not actually want X
        → Check for sustainable failure
        → Check for strategic suboptimization
        → Maybe the goal IS the failure

  with_value_elicitation:
    description: "ARAW Search applies to intrinsic goals too"
    flow: |
      Claim: "My intrinsic goal is Freedom"
      ASSUME RIGHT: Freedom is the terminus → plan for freedom
      ASSUME WRONG: Freedom might not be the real terminus
        → Did value elicitation go deep enough?
        → Are there conflicting intrinsic goals?
        → Is "freedom" actually serving something else?
