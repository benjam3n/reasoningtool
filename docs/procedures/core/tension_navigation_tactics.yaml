description: |
  While value_conflict_decomposition provides the framework for understanding conflicts,
  this procedure provides specific, tested tactics for navigating the most common tensions.

  These are not abstract strategies - they are concrete actions that have worked.

when_to_use:
  - After identifying a value conflict
  - When you need specific tactics, not just frameworks
  - When the abstract strategies feel too vague

# SECURITY VS ACHIEVEMENT
# ============================================

security_vs_achievement:
  description: |
    Security: Stability, predictability, risk avoidance, preservation
    Achievement: Growth, challenge, risk-taking, transformation

  tactics:

    runway_model:
      name: "Build Runway, Then Take Off"
      description: |
        Build explicit security buffer (time, money, options), then take risks
        within the buffer. The buffer defines how much risk you can take.
      implementation:
        - "Calculate minimum security requirement (e.g., 6 months expenses)"
        - "Build to 1.5x minimum before taking major risks"
        - "Define risk budget: What you can lose and still be secure"
        - "Take risks only up to the risk budget"
        - "Rebuild buffer if it drops below 1x minimum"
      success_criteria: "Risk-taking happens AND security is maintained"
      example: |
        Save $30K (6 months buffer) before leaving job.
        Can afford to fail for 6 months. Take risks accordingly.

    reversible_risks:
      name: "Reversible Risks First"
      description: |
        Prioritize risks that can be undone if they fail.
        Security comes from reversibility, not from avoiding risk.
      implementation:
        - "For each risk, ask: Can this be reversed? At what cost?"
        - "Take reversible risks with high upside first"
        - "Reserve irreversible risks for high-confidence situations"
        - "Design exit paths before entering risky situations"
      success_criteria: "Taking risks that don't permanently compromise security"
      example: |
        Start side project (reversible) before quitting job (less reversible).
        Test idea with minimum commitment before betting everything.

    barbell_approach:
      name: "Barbell: Extreme Safety + Extreme Risk"
      description: |
        Don't optimize for moderate risk/moderate return.
        Be extremely safe with most resources, extremely risky with a small portion.
      implementation:
        - "Allocate 80-90% to safe, stable, secure positions"
        - "Allocate 10-20% to high-risk, high-reward positions"
        - "Never risk the 80-90% portion"
        - "Be willing to lose the 10-20% entirely"
      success_criteria: "Secure core is never threatened, but upside capture is possible"
      example: |
        Stable job (80%) + speculative investments (20%)
        Reliable income (90%) + experimental projects (10%)

    staged_commitment:
      name: "Staged Commitment"
      description: |
        Don't commit all at once. Stage commitment with checkpoints.
        Each stage provides information before more commitment.
      implementation:
        - "Define commitment stages (e.g., research, prototype, pilot, full)"
        - "Define go/no-go criteria for each stage"
        - "Commit minimum resources for each stage"
        - "Increase commitment only when previous stage succeeds"
      success_criteria: "Large risks broken into smaller validated steps"
      example: |
        Business: Research (1 week) → Landing page (1 week) → MVP (1 month) → Full launch
        Each stage has exit criteria before next commitment.

# FREEDOM VS SECURITY
# ============================================

freedom_vs_security:
  description: |
    Freedom: Options, autonomy, independence, flexibility
    Security: Stability, predictability, structure, safety

  tactics:

    freedom_through_security:
      name: "Freedom Through Security"
      description: |
        Build security that enables freedom, not security that constrains it.
        The right kind of security is a platform for freedom.
      implementation:
        - "Ask: What security would make me MORE free, not less?"
        - "Build that security first"
        - "Avoid security that comes with freedom-limiting conditions"
        - "Design security that has exit options"
      success_criteria: "Security that expands rather than contracts options"
      example: |
        Financial runway = freedom to say no to bad opportunities
        Reputation/skills = freedom to change directions
        Avoid: Golden handcuffs, non-compete agreements, heavy mortgages

    option_portfolio:
      name: "Option Portfolio"
      description: |
        Instead of one big commitment, maintain portfolio of smaller options.
        Security comes from diversification, not from any single commitment.
      implementation:
        - "List all options currently available"
        - "Identify which options would be lost by any commitment"
        - "Prefer commitments that preserve other options"
        - "Actively maintain 3+ viable paths"
      success_criteria: "Never down to one option; always have alternatives"
      example: |
        Keep 3 income streams viable, even if one is primary
        Maintain skills in 2+ areas, even if one is current focus
        Preserve key relationships that represent different paths

    structured_flexibility:
      name: "Structured Flexibility"
      description: |
        Create structure that defines WHEN to be flexible, not IF.
        Structure and flexibility at different levels.
      implementation:
        - "Create long-term commitments (direction)"
        - "Create short-term flexibility (tactics)"
        - "Define explicit review points when direction can change"
        - "Between review points, commit fully"
      success_criteria: "Commitment when appropriate, flexibility when appropriate"
      example: |
        Commit to career direction for 2 years (security)
        But choose projects quarterly based on what's interesting (freedom)
        Explicit 2-year review point to reconsider direction

    exit_clauses:
      name: "Exit Clauses in All Commitments"
      description: |
        Make commitments with explicit exit conditions.
        Security of knowing you can leave + freedom to leave if needed.
      implementation:
        - "For every commitment, define exit criteria"
        - "Define the cost of exit (make it acceptable)"
        - "Never enter commitments without exit understanding"
        - "Review exits periodically - are they still viable?"
      success_criteria: "All commitments have known exit paths"
      example: |
        Employment: Know what severance/notice period is
        Lease: Know early termination terms
        Projects: Define "kill criteria" before starting

# ============================================
# INDIVIDUAL VS RELATIONAL
# ============================================

individual_vs_relational:
  description: |
    Individual: Personal development, autonomy, self-expression, boundaries
    Relational: Connection, belonging, contribution, interdependence

  tactics:

    explicit_boundaries:
      name: "Explicit Boundaries Enable Connection"
      description: |
        Clear boundaries make deeper connection possible.
        Without boundaries, connection becomes resentment.
      implementation:
        - "Define what you need for yourself (non-negotiable)"
        - "Communicate boundaries clearly, not as rejection"
        - "Honor your boundaries consistently"
        - "Boundaries enable more generous giving when present"
      success_criteria: "Relationships where both individual needs and connection exist"
      example: |
        "I need 2 hours alone each morning" - communicated clearly
        This enables full presence during together time
        Partners respect boundary; don't take it as rejection

    rhythmic_alternation:
      name: "Rhythmic Alternation"
      description: |
        Alternate between individual and relational focus.
        Both get full attention at different times.
      implementation:
        - "Define individual time blocks (sacred, protected)"
        - "Define relational time blocks (fully present)"
        - "Make rhythm explicit and shared"
        - "Don't blend - be fully in one mode or the other"
      success_criteria: "Neither loneliness nor depletion"
      example: |
        Mornings: Individual work (alone, focused)
        Evenings: Relational (family, friends, fully present)
        Weekly: One full day alone, one full day social

    selective_depth:
      name: "Selective Depth Over Broad Coverage"
      description: |
        Fewer deep relationships rather than many shallow ones.
        Deep relationships can honor both individual and relational needs.
      implementation:
        - "Identify 3-5 relationships that matter most"
        - "Invest deeply in these; less in others"
        - "Deep relationships can hold your individuality"
        - "Shallow relationships often demand conformity"
      success_criteria: "Deep connections that don't require hiding yourself"
      example: |
        3 close friends who know you fully, rather than 30 acquaintances
        These friends support your individual path
        Less time maintaining surface relationships

    parallel_presence:
      name: "Parallel Presence"
      description: |
        Be individual AND relational simultaneously.
        Connection doesn't require interaction.
      implementation:
        - "Find activities where both can happen (parallel play)"
        - "Being in same space while doing individual things"
        - "Shared context without demanding attention"
        - "Companionship without conversation"
      success_criteria: "Connected without depleted; alone without lonely"
      example: |
        Both working in same room on different projects
        Shared meals followed by individual activities
        Travel together with individual exploration time

# ============================================
# MEANING VS PLEASURE
# ============================================

meaning_vs_pleasure:
  description: |
    Meaning: Purpose, contribution, significance, legacy
    Pleasure: Enjoyment, comfort, satisfaction, ease

  tactics:

    craft_orientation:
      name: "Craft Orientation: Pleasure IN Meaning"
      description: |
        Find the pleasure that exists within meaningful work.
        Mastery, flow, and craft satisfaction are pleasurable.
      implementation:
        - "Identify the craft elements in meaningful work"
        - "Develop skills until flow states are common"
        - "Appreciate the satisfaction of quality work"
        - "Meaning work done well IS pleasurable"
      success_criteria: "Meaningful work that is also enjoyable"
      example: |
        Writing: The craft of a good sentence (pleasurable)
        Teaching: The moment of student understanding (pleasurable)
        Building: The elegance of a good solution (pleasurable)

    recovery_rituals:
      name: "Recovery Rituals"
      description: |
        Build explicit pleasure/recovery into meaningful work rhythm.
        Meaning work is sustainable when recovery is built in.
      implementation:
        - "Define recovery activities (pure pleasure, no meaning required)"
        - "Schedule recovery as non-negotiable"
        - "No guilt during recovery - it enables meaning work"
        - "Recovery ratio: 1:4 to 1:7 (recovery:work)"
      success_criteria: "Sustainable meaningful work without burnout"
      example: |
        4 hours meaningful work → 1 hour pure pleasure
        Daily: Small pleasures built into routine
        Weekly: Full recovery time (no meaning pressure)

    meaning_in_pleasure:
      name: "Meaning IN Pleasure"
      description: |
        Find meaning in pleasure activities themselves.
        Relationships, appreciation, presence are meaningful.
      implementation:
        - "Reframe pleasure as relational (shared enjoyment)"
        - "Reframe pleasure as gratitude (appreciation)"
        - "Reframe pleasure as presence (being alive)"
        - "Pleasure itself can serve meaning goals"
      success_criteria: "Pleasure that doesn't feel empty"
      example: |
        Dinner with friends: Pleasure + connection + gratitude
        Walk in nature: Pleasure + presence + appreciation
        Entertainment: Pleasure + shared experience + bonding

    minimum_viable_meaning:
      name: "Minimum Viable Meaning"
      description: |
        Not all meaningful work needs to be world-changing.
        Small meanings add up; don't need maximum meaning all the time.
      implementation:
        - "Define minimum meaning threshold (small contributions count)"
        - "Accept that some work is just pleasant, not meaningful"
        - "Don't burden every activity with meaning requirement"
        - "Some meaning + some pleasure = sustainable life"
      success_criteria: "Meaning without meaning-pressure"
      example: |
        Not every project needs to change the world
        Being kind to one person = sufficient meaning
        Some days are just for living, not meaning

# ============================================
# PROCESS VS OUTCOME
# ============================================

process_vs_outcome:
  description: |
    Outcome: Results, achievement, completion, success
    Process: Experience, journey, growth, presence

  tactics:

    process_goals:
      name: "Process Goals (Not Just Outcome Goals)"
      description: |
        Define success in process terms, not just outcome terms.
        "Did I work well?" not just "Did I win?"
      implementation:
        - "For each outcome goal, define parallel process goal"
        - "Process goal: What quality of work/experience do you want?"
        - "Measure both outcome AND process"
        - "Celebrate process success even when outcome fails"
      success_criteria: "Can feel successful regardless of outcome"
      example: |
        Outcome: Win the contract
        Process: Give best presentation I'm capable of
        Both measured; process success is real success

    outcome_checkpoints:
      name: "Outcome Checkpoints, Process Between"
      description: |
        Define outcome checkpoints, but focus on process between them.
        Outcome focus at specific moments; process focus rest of time.
      implementation:
        - "Define explicit outcome review points (weekly, monthly)"
        - "Between checkpoints, focus entirely on process"
        - "At checkpoints, assess outcomes and adjust"
        - "Don't let outcome anxiety invade process time"
      success_criteria: "Outcomes tracked without process-destroying anxiety"
      example: |
        Weekly review: Check outcomes, adjust as needed
        Daily work: Pure process focus, quality work
        Don't check metrics mid-day (outcome anxiety)

    process_design:
      name: "Design Process for Its Own Sake"
      description: |
        Design the process to be worth doing regardless of outcome.
        If the journey itself is valuable, outcome pressure decreases.
      implementation:
        - "Ask: Would I do this even if the outcome failed?"
        - "Design process to be enjoyable/meaningful"
        - "Include learning that's valuable regardless of outcome"
        - "Process is the certain payoff; outcome is the uncertain bonus"
      success_criteria: "Process that's worth doing whether or not outcome succeeds"
      example: |
        Writing book: Learning from research is valuable (process win)
        Even if book fails, the learning remains
        Starting business: Skills developed are valuable even if business fails

# ============================================
# KNOWN VS UNKNOWN
# ============================================

known_vs_unknown:
  description: |
    Known: Expertise, mastery, competence, reliability
    Unknown: Exploration, discovery, novelty, learning

  tactics:

    t_shape:
      name: "T-Shaped Competence"
      description: |
        Deep expertise in one area, broad exploration in many.
        The deep area gives security; the breadth gives freedom.
      implementation:
        - "Identify your vertical (deep expertise area)"
        - "Maintain deep competence in vertical (known)"
        - "Explore broadly in other areas (unknown)"
        - "Breadth informs depth; depth funds breadth"
      success_criteria: "Expert in something, curious about everything"
      example: |
        Deep: Software engineering (mastery, security)
        Broad: Psychology, economics, design, writing (exploration)
        The broad areas inform the deep area

    exploration_budget:
      name: "Exploration Budget"
      description: |
        Explicit allocation for exploration (time, money, energy).
        Exploration is budgeted, not squeezed out by exploitation.
      implementation:
        - "Allocate 10-20% of resources to exploration"
        - "Exploration budget is protected, not discretionary"
        - "Track exploration separately from production"
        - "Exploration doesn't need to justify itself in production terms"
      success_criteria: "Regular exploration that doesn't threaten known mastery"
      example: |
        10% time for learning new things (Google's 20% time)
        One new skill per quarter, regardless of utility
        Exploration budget spent without guilt

    serial_mastery:
      name: "Serial Mastery"
      description: |
        Master one thing, then move to next.
        Known and unknown are sequenced, not simultaneous.
      implementation:
        - "Define mastery threshold (when is area 'known'?)"
        - "Focus until threshold is met"
        - "Then move to next area"
        - "Preserve mastery through periodic practice"
      success_criteria: "Multiple areas of depth over time"
      example: |
        Year 1-3: Master programming
        Year 4-6: Master product design
        Year 7-9: Master business strategy
        Each builds on previous; none is abandoned

# ============================================
# HOW TO USE
# ============================================

usage:
  step_1: "Identify the tension from value_conflict_decomposition"
  step_2: "Find the relevant tension section above"
  step_3: "Review tactics - which resonates with your situation?"
  step_4: "Implement selected tactic with specific details"
  step_5: "Monitor: Is the tactic working? Adjust or try different tactic."

selection_criteria:
  - "Which tactic matches your current resources?"
  - "Which tactic addresses your specific manifestation of the tension?"
  - "Which tactic have you not tried before?"
  - "Which tactic do you resist? (Sometimes that's the one to try)"

combination: |
  Tactics can combine. You might use:
  - runway_model (Security vs Achievement) AND
  - option_portfolio (Freedom vs Security) AND
  - rhythmic_alternation (Individual vs Relational)

  The combinations should be coherent, not contradictory.
