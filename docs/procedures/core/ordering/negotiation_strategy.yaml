description: |
  Orderings for strategic interactions, negotiations, and situations
  where the sequence of actions affects others' responses. Use when
  dealing with counterparties or optimizing trade-offs.

when_to_consider: |
  - Negotiation or competitive contexts
  - Need to shape how others respond
  - Trade-offs where giving up something
  - Iterative work with decreasing returns
  - When observation before action is valuable

variations:

  # ----------------------------------------
  # COMMITMENT-FIRST ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  commitment_first:
    id: commitment_first_ordering
    name: "Commitment-First Ordering (Stackelberg)"
    category: negotiation_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Make strategic commitments early to shape others' responses.
      From game theory: the first mover in a sequential game can
      gain advantage by committing, forcing followers to adapt.
      Sometimes you WANT irreversibility to create leverage.

    different_from_reversibility: |
      Reversibility ordering says: "do reversible things first."
      Commitment ordering says: "sometimes do irreversible things
      first to create strategic advantage." The right choice depends
      on whether you're optimizing for optionality or leverage.

    when_to_use:
      - Negotiation or competitive contexts
      - Need to establish position before others
      - Want to shape how others respond
      - Credible commitment creates advantage
      - Moving first prevents others from preempting

    prioritization_rules:
      1_commitment_value:
        rule: "Identify actions that create binding commitments"
        reason: "Commitments shape follower responses"

      2_first_mover_analysis:
        rule: "Assess first-mover advantage vs disadvantage"
        reason: "Not all moves benefit from going first"
        questions:
          - "Does moving first constrain others favorably?"
          - "Can the commitment be credibly enforced?"
          - "Is the commitment observable to others?"

      3_credibility:
        rule: "Commitments must be credible to be effective"
        reason: "Empty threats don't shape behavior"

      4_sequential_ordering:
        rule: "Order moves to maximize strategic leverage"
        reason: "Each move sets context for next"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Committing without strategic purpose"
      - "Making commitments that aren't credible"
      - "Waiting when first-mover advantage exists"
      - "Committing in ways that can be ignored"

    example:
      context: "Negotiating a contract"
      tasks:
        - "Send initial offer"
        - "Research market rates"
        - "Prepare alternatives (BATNA)"
        - "Set public deadline"
        - "Make final proposal"
      commitment_order:
        1: "Research market rates (information)"
        2: "Prepare alternatives (strengthen position)"
        3: "Set public deadline (credible commitment)"
        4: "Send initial offer (anchoring move)"
        5: "Make final proposal (after observing response)"
      rationale: "Public deadline commits you but also pressures counterparty"

  # CONCESSION-PATTERNED ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  concession_patterned:
    id: concession_patterned_ordering
    name: "Concession-Patterned Ordering"
    category: negotiation_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Sequence concessions to shape the negotiation trajectory.
      From negotiation theory: the pattern of concessions affects
      counterpart expectations. Start with larger concessions that
      get progressively smaller, signaling approach to bottom line.
      Never make unilateral concessions without getting something back.

    when_to_use:
      - Multi-round negotiations
      - Need to signal flexibility while protecting interests
      - Want to shape counterpart expectations
      - Building toward agreement through give-and-take

    key_concepts:
      concession_curve: "Pattern of decreasing concession sizes"
      reciprocity: "Expecting concession in return for concession"
      anchoring: "First offer sets expectations for negotiation range"
      signaling: "Concession pattern communicates reservation price"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_anchor_first:
        rule: "Make ambitious first offer (anchor)"
        reason: "Sets frame for entire negotiation"
        caution: "Not so extreme as to lose credibility"

      2_decreasing_concessions:
        rule: "Each concession smaller than the last"
        pattern: "Large, medium, small, smaller"
        reason: "Signals approaching limit, creates urgency"

      3_require_reciprocity:
        rule: "Don't concede without getting concession in return"
        reason: "Unilateral concessions signal weakness"
        exception: "Small goodwill gestures to build relationship"

      4_save_easy_concessions:
        rule: "Hold back concessions that are cheap for you but valuable to them"
        reason: "Easy concessions are trading chips for late-stage deadlock"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Conceding without reciprocity"
      - "Constant concession size (no urgency signal)"
      - "Giving best offer first (nowhere to go)"
      - "Too many concessions (seems dishonest about true bottom)"

    example:
      context: "Salary negotiation"
      anchoring: "Request $150K (ambitious but credible)"
      concession_pattern:
        round_1: "$150K -> $140K (-$10K, large concession)"
        round_2: "$140K -> $135K (-$5K, medium concession)"
        round_3: "$135K -> $133K (-$2K, small concession)"
        round_4: "$133K -> $132K (-$1K, tiny concession - near limit)"
        signal: "Pattern shows approaching bottom, creates pressure to close"
      reciprocity: "Each salary drop tied to benefit gained (equity, flexibility)"
      rationale: "Counterpart sees convergence, knows to close or lose deal"

  # INFORMATION-POSITION ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  information_position:
    id: information_position_ordering
    name: "Information-Position Ordering (Scout Before Strike)"
    category: negotiation_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Gather information before making irreversible moves. Like a
      chess principle: develop your pieces and understand the position
      before launching an attack. Poor early moves made in ignorance
      create lasting disadvantages. Invest in position before action.

    when_to_use:
      - Strategic decisions with lasting consequences
      - Information asymmetry exists
      - Can afford time to gather intelligence
      - Reversing course would be costly

    key_concepts:
      position: "Strategic advantage from information and placement"
      development: "Building capabilities before commitment"
      intelligence: "Information about counterpart, market, situation"
      premature_commitment: "Acting before position is strong"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_scout:
        rule: "Information-gathering moves before commitment moves"
        reason: "Better information -> better decisions"
        examples: "Research, questions, trial offers, prototypes"

      2_develop:
        rule: "Build capabilities before needing them"
        reason: "Options require preparation"
        examples: "Train skills, build relationships, prepare alternatives"

      3_position:
        rule: "Get into favorable position before engaging"
        reason: "Position advantage compounds"
        examples: "Secure resources, establish credibility, create leverage"

      4_strike:
        rule: "Commit only when position is strong"
        reason: "Information + position = high-quality decisions"
        examples: "Make the pitch, close the deal, launch the product"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Acting before understanding situation"
      - "Committing before developing options"
      - "Skipping information phase under time pressure"
      - "All scouting, no striking (analysis paralysis)"

    example:
      context: "Entering a new market"
      scout_phase:
        - "Research customer needs and pain points"
        - "Map competitor landscape"
        - "Interview potential customers"
        - "Test pricing sensitivity"
      develop_phase:
        - "Build prototype"
        - "Establish key relationships"
        - "Prepare go-to-market materials"
      position_phase:
        - "Secure early customers"
        - "Get testimonials and case studies"
        - "Build credibility through content"
      strike_phase:
        - "Full launch with confidence"
        - "Scale marketing spend"
        - "Aggressive customer acquisition"
      rationale: "Position built on information enables confident action"

  # DIMINISHING-RETURNS AWARE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  diminishing_returns:
    id: diminishing_returns_ordering
    name: "Diminishing-Returns Aware Ordering"
    category: negotiation_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Know when to stop or switch before returns decline below
      opportunity cost. From optimal foraging theory: leave a "patch"
      when the marginal return drops below the average return of
      switching to a new patch. Prevents over-investment in declining
      activities.

    when_to_use:
      - Iterative improvement work (optimization, polishing)
      - Research with decreasing discoveries
      - Any activity with diminishing marginal returns
      - When opportunity cost of continuing is high
      - Multiple "patches" to explore

    prioritization_rules:
      1_marginal_value_check:
        rule: "Monitor marginal return of current activity"
        reason: "Detect when returns are declining"
        formula: "Continue while marginal_return > average_return_of_switching"

      2_switch_threshold:
        rule: "Define threshold for switching activities"
        reason: "Prevents over-exploitation"
        examples:
          - "Stop optimizing when gains < 1% per iteration"
          - "Stop researching when last 3 sources added nothing"
          - "Stop debugging when cost exceeds rewrite cost"

      3_patch_quality:
        rule: "Estimate quality of alternative activities"
        reason: "Switching cost must be worth it"

      4_sunk_cost_immunity:
        rule: "Ignore sunk costs when deciding to switch"
        reason: "Past investment doesn't affect future returns"

    signals_to_switch:
      - "Last few iterations produced minimal improvement"
      - "Effort required is increasing while gains decrease"
      - "Other activities have higher expected return"
      - "You're in maintenance mode, not growth mode"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Polishing endlessly (perfectionism)"
      - "Abandoning too early (impatience)"
      - "Ignoring opportunity cost of continuing"
      - "Sunk cost fallacy ('already invested so much')"

    example:
      context: "Researching a topic"
      activities:
        A: "Reading papers in domain X"
        B: "Reading papers in domain Y"
        C: "Talking to experts"
      diminishing_returns_approach:
        - "Start with domain X (most promising)"
        - "After 5 papers: 3 new insights"
        - "After 10 papers: 1 new insight"
        - "After 12 papers: 0 new insights - SWITCH"
        - "Switch to domain Y or expert interviews"
      rationale: "Don't read paper 13-20 in X when returns have dropped"
