  # TENSION-ARC ORDERING

  tension_arc:
    id: tension_arc_ordering
    name: "Tension-Arc Ordering (Narrative Structure)"
    category: communication_narrative

    philosophy: |
      Structure work to build toward a climax, then resolve.
      From storytelling: setup establishes context, rising action
      builds stakes, climax is the peak moment, resolution ties
      up loose ends. Good for presentations, persuasion, and any
      work with an audience.

    when_to_use:
      - Presentations or pitches
      - User experiences with a journey
      - Persuasive writing or communication
      - Any work that needs to engage and satisfy an audience
      - Project narratives for stakeholders

    three_act_structure:
      act_1_setup:
        purpose: "Establish context, characters, stakes"
        proportion: "~25% of total"
        tasks: "Background, problem definition, why it matters"

      act_2_rising_action:
        purpose: "Build tension, escalate stakes, complications"
        proportion: "~50% of total"
        tasks: "Main work, challenges, progression, obstacles overcome"

      act_3_resolution:
        purpose: "Climax and resolution, payoff"
        proportion: "~25% of total"
        tasks: "Key reveal, solution, conclusion, call to action"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_setup_first:
        rule: "Establish context before diving into details"
        reason: "Audience needs orientation before engagement"

      2_escalate_progressively:
        rule: "Each step should raise stakes higher"
        reason: "Maintains engagement, builds toward climax"

      3_save_best_for_climax:
        rule: "Most impactful content at the ~75% mark"
        reason: "Peak tension before resolution"

      4_resolve_cleanly:
        rule: "Don't end abruptly; provide closure"
        reason: "Satisfying conclusion cements the experience"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Burying the lead (climax too late)"
      - "Front-loading all good content (anticlimactic)"
      - "No setup (audience confused)"
      - "No resolution (unsatisfying)"

    example:
      context: "Product demo presentation"
      tension_arc_order:
        setup:
          - "Establish the problem users face"
          - "Show the pain points and stakes"
        rising_action:
          - "Introduce solution concept"
          - "Show basic functionality"
          - "Add complexity and capability"
          - "Demonstrate edge case handling"
        climax:
          - "Show the 'wow' feature"
          - "Reveal unexpected capability"
        resolution:
          - "Summarize benefits"
          - "Call to action"
          - "Q&A"
      rationale: "Audience engagement peaks at climax, leaves satisfied"

  # INVERTED-PYRAMID ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  inverted_pyramid:
    id: inverted_pyramid_ordering
    name: "Inverted-Pyramid Ordering (Journalism)"
    category: communication_narrative

    philosophy: |
      Most important information first, details in descending order.
      From journalism: assume readers might stop at any point. Lead
      with the conclusion, then supporting facts, then background.
      If truncated, the most important content survives.

    when_to_use:
      - Executive communication
      - Reports that might be skimmed
      - Breaking news or urgent updates
      - Documentation with varied reader depth
      - Anything that might be truncated

    structure:
      lead:
        content: "Most important facts - who, what, when, where, why"
        proportion: "First paragraph or section"
        rule: "Could stand alone as complete communication"

      body:
        content: "Supporting details in decreasing importance"
        proportion: "Middle sections"
        rule: "Each section less critical than previous"

      tail:
        content: "Background, context, nice-to-have details"
        proportion: "Final sections"
        rule: "Can be cut without losing key message"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_conclusion_first:
        rule: "Lead with the answer, recommendation, or news"
        reason: "Busy readers get value immediately"
        anti_pattern: "Building up to the point"

      2_descending_importance:
        rule: "Each subsequent item less important than previous"
        reason: "Truncation at any point preserves most value"
        test: "If I stop here, have I got the key message?"

      3_self_contained_sections:
        rule: "Each section should make sense without later sections"
        reason: "Readers skip around; sections must stand alone"

      4_background_last:
        rule: "Context and history at the end"
        reason: "Only interested readers go that deep"

    comparison_to_tension_arc:
      tension_arc: "Builds to climax - for engaged audiences"
      inverted_pyramid: "Leads with climax - for busy/scanning readers"
      choice: "Depends on audience attention commitment"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Building up to the main point"
      - "Saving the conclusion for last"
      - "Equal treatment of all details"
      - "Critical information in the middle"

    example:
      context: "Status update email"
      inverted_pyramid_order:
        lead: "Project is on track for March 15 launch. One risk: API dependency."
        body:
          - "Development 90% complete, testing begins next week"
          - "API partner confirmed timeline, but integration not yet tested"
          - "Marketing assets ready, pending final product screenshots"
        tail:
          - "Budget utilization at 78%"
          - "Team morale high after successful sprint"
          - "Historical context: this is 2 weeks ahead of last year's timeline"
      truncation_test:
        just_lead: "Reader knows project status and key risk"
        lead_plus_body: "Reader understands details of each area"
        full_email: "Reader has complete context"
      rationale: "Executive reads first line, knows what matters"
