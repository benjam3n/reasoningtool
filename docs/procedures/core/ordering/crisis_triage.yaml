description: |
  Orderings for resource-constrained emergency situations where
  not everything can be addressed. Use when you must maximize
  positive outcomes with limited resources, accepting some losses.

when_to_consider: |
  - Resource-constrained crisis situations
  - Multiple urgent competing demands
  - Some items cannot be saved regardless of effort
  - Need to maximize overall positive outcomes
  - Must make hard prioritization decisions

    philosophy: |
      Prioritize based on severity AND treatability. From medical triage
      (START algorithm): not just "who needs help most" but "who will
      benefit most from help now." Maximize positive outcomes given
      limited resources. Sometimes the most critical case isn't the
      best use of resources.

    when_to_use:
      - Resource-constrained situations
      - Multiple urgent competing demands
      - Some items can't be saved regardless of effort
      - Need to maximize overall positive outcomes
      - Crisis or emergency contexts

    prioritization_rules:
      1_triage_categories:
        rule: "Sort into categories by severity and treatability"
        categories:
          immediate: "Critical, will benefit from immediate attention"
          delayed: "Serious but can wait without deterioration"
          minor: "Can handle themselves or wait longest"
          expectant: "Too far gone to save with available resources"

      2_immediate_first:
        rule: "Address 'immediate' category first"
        reason: "Highest impact per unit of resource"

      3_skip_expectant:
        rule: "Don't spend resources on unsalvageable items"
        reason: "Opportunity cost - others can be saved"
        hard_truth: "Sometimes you must let things fail to save others"

      4_reassess_continuously:
        rule: "Conditions change; re-triage periodically"
        reason: "Delayed can become immediate; immediate can become expectant"

    triage_framework:
      immediate_red:
        criteria: "Life-threatening but treatable with available resources"
        action: "Address immediately"
        examples: "Severe but fixable bugs, critical customer issues with solution"

      delayed_yellow:
        criteria: "Serious but stable for now"
        action: "Address after immediate cases cleared"
        examples: "Important issues that won't get worse in short term"

      minor_green:
        criteria: "Not urgent, can self-resolve or wait indefinitely"
        action: "Defer or delegate"
        examples: "Nice-to-haves, minor inconveniences"

      expectant_black:
        criteria: "Cannot be saved with available resources OR consuming resources won't help"
        action: "Do not allocate resources"
        examples: "Legacy systems requiring full rewrite, issues beyond team capability"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Helping whoever asks first (FIFO in crisis)"
      - "Spending all resources on unsalvageable case"
      - "Ignoring severity because task is 'interesting'"
      - "Static triage without reassessment"
      - "Treating all urgent requests as immediate"

    example:
      context: "Tech debt crisis - multiple critical bugs"
      bugs:
        A: "Payment system down - immediate (will lose revenue now)"
        B: "Minor UI glitch - minor (annoying but functional)"
        C: "Database corruption - delayed (serious but stable for now)"
        D: "Legacy system failing - expectant (too tangled, must rewrite later)"
      triage_order:
        1: "A - Payment system (immediate - highest impact)"
        2: "C - Database (delayed - prevent escalation)"
        3: "B - UI glitch (minor - when bandwidth permits)"
        skip: "D - Legacy system (expectant - don't patch, schedule rewrite)"
      rationale: "Greatest good for greatest number of users"
