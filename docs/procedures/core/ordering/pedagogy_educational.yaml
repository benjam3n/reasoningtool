  Orderings based on learning science research and educational psychology.
  Use when learning, skill-building, or long-term retention is a primary
  goal. These variations optimize for durable understanding rather than
  immediate performance.

when_to_consider: |
  - Learning or skill-building is a primary goal
  - Long-term retention matters more than immediate performance
  - Material has high intrinsic complexity
  - Learners are novices who need scaffolding
  - Teaching hierarchical skills where gaps compound
  - Building intuition before formal understanding
  - Training with eventual autonomous performance
  - Need to counter illusions of competence

  # SPIRAL-CURRICULUM ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  spiral_curriculum:
    id: spiral_curriculum_ordering
    name: "Spiral Curriculum Ordering (Increasing Depth)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Revisit topics at increasing levels of depth and sophistication.
      From Bruner: any subject can be taught at any age in intellectually
      honest form. Start with intuitive understanding, return later with
      more formal treatment. Each spiral reinforces and deepens.

    when_to_use:
      - Complex subjects requiring multiple passes
      - Learners need intuition before formalism
      - Long-term curriculum design
      - Building from concrete to abstract
      - When forgetting is expected between sessions

    prioritization_rules:
      1_start_accessible:
        rule: "First pass should be intuitive and concrete"
        form: "Examples, stories, hands-on experience"

      2_return_with_depth:
        rule: "Subsequent passes add formal structure"
        progression: "Intuition -> Procedure -> Theory -> Generalization"

      3_connect_to_prior:
        rule: "Each spiral explicitly links to previous understanding"
        scaffold: "You learned X; now we see it's part of Y"

      4_increase_abstraction:
        rule: "Later spirals are more abstract and general"
        progression: "Concrete -> Abstract -> Transferable"

    example:
      context: "Teaching multiplication across grades"
      spiral_1_grade_2: "Groups of objects (3 groups of 4 apples)"
      spiral_2_grade_3: "Repeated addition, times tables"
      spiral_3_grade_4: "Multi-digit multiplication, area model"
      spiral_4_grade_5: "Distributive property, algebraic thinking"
      spiral_5_middle: "Abstract algebra concepts"
      each_spiral: "Reinforces prior, adds new depth"

  # MASTERY-LEARNING ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  mastery_learning:
    id: mastery_learning_ordering
    name: "Mastery Learning Ordering (Gate Progress on Competence)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Don't proceed until current material is mastered. From Bloom:
      most students can master material given enough time and appropriate
      instruction. Gate progress on demonstrated competence, not time
      elapsed. Prevents accumulating gaps that compound.

    when_to_use:
      - Skills are strictly hierarchical
      - Gaps in earlier material cause later failure
      - Learner variability in pace
      - High-stakes skill acquisition
      - When proceeding without mastery is costly

    prioritization_rules:
      1_define_mastery:
        rule: "Specify what mastery looks like for each unit"
        criteria: "Observable, measurable competence"
        threshold: "Typically 80-90% performance"

      2_assess_before_proceeding:
        rule: "Verify mastery before moving to next unit"
        method: "Formative assessment, not just completion"

      3_provide_remediation:
        rule: "Those who haven't mastered get additional instruction"
        differentiation: "Different paths to same destination"

      4_allow_variable_time:
        rule: "Time is variable, mastery is constant"
        contrast: "Traditional: time constant, mastery variable"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Moving on despite gaps (compounds problems)"
      - "Assuming completion equals mastery"
      - "Same instruction for all despite different needs"
      - "Punishing slower learners"

    example:
      context: "Learning programming fundamentals"
      mastery_gates:
        unit_1_variables:
          content: "Variables, data types, assignment"
          mastery_threshold: "Can explain and use correctly 90%"
          gate: "Must pass before Unit 2"
        unit_2_control_flow:
          content: "Conditionals, loops"
          requires: "Mastery of Unit 1"
          gate: "Must pass before Unit 3"
        unit_3_functions:
          content: "Functions, parameters, return values"
          requires: "Mastery of Units 1-2"
      remediation: "Struggling students get extra practice, not just repetition"
      result: "All students have solid foundation, no gaps"

  # COGNITIVE-LOAD ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  cognitive_load:
    id: cognitive_load_ordering
    name: "Cognitive Load Ordering (Manage Mental Resources)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Sequence instruction to manage working memory load. From Sweller:
      working memory is limited; intrinsic load depends on element
      interactivity. Reduce extraneous load, manage intrinsic load by
      sequencing from low to high interactivity. Build schemas before
      complex problems.

    when_to_use:
      - Material has high intrinsic complexity
      - Learners are novices (no existing schemas)
      - Want to optimize learning efficiency
      - Complex procedures with many steps
      - Domain has many interacting elements

    three_types_of_load:
      intrinsic:
        source: "Inherent complexity of material"
        factor: "Element interactivity"
        management: "Sequence by complexity, build schemas"

      extraneous:
        source: "Poor instructional design"
        factor: "Unnecessary cognitive processing"
        management: "Eliminate, reduce through better design"

      germane:
        source: "Learning processes"
        factor: "Schema construction and automation"
        management: "Maximize by reducing other loads"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_assess_element_interactivity:
        rule: "Identify how many elements must be processed together"
        low: "Elements can be learned in isolation"
        high: "Elements only make sense together"

      2_start_with_low_interactivity:
        rule: "Begin with isolated elements before combinations"
        method: "Part-task first, then whole-task"

      3_build_schemas:
        rule: "Establish patterns that can be chunked"
        effect: "Reduces load for later complex material"

      4_sequence_by_complexity:
        rule: "Gradually increase element interactivity"
        progression: "Simple -> Intermediate -> Complex"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Starting with complex whole-task"
      - "Combining novel elements (split attention)"
      - "Information overload in early learning"
      - "Ignoring expertise reversal effect"

    example:
      context: "Learning circuit analysis"
      cognitive_load_sequence:
        phase_1_isolated:
          content: "Ohm's law in isolation (V=IR)"
          interactivity: "Low - one relationship"
        phase_2_simple:
          content: "Series circuits (2 resistors)"
          interactivity: "Medium - combine Ohm's law with addition"
        phase_3_complex:
          content: "Series-parallel combinations"
          interactivity: "High - many elements interact"
        phase_4_integrated:
          content: "Complete circuit analysis"
          interactivity: "High - but schemas built"
      rationale: "Each phase builds schemas that reduce load for next"

  # WORKED-EXAMPLES ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  worked_examples:
    id: worked_examples_ordering
    name: "Worked Examples Ordering (Examples Before Practice)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Study worked examples before practicing. From research: for novices,
      studying complete solutions is more effective than problem-solving.
      The worked example effect: examples reduce cognitive load, allowing
      focus on learning domain structure. Fade examples to problems as
      expertise develops.

    when_to_use:
      - Learners are novices in the domain
      - Procedural skills with clear solution steps
      - Want to build schemas efficiently
      - Problem-solving load would overwhelm learning
      - Early skill acquisition

    prioritization_rules:
      1_examples_first:
        rule: "Present complete worked examples before practice"
        reason: "Study reduces cognitive load vs. problem-solving"

      2_multiple_examples:
        rule: "Show several examples with same structure"
        reason: "Supports schema abstraction"

      3_self_explanation:
        rule: "Prompt learners to explain each step"
        reason: "Deepens processing of examples"

      4_fade_gradually:
        rule: "Transition from examples to problems"
        method: "Completion problems, faded scaffolds"

    fading_sequence:
      1_complete_examples: "Full worked solution"
      2_completion_problems: "Some steps missing, fill in"
      3_faded_examples: "Progressively more steps missing"
      4_full_problems: "Independent problem-solving"

    expertise_reversal:
      warning: "Worked examples become harmful for experts"
      reason: "Adds redundant information, increases load"
      solution: "Fade examples as expertise develops"

    example:
      context: "Learning algebra equation solving"
      worked_example_sequence:
        phase_1_study:
          example_1: "Solve: 2x + 3 = 7 (complete solution)"
          example_2: "Solve: 3x - 5 = 10 (complete solution)"
          activity: "Study solutions, explain each step"
        phase_2_completion:
          problem: "Solve: 4x + 2 = 14, Step 1: ____, Step 2: divide..."
          activity: "Fill in missing steps"
        phase_3_faded:
          problem: "Solve: 5x - 3 = 12, Step 1: ____, Step 2: ____"
          activity: "More steps missing"
        phase_4_independent:

  # FADING-SCAFFOLDS ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  fading_scaffolds:
    id: fading_scaffolds_ordering
    name: "Fading Scaffolds Ordering (Gradual Release)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Provide support initially, then gradually remove it. From scaffolding
      theory: give learners support needed to succeed, then transfer
      responsibility as competence grows. "I do, we do, you do" pattern.
      Goal is independent performance.

    when_to_use:
      - Learners need initial support to succeed
      - Goal is autonomous performance
      - Skills can be supported then released
      - Training toward independence
      - When overwhelming initially would cause failure

    gradual_release_model:
      focused_lesson: "Teacher demonstrates, explains thinking"
      guided_instruction: "Teacher-student collaboration"
      collaborative_learning: "Student-student practice"
      independent_practice: "Students work alone"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_maximum_initial_support:
        rule: "Start with scaffolds that ensure success"
        types: "Hints, templates, feedback, guidance"

      2_fade_deliberately:
        rule: "Remove support incrementally as competence grows"
        rate: "Based on performance, not time"

      3_transfer_responsibility:
        rule: "Shift cognitive load to learner progressively"
        from: "Teacher does thinking"
        to: "Student does thinking"

      4_target_independence:
        rule: "End state is performance without scaffolds"
        verify: "Can learner succeed alone?"

    scaffold_types:
      procedural: "Checklists, step-by-step guides"
      conceptual: "Hints, prompts, cues"
      metacognitive: "Self-monitoring questions"
      social: "Collaboration, expert guidance"

    example:

  # INTERLEAVED-PRACTICE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  interleaved_practice:
    id: interleaved_practice_ordering
    name: "Interleaved Practice Ordering (Mixed Practice)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Mix practice of different skills/topics rather than blocking.
      From learning science: blocked practice (AAABBBCCC) feels easier
      but interleaved practice (ABCABCABC) produces better long-term
      learning. Interleaving forces discrimination and strengthens
      retrieval pathways.

    when_to_use:
      - Multiple related skills/topics to learn
      - Long-term retention matters more than immediate performance
      - Want to build discrimination ability
      - Practicing problem categorization
      - Counter-intuitive but research-supported

    blocked_vs_interleaved:
      blocked:
        pattern: "AAABBBCCC"
        feels: "Easier, faster improvement"
        actually: "Less durable learning"
        mechanism: "Repetition priming, not learning"

      interleaved:
        pattern: "ABCABCABC"
        feels: "Harder, slower improvement"
        actually: "Better long-term retention and transfer"
        mechanism: "Forces retrieval, discrimination"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_mix_related_topics:
        rule: "Interleave topics that could be confused"
        reason: "Builds discrimination ability"

      2_accept_difficulty:
        rule: "Expect it to feel harder"
        reason: "Desirable difficulty enhances learning"

      3_space_repetitions:
        rule: "Combine interleaving with spacing"
        effect: "Double benefit"

      4_practice_categorization:
        rule: "Include 'what type of problem is this?'"
        reason: "Real-world requires identifying approach"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Blocking because it feels more productive"
      - "Interleaving unrelated topics (too confusing)"
      - "Switching so fast context never establishes"
      - "Judging learning by immediate performance"

    example:
      context: "Math problem practice"
      blocked_schedule:
        monday: "20 area problems"
        tuesday: "20 volume problems"
        wednesday: "20 perimeter problems"
        immediate_performance: "90% correct"
        week_later_test: "60% correct"
      interleaved_schedule:
        each_day: "Mix of area, volume, perimeter"
        immediate_performance: "75% correct (feels harder)"

  # ----------------------------------------
  spaced_repetition:
    id: spaced_repetition_ordering
    name: "Spaced Repetition Ordering (Expanding Intervals)"
    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Review material at increasing intervals over time. From memory
      research: spacing reviews (distributed practice) beats massing
      (cramming). Optimal interval expands as item is learned - review
      just before forgetting. Minimizes study time while maximizing
      retention.

    when_to_use:
      - Long-term retention is the goal
      - Large amounts of material to memorize
      - Want efficient use of study time
      - Vocabulary, facts, procedures
      - Any recall-based learning

    spacing_effect:
      massed_practice: "Study AAAA in one session"
      spaced_practice: "Study A...A...A...A with gaps"
      result: "Spaced produces much better retention"
      mechanism: "Forgetting + retrieval strengthens memory"

    optimal_interval:
      new_item: "Review soon (1 day)"
      after_success: "Increase interval (2.5x typical)"
      after_failure: "Decrease interval"
      algorithms: "SM-2, FSRS, Leitner system"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_schedule_reviews:
        rule: "Plan when to review each item"
        principle: "Review just before forgetting"

      2_expand_intervals:
        rule: "Successful recall = longer next interval"
        typical: "1 day -> 3 days -> 7 days -> 14 days -> 30 days"

      3_contract_on_failure:
        rule: "Failed recall = shorter next interval"
        effect: "Struggling items get more practice"

      4_prioritize_due_items:
        rule: "Review items at optimal moment"
        metric: "Retrievability - how likely to recall"

    example:
      context: "Learning vocabulary"
      spaced_schedule:
        day_1: "Learn 'ephemeral' - review same day"
        day_2: "Review 'ephemeral' (recalled) - schedule day 4"
        day_4: "Review 'ephemeral' (recalled) - schedule day 11"
        day_11: "Review 'ephemeral' (forgot) - schedule day 13"
        day_13: "Review 'ephemeral' (recalled) - schedule day 20"
      efficiency: "6 reviews over 20 days vs. 20 consecutive reviews"

    category: pedagogy_educational

    philosophy: |
      Introduce conditions that make learning harder but more durable.
      From Bjork: some difficulties improve long-term learning despite
      reducing immediate performance. Desirable difficulties include
      spacing, interleaving, testing, varying conditions. Distinguish
      from undesirable difficulties that just frustrate.

    when_to_use:
      - Long-term retention and transfer are goals
      - Willing to sacrifice immediate performance
      - Want to counter illusions of competence
      - Building robust, flexible knowledge
      - Need learning that transfers to new contexts

    desirable_difficulties:
      spacing: "Distribute practice over time"
      interleaving: "Mix practice of different skills"
      testing: "Practice retrieval, not just re-study"
      variation: "Vary conditions of practice"
      generation: "Generate answers before seeing"
      difficulty: "Appropriate challenge level"

    undesirable_difficulties:
      too_hard: "Material beyond current ability"
      irrelevant: "Difficulty unrelated to learning goal"
      frustrating: "Difficulty that destroys motivation"
      confusing: "Poor explanation, not productive struggle"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_embrace_difficulty:

        rule: "Hard enough to be effortful, not so hard as to fail"
        sweet_spot: "~70-85% success rate"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Choosing easy because it feels more productive"
      - "Judging learning by immediate performance"
      - "Making things hard in unhelpful ways"
      - "Frustrating learners without purpose"

    example:
