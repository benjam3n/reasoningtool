category_name: "Military Strategy Orderings"
description: |
  Orderings derived from military doctrine and strategic principles.
  Use when facing active competition, time pressure, distributed
  execution, or when decisive action at key points is required.

when_to_consider: |
  - Active competitor/adversary will react to your actions
  - Need to act faster than environment changes
  - There is a decisive point where victory makes everything easier
  - Execution will be distributed with local autonomy needed
  - Resources insufficient for all objectives simultaneously
  - Facing multiple separated threats/competitors
  - Risk of overextension or unsustainable commitments
  - Work has distinct preparation, execution, and sustain phases

  # OODA LOOP ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  ooda_loop:
    id: ooda_loop_ordering
    name: "OODA Loop Ordering (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Cycle rapidly through Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loops, faster than
      the environment or adversary can adapt. From John Boyd's fighter
      pilot theory: victory goes to whoever completes decision cycles
      fastest. The Orient phase is critical - it's where mental models
      are updated and mismatches with reality are corrected.

    when_to_use:
      - Competitive or adversarial situations
      - Rapidly changing environments
      - Need to maintain initiative
      - Information is incomplete but time-sensitive

    key_concepts:
      observe: "Gather raw information from environment"
      orient: "Analyze, synthesize, update mental models"
      decide: "Select course of action from alternatives"
      act: "Execute the decision"
      tempo: "Speed of cycling through the loop"

    algorithm:
      continuous_loop:
        - "OBSERVE: Gather current state information"
        - "ORIENT: Update mental model, analyze implications"
        - "DECIDE: Choose next action from options"
        - "ACT: Execute quickly, don't over-plan"
        - "REPEAT: Immediately begin next cycle"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_observe_first:
        rule: "Always start with fresh observation"
        reason: "Acting on stale information leads to poor decisions"

      2_orient_deeply:
        rule: "Invest most effort in orientation/analysis"
        reason: "This is where competitive advantage is built"

      3_decide_quickly:
        rule: "Make good-enough decisions fast"
        reason: "Perfect decisions too late are worthless"

      4_act_immediately:
        rule: "Execute without hesitation once decided"
        reason: "Delay erodes the value of the decision"

      5_maximize_tempo:
        rule: "Complete cycles faster than environment changes"
        reason: "Faster cycles = staying ahead of the situation"

  # SCHWERPUNKT ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  schwerpunkt:
    id: schwerpunkt_ordering
    name: "Schwerpunkt Ordering (Main Effort Focus)"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Identify the decisive point and concentrate overwhelming effort there.
      From German military doctrine: schwerpunkt (focus of effort) is where
      you mass resources to achieve breakthrough. Everything else is secondary
      or economy of force.

    when_to_use:
      - Resources are limited relative to total requirements
      - One area determines overall success or failure
      - Need decisive breakthrough rather than incremental progress
      - Multiple fronts competing for attention

    prioritization_rules:
      1_identify_decisive_point:
        rule: "Find where success would be transformative"
        question: "If we win here, does everything else become easier?"

      2_concentrate_resources:
        rule: "Put 70%+ of effort on schwerpunkt"
        reason: "Superiority at one point beats mediocrity everywhere"

      3_accept_risk_elsewhere:
        rule: "Deliberately under-resource secondary areas"
        reason: "Cannot be strong everywhere - accept trade-offs"

      4_exploit_breakthrough:
        rule: "When schwerpunkt succeeds, pour through the gap"
        reason: "Victory is amplified by rapid exploitation"

  # AUFTRAGSTAKTIK ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  auftragstaktik:
    id: auftragstaktik_ordering
    name: "Auftragstaktik Ordering (Commander's Intent)"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Define the intent and desired end-state, then let executors determine
      how to achieve it. Tell subordinates what to accomplish and why, not
      how. Local decision-makers have better information about their situation.

    when_to_use:
      - Distributed execution with local variability
      - Situation is complex and evolving
      - Central planning can't anticipate all conditions
      - Want to encourage initiative and ownership

    prioritization_rules:
      1_define_intent_first:
        rule: "Clarify end-state before any detailed planning"
        reason: "Intent guides all subsequent decisions"

      2_provide_context:
        rule: "Explain why this intent matters (two levels up)"
        reason: "Enables intelligent adaptation to situations"

      3_specify_boundaries:
        rule: "Define what must NOT happen (constraints)"
        reason: "Freedom within limits, not unlimited freedom"

      4_trust_execution:
        rule: "Don't prescribe methods; judge by results"
        reason: "Local knowledge beats central planning"

  # ----------------------------------------
  # ECONOMY-OF-FORCE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  economy_of_force:
    id: economy_of_force_ordering
    name: "Economy of Force Ordering"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Allocate minimum necessary resources to secondary efforts, preserving
      maximum for the main effort. No part of the force should be left
      without purpose, but not every objective deserves equal resources.

    when_to_use:
      - Resources insufficient for all objectives
      - Must maintain presence in multiple areas
      - Some objectives are clearly more important
      - Need to free resources for concentration elsewhere

    prioritization_rules:
      1_categorize_all_tasks:
        rule: "Every task is main, supporting, holding, or abandon"
        reason: "Can't economize without categorization"

      2_question_holding_tasks:
        rule: "What's the minimum that actually maintains position?"
        trap: "Tendency to over-resource 'just in case'"

      3_supporting_enables_main:
        rule: "Supporting tasks sized to enable, not excel"
        reason: "Supporting excellence doesn't help if main fails"

      4_document_accepted_risk:
        rule: "Explicitly state what might fail due to economy"
        reason: "Conscious risk-taking, not negligent under-resourcing"

  # CONCENTRATION-OF-FORCE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  concentration_of_force:
    id: concentration_of_force_ordering
    name: "Concentration of Force Ordering (Lanchester's Laws)"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Achieve local superiority by concentrating forces at decisive points.
      From Lanchester's Laws: fighting power scales with the square of
      numbers. A 2:1 advantage yields 4:1 effectiveness.

    when_to_use:
      - Competition follows square law dynamics (winner-take-all)
      - Multiple engagement points with choice of where to fight
      - Concentration is physically/logistically possible
      - Can afford to be weak elsewhere

    prioritization_rules:
      1_identify_decisive_points:
        rule: "Find where concentrated effort can achieve breakthrough"
        question: "Where does local victory cascade to overall victory?"

      2_mass_for_superiority:
        rule: "Concentrate until you have clear local advantage"
        ratio: "3:1 often cited as attack success threshold"

      3_sequence_engagements:
        rule: "Fight one battle at a time with concentrated force"
        reason: "Serial concentration beats parallel dilution"

      4_avoid_fair_fights:
        rule: "Never engage without local superiority"
        reason: "Fair fights are expensive; unfair fights are decisive"

  # ----------------------------------------
  # INTERIOR-LINES ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  interior_lines:
    id: interior_lines_ordering
    name: "Interior Lines Ordering"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Operate from a central position to engage dispersed opponents
      sequentially. The central force can mass against one opponent,
      defeat them, then turn to face another before they can combine.

    when_to_use:
      - Multiple opponents/challenges that are separated
      - Central position available between them
      - Can move/respond faster than opponents can combine
      - Sequential engagement is feasible

    prioritization_rules:
      1_secure_central_position:
        rule: "Establish position that enables rapid concentration"
        advantage: "Interior lines = shorter movement to any point"

      2_prevent_combination:
        rule: "Engage before separated opponents can unite"
        danger: "Combined opponents eliminate interior lines advantage"

      3_defeat_weakest_first:
        rule: "Often start with most vulnerable opponent"
        reason: "Quick victory frees resources for next engagement"

      4_maintain_tempo:
        rule: "Move fast enough to prevent recombination"
        reason: "Speed preserves interior lines advantage"

  # ----------------------------------------
  # CULMINATING-POINT ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  culminating_point:
    id: culminating_point_ordering
    name: "Culminating Point Ordering"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Every attack reaches a culminating point where the attacker's strength
      is exhausted. Recognize and stop at the culminating point; don't
      overextend into vulnerability.

    when_to_use:
      - Extended campaigns with finite resources
      - Success creates new vulnerabilities
      - Diminishing returns on continued effort
      - Need to consolidate before advancing further

    prioritization_rules:
      1_track_offensive_strength:
        rule: "Continuously monitor resources and momentum"
        metrics: "Budget burn rate, team energy, technical debt"

      2_anticipate_culmination:
        rule: "Plan for where culmination will occur"
        reason: "Surprised culmination leads to overextension"

      3_recognize_symptoms:
        rule: "Watch for signs of approaching culmination"
        symptoms: ["Slowing progress", "Rising costs", "Team fatigue"]

      4_consolidate_then_resume:
        rule: "Pause, consolidate gains, rebuild strength"
        reason: "Fresh offense beats exhausted advance"

  # ----------------------------------------
  # CENTER-OF-GRAVITY ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  center_of_gravity:
    id: center_of_gravity_ordering
    name: "Center of Gravity Ordering"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Identify and attack the enemy's center of gravity - the source of their
      strength and cohesion. Attacking it directly can collapse the entire
      system. Conversely, protect your own center of gravity.

    when_to_use:
      - Need to understand what to attack or defend
      - Complex system with many components
      - Want maximum effect from limited resources
      - Looking for leverage points

    prioritization_rules:
      1_identify_cog_first:
        rule: "Cannot attack effectively without knowing true COG"
        trap: "Attacking symptoms instead of cause"

      2_trace_critical_chain:
        rule: "COG -> Capabilities -> Requirements -> Vulnerabilities"
        method: "Work backward from observed capabilities"

      3_attack_vulnerabilities:
        rule: "Often can't attack COG directly - attack requirements"
        reason: "Vulnerabilities are accessible weaknesses"

      4_protect_own_cog:
        rule: "Understand and defend your own center of gravity"
        reason: "You're also vulnerable to COG analysis"

  # PHASES-OF-OPERATIONS ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  phases_of_operations:
    id: phases_of_operations_ordering
    name: "Phases of Operations Ordering"
    category: military_strategy

    philosophy: |
      Structure campaigns into distinct phases with different objectives.
      Operations proceed through Shape (set conditions), Decisive (achieve
      objectives), and Sustain (maintain gains) phases.

    when_to_use:
      - Long campaigns with distinct stages
      - Different phases need different approaches
      - Need clear transition criteria
      - Building toward decisive moment

    phase_structure:
      phase_0_shape:
        purpose: "Set conditions for success"
        activities: "Preparation, positioning, resource gathering"

      phase_1_deter_seize_initiative:
        purpose: "Establish position, begin decisive operations"
        activities: "Initial moves, establishing presence"

      phase_2_decisive_operations:
        purpose: "Achieve primary objectives"
        activities: "Main effort, concentrated resources"

      phase_3_stabilize_sustain:
        purpose: "Maintain and consolidate gains"
        activities: "Defense, maintenance, transition"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_complete_shaping:
        rule: "Don't begin decisive phase until conditions set"
        reason: "Premature action wastes resources"

      2_clear_transitions:
        rule: "Define criteria for phase transitions"
        reason: "Know when to shift approach"

      3_phase_appropriate_actions:
        rule: "Different phases require different activities"
        shape: "Reconnaissance, planning, resource prep"
        decisive: "Concentrated execution, risk acceptance"
        sustain: "Consolidation, defense, handoff"

      4_plan_for_sustain:
        rule: "Victory means nothing without sustaining gains"
        trap: "Planning only for decisive phase"
