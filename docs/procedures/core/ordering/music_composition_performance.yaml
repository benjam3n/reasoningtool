  Orderings inspired by musical forms and performance practices.
  Use when content needs narrative structure, thematic development,
  or audience engagement over extended experiences.

when_to_consider: |
  - Content needs introduce-develop-resolve narrative arc
  - Teaching same concept through multiple examples/contexts
  - Multiple voices/perspectives must combine harmoniously
  - Key message needs reinforcement through repetition
  - Work proceeds through dialogic exchange
  - Building toward climactic reveal or announcement
  - Extended experience needs energy management

  # SONATA-FORM ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  sonata_form:
    id: sonata_form_ordering
    name: "Sonata-Form Ordering (Introduce-Develop-Recapitulate)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Structure work in three main sections: exposition (introduce themes),
      development (explore and transform themes), recapitulation (return
      themes with resolution). From classical music: the most influential
      formal structure in Western music, providing dramatic arc through
      thematic development and return.

    when_to_use:
      - Complex content needing clear structure
      - Presentations with multiple ideas to integrate
      - Arguments that need to be developed then resolved
      - Teaching complex concepts
      - Any work benefiting from ABA structure with transformation

    three_sections:
      exposition:
        purpose: "Introduce main themes/ideas"
        content: "Present first theme (home key), transition, second theme (related key)"
        proportion: "~25-30%"
        task: "Establish the key concepts clearly"

      development:
        purpose: "Explore, transform, create tension"
        content: "Fragment themes, modulate through keys, build intensity"
        proportion: "~30-40%"
        task: "Show depth, connections, implications"

      recapitulation:
        purpose: "Return themes with resolution"
        content: "Both themes now in home key, coda for closure"
        proportion: "~25-30%"
        task: "Integrate and conclude with resolution"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_clear_exposition:
        rule: "Establish themes clearly before developing"
        reason: "Development only works if themes are known"

      2_meaningful_development:
        rule: "Development should reveal new aspects"
        examples: "Combine themes, show implications, address objections"

      3_transformed_return:
        rule: "Recapitulation isn't mere repetition"
        change: "Themes return transformed by development"

      4_resolution_in_recap:
        rule: "Tension built in development resolves"
        closure: "Audience feels completion"

    example:
      context: "Technical presentation on system architecture"
      sonata_structure:
        exposition:
          theme_1: "Current system problems (pain points)"
          transition: "Why change is needed"
          theme_2: "Proposed new architecture"
        development:
          explore: "How new architecture addresses each problem"
          transform: "Show edge cases, trade-offs, alternatives considered"
          build: "Evidence, benchmarks, case studies"
        recapitulation:
          theme_1_return: "Problems are now solved"
          theme_2_return: "Architecture proven through development"
          coda: "Call to action, next steps"
      rationale: "Complex topic gets clear structure with dramatic development"

  theme_and_variations:
    id: theme_and_variations_ordering
    name: "Theme-and-Variations Ordering (Same Concept, Multiple Lenses)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Present a theme, then show it through multiple variations.
      From music: state a melody, then repeat with different
      harmonies, rhythms, keys, textures. Each variation reveals
      new aspects while maintaining connection to the theme.
      Excellent for teaching one concept through multiple examples.

    when_to_use:
      - Teaching one concept through multiple examples
      - Showing same idea in different contexts
      - Building deep understanding through repetition with variation
      - Design explorations maintaining core identity
      - When audience needs multiple angles on one idea

    structure:
      theme:
        purpose: "State the core idea clearly"
        character: "Should be memorable and well-defined"
        proportion: "~15-20%"

      variations:
        purpose: "Each explores one aspect"
        variety: "Different angle, context, or application"
        count: "Typically 3-7 variations"
        proportion: "~60-70%"

      finale:
        purpose: "Synthesis or most elaborate variation"
        character: "Often combines elements from variations"
        proportion: "~15-20%"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_clear_theme_first:
        rule: "Theme must be understood before variations"
        test: "Can audience recognize theme in variations?"

      2_progressive_complexity:
        rule: "Variations often increase in complexity"
        pattern: "Simple -> complex -> synthesis"

      3_each_variation_distinct:
        rule: "Each variation should add something new"
        variety: "Different context, example, or perspective"

      4_maintain_thread:
        rule: "Theme should be recognizable throughout"
        connection: "Variations shouldn't lose the original"

    variation_types:
      simplification: "Strip to essence"
      elaboration: "Add complexity and detail"
      recontextualization: "Same idea, different domain"
      inversion: "Flip or negate aspects"
      combination: "Merge with another concept"

    example:
      context: "Teaching recursion in programming"
      theme: "Recursion = function that calls itself"
      variations:
        var_1_simple: "Factorial (simplest example)"
        var_2_tree: "Directory traversal (practical application)"
        var_3_visual: "Fractals (visual intuition)"
        var_4_mutual: "Mutual recursion (variation on structure)"
        var_5_tail: "Tail recursion (optimization angle)"
        var_6_dp: "Memoization (connection to DP)"
      finale: "Design your own recursive solution (synthesis)"
      rationale: "Same concept, multiple angles = deep understanding"

  # FUGUE-CONSTRUCTION ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  fugue_construction:
    id: fugue_construction_ordering
    name: "Fugue-Construction Ordering (Polyphonic Voices)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Introduce voices one at a time, then combine contrapuntally.
      From Baroque music: fugue begins with single subject, each new
      voice enters with the subject while others continue with
      counterpoint. Results in complex texture built from simple
      elements. For integrating multiple perspectives into harmony.

    when_to_use:
      - Multiple independent voices/perspectives to integrate
      - Want cumulative complexity from simple beginnings
      - Team presentations where each person contributes
      - Showing how ideas relate and combine
      - Building complex argument from simple premises

    fugue_sections:
      exposition:
        purpose: "Introduce subject in each voice"
        pattern: "Voice 1 states subject, voice 2 enters with subject while 1 continues"
        result: "All voices established with shared theme"

      development_episodes:
        purpose: "Explore combinations and modulations"
        content: "Voices interact, subject appears in various ways"
        techniques: "Stretto (overlapping entries), inversion, augmentation"

      final_section:
        purpose: "Return to home key, full texture"
        content: "All voices combine, often climactic stretto"
        resolution: "Strong cadence bringing voices together"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_clear_subject:
        rule: "Subject must be distinctive and recognizable"
        test: "Can you identify subject when voices combine?"

      2_successive_entry:
        rule: "Add voices one at a time"
        reason: "Listener tracks each voice separately"

      3_maintain_independence:
        rule: "Each voice has its own melodic interest"
        not: "Simple harmony; true counterpoint"

      4_combine_meaningfully:
        rule: "When voices combine, result is more than sum"
        effect: "New meaning emerges from interaction"

    example:
      context: "Panel discussion on AI ethics"
      fugue_structure:
        subject: "Core ethical principle (autonomy)"
        voice_1_entry: "Technical perspective states principle"
        voice_2_entry: "Legal perspective enters with principle, tech continues"
        voice_3_entry: "Social perspective enters, others continue"
        development: "Perspectives interact, debate, find connections"
        stretto: "Rapid exchange showing how all views relate"
        conclusion: "Integration of all three perspectives"
      rationale: "Complex integration built from simple, clear beginnings"

  # RONDO-FORM ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  rondo_form:
    id: rondo_form_ordering
    name: "Rondo-Form Ordering (Recurring Refrain)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Alternate between recurring main theme and contrasting episodes.
      From music: ABACADA... structure where A always returns.
      Main theme provides anchor and coherence while episodes provide
      variety. Audience always knows where they are because refrain
      returns. Good for reinforcing key message with variety.

    when_to_use:
      - Key message needs reinforcement through repetition
      - Want variety without losing focus
      - Audience needs regular anchor points
      - Extended presentations needing structure
      - When main point should be memorable

    structure:
      refrain_A:
        role: "Main theme that always returns"
        character: "Most important, memorable content"
        returns: "Multiple times throughout"

      episodes_BCD:
        role: "Contrasting sections between refrains"
        variety: "Each episode explores different aspect"
        contrast: "Different from refrain and each other"

    common_patterns:
      simple_rondo: "ABACA"
      sonata_rondo: "ABACABA (with development)"
      extended_rondo: "ABACADAEA..."

    prioritization_rules:
      1_strong_refrain:
        rule: "A section must be memorable and clear"
        reason: "It's the anchor of the whole structure"
        test: "Can audience anticipate/recognize return?"

      2_contrasting_episodes:
        rule: "Each episode should feel different"
        from_refrain: "Clear contrast with A"
        from_each_other: "B, C, D each distinct"

      3_strategic_returns:
        rule: "Refrain returns at key moments"
        effect: "Reinforcement, orientation, satisfaction"

      4_final_refrain:
        rule: "End with refrain (often elaborated)"
        closure: "Return to home provides satisfaction"

    example:
      context: "Product launch presentation"
      rondo_structure:
        A_refrain: "Our product solves X (core value proposition)"
        B_episode: "Customer problem exploration"
        A_return: "Our product solves X (reinforcement)"
        C_episode: "Technical deep-dive"
        A_return: "Our product solves X (different angle)"
        D_episode: "Competitive landscape"
        A_final: "Our product solves X (call to action)"
      audience_experience: "Clear main message reinforced between explorations"
      rationale: "Key message repeated without boring repetition"

  # CALL-AND-RESPONSE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  call_and_response:
    id: call_and_response_ordering
    name: "Call-and-Response Ordering (Dialogic Exchange)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Alternate between statement and response, question and answer.
      From African music, gospel, jazz: one voice calls, another
      responds. Creates dialogue, engagement, and distributed
      authorship. Can be leader-group or two parties. Builds
      energy through exchange.

    when_to_use:
      - Interactive sessions with audience participation
      - Team work proceeding through dialogue
      - Teaching through Socratic questioning
      - Building energy and engagement
      - When distributed contribution is valuable

    patterns:
      leader_group:
        leader: "States the call"
        group: "Responds collectively"
        example: "Preacher/congregation, teacher/class"

      antiphonal:
        group_a: "First group states"
        group_b: "Second group responds"
        example: "Choir sections, team debates"

      solo_trading:
        soloist_a: "First solo statement"
        soloist_b: "Second solo response"
        example: "Jazz solos, point/counterpoint"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_clear_call:
        rule: "Call must invite response"
        types: "Question, incomplete phrase, prompt"

      2_space_for_response:
        rule: "Leave room for response"
        timing: "Don't fill all the space"

      3_response_builds:
        rule: "Response should add to call"
        growth: "Dialogue accumulates meaning"

      4_escalation:
        rule: "Energy often builds through exchanges"
        pattern: "Calls and responses intensify"

    example:
      context: "Workshop facilitation"
      call_and_response_flow:
        call_1: "What problems do you face with X?"
        response_1: "Participants share problems"
        call_2: "How have you tried to solve them?"
        response_2: "Participants share attempts"
        call_3: "What if we tried Y approach?"
        response_3: "Participants react and build"
        call_4: "Let's design a solution together"
        response_4: "Collaborative creation"
      energy: "Engagement builds through dialogue"
      outcome: "Solutions emerge from exchange, not lecture"

  # CRESCENDO-BUILDING ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  crescendo_building:
    id: crescendo_building_ordering
    name: "Crescendo-Building Ordering (Progressive Intensification)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Start soft, build progressively to climax. From music:
      crescendo is gradual increase in volume and intensity.
      Applied to structure: layer in complexity, stakes, or
      revelation progressively. The endpoint is most powerful
      because of the journey to reach it.

    when_to_use:
      - Building toward climactic reveal or announcement
      - Progressive disclosure of information
      - Generating excitement for launch or reveal
      - Persuasion building to conclusion
      - Any content where ending should have maximum impact

    intensity_dimensions:
      volume: "Quiet to loud (literal or metaphorical)"
      complexity: "Simple to complex"
      stakes: "Low to high"
      revelation: "General to specific"
      emotion: "Calm to intense"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_start_restrained:
        rule: "Begin at lower intensity"
        reason: "Room to grow is essential"

      2_consistent_direction:
        rule: "Always building, never retreating"
        allowance: "Small dips for variety, not major drops"

      3_controlled_pace:
        rule: "Build steadily, not too fast"
        trap: "Peaking too early leaves nowhere to go"

      4_climax_payoff:
        rule: "Climax must justify the buildup"
        disappointment: "Weak climax feels like letdown"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Starting at maximum (nowhere to go)"
      - "Climax in the middle (anticlimactic end)"
      - "Building then dropping then building (confusing)"
      - "Build without payoff (frustrating)"

    example:
      context: "Product announcement event"
      crescendo_structure:
        opening_soft: "Thank attendees, set context (low key)"
        first_layer: "Industry trends and challenges (building interest)"
        second_layer: "Hints at what's coming (building anticipation)"
        third_layer: "Customer stories and pain points (building stakes)"
        fourth_layer: "Teaser features (building excitement)"
        fifth_layer: "Core reveal (high intensity)"
        climax: "Main announcement - 'One more thing...' (maximum impact)"
        resolution: "Call to action, availability"
      energy_curve: "Continuously rises to climax"
      effect: "Announcement has maximum emotional impact"

  concert_setlist:
    id: concert_setlist_ordering
    name: "Concert-Setlist Ordering (Performance Arc)"
    category: music_composition_performance

    philosophy: |
      Structure an extended experience for maximum engagement.
      From live music: setlist designs the emotional journey
      through an evening. Opener grabs attention, hits maintain
      energy, breathers allow recovery, encore provides climax.
      Pacing and variety maintain audience engagement over time.

    when_to_use:
      - Extended sessions or events (conferences, workshops)
      - Need to maintain energy over long period
      - Multiple segments of varying intensity
      - Audience stamina is a concern
      - Want designed emotional journey

    setlist_elements:
      opener:
        role: "Grab attention, set tone"
        character: "Strong but not climax"
        purpose: "Audience knows they're in good hands"

      early_hits:
        role: "Build energy, satisfy expectations"
        character: "Known crowd-pleasers"
        timing: "While audience fresh"

      deep_cuts:
        role: "Reward engaged audience"
        character: "Less known, more complex"
        timing: "Middle when attention established"

      breathers:
        role: "Allow recovery"
        character: "Slower, lower intensity"
        timing: "After high-energy sequences"

      closer:
        role: "Big finish before encore"
        character: "Major hit, high energy"
        setup: "For encore to exceed"

      encore:
        role: "Climactic return"
        character: "Best saved for last"
        experience: "Peak of the evening"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_strong_opener:
        rule: "First impression sets expectations"
        not: "Your biggest hit (save that)"
        goal: "Attention captured, trust established"

      2_manage_energy:
        rule: "Vary intensity to prevent fatigue"
        pattern: "High-medium-high-low-high"
        valleys: "Enable higher peaks"

      3_know_your_audience:
        rule: "Balance familiar and new"
        familiar: "Maintains engagement"
        new: "Provides discovery"

      4_close_strong:
        rule: "Last impression matters most"
        build: "Closer and encore are peaks"

    example:
      context: "Day-long conference"
      setlist_structure:
        opener_9am: "Engaging keynote (attention-grabbing)"
        hit_10am: "Popular topic deep-dive (crowd-pleaser)"
