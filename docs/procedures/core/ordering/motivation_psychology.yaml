description: |
  Orderings that account for human psychological factors like energy,
  motivation, habits, and engagement. Essential for human executors
  who need to maintain sustainable performance over time.

when_to_consider: |
  - Human executor (not automated)
  - Low motivation or energy levels
  - Long work sessions requiring pacing
  - Building new habits or routines
  - Need to maintain stakeholder engagement

variations:

  # MOMENTUM ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  momentum:
    id: momentum_ordering
    name: "Momentum Ordering (Quick Wins First)"
    category: motivation_psychology

    philosophy: |
      Start with easy, completable tasks to build momentum and confidence.
      Progress begets progress. Completed tasks provide psychological fuel
      for tackling harder ones. Particularly good for human executors prone
      to procrastination or overwhelm.

    when_to_use:
      - Human executor feeling overwhelmed
      - Need to demonstrate early progress (stakeholder visibility)
      - Low motivation or energy
      - Long project needing sustained engagement

    prioritization_rules:
      1_quick_completables:
        rule: "Tasks that can be finished quickly go first"
        reason: "Build sense of progress and accomplishment"

      2_high_visibility:
        rule: "Tasks with visible outputs go early"
        reason: "Tangible progress maintains motivation"

      3_unblock_easy_chains:
        rule: "Easy tasks that unblock other easy tasks go first"
        reason: "Creates cascade of completions"

      4_defer_big_ambiguous:
        rule: "Large uncertain tasks come after momentum established"
        reason: "Tackle hard things from position of strength"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Starting with the hardest task (leads to paralysis)"
      - "Saving all easy tasks for later (no early wins)"
      - "Deprioritizing visible tasks (lose stakeholder support)"

    example:
      context: "Learning a new programming language"
      steps:
        - "Build a complex project"
        - "Read entire documentation"
        - "Write Hello World"
        - "Complete 5 small tutorials"
        - "Set up development environment"
      momentum_order:
        1: "Set up development environment (quick, necessary)"
        2: "Write Hello World (instant success)"
        3: "Complete 5 small tutorials (building confidence)"
        4: "Read documentation (with context from tutorials)"
        5: "Build complex project (momentum established)"
      rationale: "Build confidence through small wins before tackling complexity"

  # ENERGY-AWARE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  energy_aware:
    id: energy_aware_ordering
    name: "Energy-Aware Ordering"
    category: motivation_psychology

    philosophy: |
      Match task difficulty to executor energy levels. Hard cognitive
      work when fresh, routine work when tired. For human executors,
      this can dramatically improve output quality and reduce burnout.

    when_to_use:
      - Human solo executor
      - Long work sessions
      - Mix of cognitively demanding and routine tasks
      - Preventing burnout on long projects

    prioritization_rules:
      1_hard_when_fresh:
        rule: "Cognitively demanding tasks at start of session"
        reason: "Best cognitive resources for hardest problems"

      2_creative_after_warm_up:
        rule: "Creative tasks after brief warm-up period"
        reason: "Creativity flows after initial engagement"

      3_routine_when_tired:
        rule: "Routine/mechanical tasks late in session"
        reason: "Can execute on autopilot"

      4_breaks_before_complexity:
        rule: "Schedule breaks before returning to hard problems"
        reason: "Restore cognitive resources"

    energy_profiles:
      morning_person:
        - "Hard analytical work: 8am-12pm"
        - "Creative work: 10am-2pm"
        - "Meetings/collaboration: 2pm-4pm"
        - "Routine work: 4pm-6pm"

      evening_person:
        - "Warm-up/routine: morning"
        - "Creative work: afternoon"
        - "Hard analytical: evening"

    example:
      context: "Full day of coding work"
      steps:
        - "Architecture design (hard)"
        - "Code review (medium)"
        - "Fix minor bugs (routine)"
        - "Write documentation (medium)"
        - "Implement complex feature (hard)"
        - "Update dependencies (routine)"
      energy_aware_order:
        1: "Architecture design (fresh morning energy)"
        2: "Implement complex feature (still fresh)"
        3: "Code review (moderate post-lunch)"
        4: "Write documentation (can do somewhat tired)"
        5: "Fix minor bugs (low energy OK)"
        6: "Update dependencies (mechanical, end of day)"
      rationale: "Hard thinking when fresh, routine when depleted"

  # ENERGY-ENVELOPE ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  energy_envelope:
    id: energy_envelope_ordering
    name: "Energy-Envelope Ordering (Setlist Pacing)"
    category: motivation_psychology

    philosophy: |
      Plan energy peaks and valleys; don't exhaust the audience
      or executor. From concert setlist design: sustained high
      energy leads to fatigue. Strategic valleys allow recovery
      for bigger peaks. The goal is maximum total engagement,
      not maximum instantaneous intensity.

    different_from_energy_aware: |
      Energy-aware matches task difficulty to available energy.
      Energy-envelope plans the shape of energy across time.
      Energy-aware is reactive; energy-envelope is proactive design.

    when_to_use:
      - Extended sessions (presentations, workshops, projects)
      - Audience or executor stamina is limited
      - Want to maximize engagement over time
      - Multiple phases with different intensity needs

    key_concepts:
      peak: "High-intensity moment requiring full attention"
      valley: "Lower-intensity recovery period"
      envelope: "The shape of energy across the session"
      climax: "The single highest peak (usually near end)"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_map_energy_requirements:
        rule: "Classify each item as peak, valley, or moderate"
        reason: "Know what you're working with"

      2_design_the_envelope:
        rule: "Plan the shape: opening, build, valleys, climax, close"
        patterns:
          gradual_build: "Start low, steadily increase to climax"
          u_shape: "High open, dip to middle, high close"
          wave: "Multiple peaks with valleys between"
          bookend: "Strong open and close, moderate middle"

      3_insert_valleys_strategically:
        rule: "Place recovery moments before and after peaks"
        reason: "Recovery enables higher peaks"
        guideline: "No more than 2-3 high-intensity items consecutively"

      4_save_best_for_climax:
        rule: "Position the biggest peak at ~75-85% of timeline"
        reason: "End strong, not exhausted"

    anti_patterns:
      - "All peaks, no valleys (exhaustion)"
      - "Climax too early (anticlimactic end)"
      - "Random energy levels (no coherent arc)"
      - "Ending on a valley (weak finish)"

    example:
      context: "Half-day workshop (4 hours)"
      energy_envelope:
        hour_1:
          - "Opening hook (peak - grab attention)"
          - "Context setting (moderate)"
          - "First exercise (moderate-high)"
        hour_2:
          - "Break (valley - recovery)"
          - "Core concept 1 (moderate)"
          - "Discussion (valley)"
        hour_3:
          - "Core concept 2 (moderate)"
          - "Challenging exercise (peak)"
          - "Debrief (valley - recovery)"
        hour_4:
          - "Advanced application (peak - climax)"
          - "Q&A (moderate)"
          - "Strong closing (moderate-high)"
      rationale: "Peaks at hours 1, 3, 4; valleys enable recovery"

  # ANCHOR-BASED ORDERING
  # ----------------------------------------
  anchor_based:
    id: anchor_based_ordering
    name: "Anchor-Based Ordering (Habit Chaining)"
    category: motivation_psychology

    philosophy: |
      Attach new work to existing routines. From behavior design
      (BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits): "After I [existing behavior], I will
      [new behavior]." Sequence tasks so each completed step
      naturally triggers the next. Reduces activation energy.

    when_to_use:
      - Building new habits or routines
      - Onboarding processes
      - Checklists that must flow naturally
      - When motivation is limited
      - Creating reliable sequences

    key_concepts:
      anchor: "Existing reliable behavior that triggers new behavior"
      tiny_behavior: "New behavior scaled down to require minimal effort"
      celebration: "Positive emotion that reinforces the sequence"
      chain: "Multiple behaviors linked in sequence"

    prioritization_rules:
      1_identify_anchors:
        rule: "Find existing reliable behaviors to attach to"
        examples:
          - "After I pour my coffee..."
          - "After I sit at my desk..."
          - "After I finish a meeting..."

      2_sequence_by_natural_flow:
        rule: "Order so each step flows naturally to the next"
        reason: "Reduce friction between steps"
        test: "Does completing step N naturally lead to step N+1?"

      3_start_tiny:
        rule: "Scale down first step to require minimal motivation"
        reason: "Activation energy is highest at start"
        principle: "Make it so easy you can't say no"

      4_build_chains:
        rule: "Link behaviors: A triggers B triggers C"
        reason: "One anchor can cascade through entire routine"

    anti_patterns:
      - "Orphan tasks with no trigger"
      - "Requiring high motivation for first step"
      - "Breaking natural flow with context switches"
      - "Chains that are too long without reinforcement"

    example:
      context: "Morning code review routine"
      anchor_chain:
        anchor: "After I open my laptop"
        step_1: "I will open the PR dashboard (tiny - 2 seconds)"
        step_2: "After dashboard opens, I will pick one PR"
        step_3: "After picking PR, I will read the description"
        step_4: "After reading description, I will leave one comment"
        celebration: "Check off daily code review"
      rationale: "Each step triggers the next; no orphan tasks"
