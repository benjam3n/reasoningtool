name: Analogy Search (Cross-Domain Transfer)
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core
intelligence_reduction: "70%"

goal: |
  Find solutions by searching for analogous problems in other domains
  and transferring their solutions. Systematic domain list reduces
  the intelligence needed.

description: |
  Many problems have been solved before - just in different domains.
  Velcro from burrs, sonar from bats, assembly lines from meatpacking.
  This procedure systematizes the search for useful analogies.

when_to_use:
  - Stuck on a problem
  - Looking for innovative solutions
  - Want to avoid reinventing the wheel
  - Need fresh perspective
  - Problem seems unique (probably isn't)

inputs:
  - name: problem
    type: string
    description: "The problem you're trying to solve"
  - name: problem_structure
    type: description
    description: "Abstract structure of the problem"

outputs:
  - name: analogies_found
    type: list
    description: "Problems from other domains that are structurally similar"
  - name: transferred_solutions
    type: list
    description: "Solutions adapted from analogous domains"

# ============================================
# PROCEDURE STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: "Describe the Problem"
    action: |
      State the problem concretely.
      Include: What's the situation? What's wrong? What do you need?
    output: "Concrete problem description"

  - id: 2
    name: "Extract Problem Structure"
    action: |
      Abstract the problem to its structural elements.
      Remove domain-specific details, keep the pattern.

      Ask:
      - What is the core challenge? (optimization, matching, search, etc.)
      - What are the inputs and outputs?
      - What are the constraints?
      - What makes it hard?
    output: "Abstract problem structure"
    template: |
      CONCRETE: [Specific problem]

      ABSTRACT STRUCTURE:
      - Challenge type: [optimization/matching/search/allocation/etc.]
      - Inputs: [What you start with]
      - Outputs: [What you need]
      - Constraints: [What limits solutions]
      - What makes it hard: [Core difficulty]

  - id: 3
    name: "Search Domains Systematically"
    action: |
      For each domain in the list, ask:
      "What problem in [domain] has similar structure?"
      "How do they solve it?"

      Don't skip domains - even unlikely ones may have insights.
    output: "Analogies from each domain"

  - id: 4
    name: "Evaluate Analogies"
    action: |
      For each analogy found, assess:
      - Structural similarity (how well does it map?)
      - Solution quality (does it work well in source domain?)
      - Transferability (can it be adapted to our domain?)
    output: "Evaluated analogies"
    template: |
      ANALOGY: [Problem from domain X]
      Structural match: [High/Medium/Low]
      Their solution: [How they solve it]
      Transferability: [High/Medium/Low]
      How it might transfer: [Adaptation ideas]

  - id: 5
    name: "Transfer Solutions"
    action: |
      For promising analogies, work out how to transfer:
      - What maps directly?
      - What needs adaptation?
      - What doesn't transfer?
    output: "Transferred solutions"

  - id: 6
    name: "Evaluate Transferred Solutions"
    action: |
      Assess each transferred solution:
      - Does it actually solve the problem?
      - What are the limitations?
      - What would need to change?
    output: "Solution evaluation"

# VERIFICATION
# ============================================

verification:
  - "Problem structure was abstracted (not just surface features)"
  - "Multiple domains were searched systematically"
  - "Structural similarity was assessed, not just surface similarity"
  - "Transfer was explicit about what maps and what doesn't"
  - "Transferred solution addresses the actual problem"
