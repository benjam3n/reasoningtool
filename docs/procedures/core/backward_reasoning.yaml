# Backward Reasoning Procedure
# The method of starting from conclusions and tracing back to foundations

description: |
  Typical reasoning goes "forward" - from premises to conclusions.
  This procedure goes "backward" - from conclusions to premises.

  Given a conclusion, what came before? What journey led here?

  This is harder than forward reasoning but reveals PURPOSE and enables
  evaluation of the journey, not just the endpoint.

core_insight: |
  Any statement is in the middle of a story.

  Before: What led to this statement (journey, goals, context)
  After: What follows from it (implications, consequences)

  Forward reasoning explores "after." Backward reasoning explores "before."

# ============================================
# WHY BACKWARD IS HARDER
# ============================================

why_harder:
  forward:
    description: Given A, what follows?
    characteristics:
      - Often deterministic or near-deterministic
      - Logic provides clear inference rules
      - One premise set → specific conclusions
    example: "If P then Q, P, therefore Q"

  backward:
    description: Given B, what led to it?
    characteristics:
      - Underdetermined - many paths could lead to same conclusion
      - Requires reconstruction, not just inference
      - Multiple premise sets → same conclusion
    example: "Q is true. What P might have implied Q?"

  key_difference: |
    Forward: Calculate
    Backward: Hypothesize and evaluate

    Backward reasoning generates candidate stories and evaluates which
    makes most sense.

# ============================================
# THE METHOD
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Start with the endpoint
    action: |
      Take the conclusion, statement, or position as given.
      Don't question it yet - treat it as the END of a journey.

      Ask: "Someone arrived at this. What journey brought them here?"
    output: endpoint_statement

  - id: 2
    name: Ask "What goal does this serve?"
    action: |
      This conclusion was reached for a REASON.
      What is the statement trying to achieve?

      Not: What are its logical implications?
      But: What PURPOSE does it serve?
    output: immediate_purpose

  - id: 3
    name: Ask "What problem generated that goal?"
    action: |
      Goals arise from problems/needs.
      What problem would make this goal relevant?

      Example:
      Goal: Establish something certain
      Problem: Everything seems doubtable
    output: generating_problem

  - id: 4
    name: Ask "What context created that problem?"
    action: |
      Problems arise in contexts.
      What situation would make this problem salient?

      Example:
      Problem: Everything seems doubtable
      Context: Skepticism is challenging previous beliefs
    output: generating_context

  - id: 5
    name: Continue tracing until reaching foundational goals
    action: |
      Keep asking backward:
      - What led to this context?
      - What underlying values are at play?
      - What would have to be true/desired for this journey to make sense?

      Stop when reaching intrinsic goals (apply intrinsic_goal_termination_gate).
    output: full_backward_trace

  - id: 6
    name: Construct the forward story
    action: |
      Now reverse the trace to construct the "story":

      Chapter 1: Foundational goal/value
      Chapter 2: Context that made it relevant
      Chapter 3: Problem that arose
      Chapter 4: Goal that addressed the problem
      ...
      Final: The conclusion

      This is the journey that (hypothetically) led to the endpoint.
    output: reconstructed_story

  - id: 7
    name: Evaluate the story
    action: |
      Apply story_coherence_gate:
      - Does the story cohere?
      - Are the goals legitimate?
      - Does the conclusion serve the goals?
      - Was the journey necessary?
      - Is this a valid path?

      If coherent: You've understood WHY this conclusion exists.
      If not coherent: Either the conclusion is confused OR your reconstruction is wrong.
    output: story_evaluation

# ============================================
# MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================

multiple_paths: |
  Because backward reasoning is underdetermined, multiple stories
  may explain the same conclusion.

  This is okay. Generate multiple candidates, then:
  1. Evaluate each for coherence
  2. Compare: which is more plausible?
  3. If multiple are equally plausible, that's useful information
     (the conclusion may be overdetermined - supported by multiple paths)

  Red flag: If NO coherent story can be constructed, the conclusion
  may be arbitrary or confused.

# ============================================
# EXAMPLE: RECONSTRUCTING "I THINK THEREFORE I AM"
# ============================================

example:
  endpoint: '"I think therefore I am" (Descartes)'

  step_2_purpose: |
    Establish that at least ONE thing is certain.

  step_3_problem: |
    Everything can be doubted - senses, reasoning, external world.
    If everything can be doubted, no stable knowledge.

  step_4_context: |
    Skeptical challenges to knowledge (ancient and contemporary).
    Need to rebuild knowledge on solid foundation after scholasticism.
    New science requires new epistemology.

  step_5_deeper_trace: |
    Why does knowledge need foundations?
    → Because unreliable beliefs lead to unreliable actions
    → Because unreliable actions lead to poor outcomes
    → Because we want good outcomes (wellbeing)
    → Wellbeing is intrinsically valued (STOP)

  step_6_reconstructed_story:
    ch1: We value wellbeing (intrinsic)
    ch2: Wellbeing requires reliable action
    ch3: Reliable action requires reliable knowledge
    ch4: Reliable knowledge requires foundations
    ch5: Current foundations are unstable (scholasticism challenged)
    ch6: Need new certain foundation
    ch7: Method of doubt - doubt everything, see what survives
    ch8: The doubter can't be doubted
    ch9: "I think therefore I am"

  step_7_evaluation: |
    Coherence: Yes - each chapter connects
    Goals legitimate: Yes - wellbeing, reliable knowledge are reasonable
    Conclusion serves goals: Yes - provides the certain foundation sought
    Journey necessary: Yes - if old foundations are unstable
    Valid path: Yes - the doubt method is reasonable (not only method)

    RESULT: Coherent story. The cogito makes sense as an endpoint.

# ============================================
# WHEN TO USE BACKWARD REASONING
# ============================================

when_to_use:
  - Evaluating a philosophical claim or position
  - Understanding why someone believes something
  - Analyzing a criticism or objection
  - Making sense of an unfamiliar argument
  - Finding the PURPOSE behind any statement

when_not_to_use:
  - Deriving new conclusions (use forward reasoning)
  - When the premises are already clear
  - When you need speed over depth

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO MISSION
# ============================================

mission_connection: |
  From the mission statement:

  "Typical philosophy does 'forward': Given premises, what follows?
   This is like reading a book from beginning to end - but the 'end'
   of philosophy is often nowhere useful.

   Backward reasoning: Given this conclusion, what came before?
   This is like watching the end of a movie and reconstructing the plot."

  Backward reasoning is the CORE METHOD of GOSM. It enables:
  - Understanding WHY conclusions exist (not just what they are)
  - Evaluating the journey (not just the endpoint)
  - Finding the goals that ground everything
  - Terminating n+1 by reaching intrinsic goals

# ============================================
# GOAL UNDERSTANDING PIPELINE
# ============================================
# This procedure is STEP 3 of the goal understanding pipeline:
#
#   1. recursive_causal_interrogation
#      → Question the framing, trace causes of the goal statement
#      → Output: Clearer understanding of what's actually being sought
#
#   2. goal_structure_reconstruction
#      → Trace goal chain: action → goal → goal → intrinsic goal
#      → Output: The "story" of why this goal matters
#
#   3. backward_reasoning (THIS)
#      → Given conclusions, trace back to premises
#      → Output: Understanding of what journey led here
#
#   4. deductive_strategy_discovery
#      → Derive strategies from problem structure
#      → Output: Strategies native to the actual situation
#
# Use backward reasoning after GSR when you want to understand
# the full journey that led to a conclusion or position.

  next: deductive_strategy_discovery
  when_to_use_this_step: |
    Use after GSR when:
    - You have a goal chain and want the full story
    - You're evaluating someone else's conclusion
    - You need to understand what journey led here
    - You want to check if the journey was valid
