version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Decision matrix for choosing between ARAW, Universalization, or both.

  [D: derived from araw_2026-01-28_araw-vs-universalization.md]

  CORE DISTINCTION:
  - ARAW = Boolean negation (claim true/false) [O:source araw-vs-universalization.md]
  - Universalization = Type theory (instance belongs to categories) [O:source araw-vs-universalization.md]

  EPISTEMOLOGICAL:
  - ARAW = Popperian falsification (test claims by trying to disprove)
  - Universalization = Aristotelian taxonomy (classify instances into categories)

matrix:
  # Each entry: task_type -> recommended_method with conditions

  - task_type: "Testing a specific claim"
    recommended: ARAW
    reason: "ARAW stress-tests specific claims through negation [D:falsification serves claim-testing]"
    example: "Is this architecture scalable?"
    when_to_add_universalization: "After ARAW if claim survives, universalize to find edge cases"

  - task_type: "Exploring possibility space"
    recommended: Universalization
    reason: "Universalization maps complete equivalence classes [D:taxonomy serves exploration]"
    example: "What approaches exist for this problem?"
    when_to_add_araw: "After mapping space, ARAW top candidates"

  - task_type: "Finding hidden assumptions"
    recommended: ARAW
    reason: "ASSUME WRONG surfaces assumptions by forcing alternatives [D:negation reveals implicit]"
    example: "What am I assuming about user behavior?"
    when_to_add_universalization: "Universalize discovered assumptions to find patterns"

  - task_type: "Finding analogies/transferred solutions"
    recommended: Universalization
    reason: "Instance-to-category finds sibling instances [D:taxonomy enables transfer]"
    example: "What have others done with similar problems?"
    when_to_add_araw: "ARAW analogies for fitness to this context"

  - task_type: "Validating before commitment"
    recommended: ARAW
    reason: "Binary pass/fail needed before irreversible action [D:falsification guards commitment]"
    example: "Should I sign this contract?"
    when_to_add_universalization: "Universalize contract type to find standard failure modes"

  - task_type: "Brainstorming options"
    recommended: Universalization
    reason: "12 techniques generate maximum option diversity [D:taxonomy maximizes breadth]"
    example: "What could we build?"
    when_to_add_araw: "ARAW most promising options"

  - task_type: "Finding contradictions"
    recommended: ARAW
    reason: "AR + AW on same claim surfaces inconsistency [D:Boolean logic detects contradiction]"
    example: "Is my strategy internally consistent?"
    when_to_add_universalization: "Universalize contradiction pattern to find systemic issues"

  - task_type: "Ensuring completeness"
    recommended: Universalization
    reason: "Exhaustive dimension coverage [D:taxonomy produces complete within known]"
    example: "Have I considered all stakeholders?"
    when_to_add_araw: "ARAW the completeness claim itself"

  - task_type: "Understanding failure modes"
    recommended: ARAW
    reason: "ASSUME WRONG is failure-seeking [D:negation finds what could go wrong]"
    example: "How could this project fail?"
    when_to_add_universalization: "Universalize failures to failure-class to find missed modes"

  - task_type: "Improving writing/thesis"
    recommended: Universalization
    reason: "Subject universalization finds non-obvious angles [T:validated in writing procedure]"
    example: "Make this argument stronger"
    when_to_add_araw: "ARAW the selected angle for soundness"

decision_algorithm:
  step_1: "Identify task type from matrix above"
  step_2: "Use recommended method first"
  step_3: "Check 'when_to_add' condition"
  step_4: "If condition applies, add second method"
  step_5: "If unsure, use UAUA (Universalize → ARAW → Universalize → ARAW)"

quick_heuristics:
  - question: "Am I testing or exploring?"
    test: ARAW
    explore: Universalization

  - question: "Do I need yes/no or a list?"
    yes_no: ARAW
    list: Universalization

  - question: "Am I looking for flaws or options?"
    flaws: ARAW
    options: Universalization

  - question: "Is this convergent (narrowing) or divergent (expanding)?"
    convergent: ARAW
    divergent: Universalization

      - "U1: Map the space with 12 techniques"
      - "A1: ARAW top candidates from mapping"
      - "U2: Universalize surviving candidates to find edge cases"
      - "A2: ARAW edge cases for final validation"
