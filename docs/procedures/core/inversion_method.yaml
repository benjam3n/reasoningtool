# Inversion Method

id: inversion_method
name: Inversion Method (How to Fail)
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core
intelligence_reduction: "75%"

goal: |
  Find how to succeed by first asking "How would I guarantee failure?"
  Then do the opposite. Inversion often reveals non-obvious insights.

  Charlie Munger's favorite technique: "Invert, always invert."
  It's often easier to identify failure modes than success factors.
  Finding ways to fail → Avoiding them → More likely to succeed.

  Also known as: "Kill the company" exercise, Pre-mortem, Via negativa

when_to_use:
  - Planning a project/venture
  - Evaluating a strategy
  - Improving a process
  - Personal goals
  - When "how to succeed" is unclear

# PROCEDURE STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: "State the Goal"
    action: |
      Clearly state what you're trying to achieve.
      Be specific about what success looks like.
    output: "Goal statement"
    template: |
      GOAL: [What I'm trying to achieve]
      SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE: [Observable outcome when successful]

  - id: 2
    name: "Invert the Goal"
    action: |
      Ask: "How would I GUARANTEE failure?"
      Not "might fail" but "definitely fail."

      Reframe: "If I wanted to [opposite of goal], what would I do?"
    output: "Inverted goal"
    template: |
      INVERTED GOAL: How to guarantee [failure/opposite of goal]

  - id: 3
    name: "Brainstorm Failure Modes"
    action: |
      List all the ways to guarantee failure.
      Be thorough and honest. Include:
      - Obvious failures
      - Subtle failures
      - Failures of omission (not doing things)
      - Failures of commission (doing wrong things)
      - Psychological failures (mindset, motivation)
      - Environmental failures (wrong context, timing)
    output: "Exhaustive failure list"
    template: |
      WAYS TO GUARANTEE FAILURE:

      Actions that would cause failure:
      1. [Do X wrong way]
      2. [Do Y at wrong time]
      ...

      Inactions that would cause failure:
      1. [Not do A]
      2. [Not do B]
      ...

      Mindsets that would cause failure:
      1. [Assume X]
      2. [Believe Y]
      ...

  - id: 4
    name: "Invert Each Failure Mode"
    action: |
      For each failure mode, state its opposite.
      This becomes a success factor.
    output: "Success factors"
    template: |
      FAILURE MODE → SUCCESS FACTOR

      [Failure 1] → [Do opposite: Success 1]
      [Failure 2] → [Do opposite: Success 2]
      ...

  - id: 5
    name: "Prioritize Success Factors"
    action: |
      Not all success factors are equal.
      Prioritize by:
      - Impact (how much does this matter?)
      - Controllability (can I actually do this?)
      - Likelihood (how likely is the failure mode?)
    output: "Prioritized success factors"
    template: |
      HIGH PRIORITY (Must do):
      - [Success factor 1]
      - [Success factor 2]

      MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should do):
      - [Success factor 3]
      - [Success factor 4]

      LOWER PRIORITY (Nice to do):
      - [Success factor 5]

  - id: 6
    name: "Create Action Plan"
    action: |
      Convert success factors to specific actions.
      Include both:
      - Things TO DO
      - Things to AVOID
    output: "Action plan"
    template: |
      ACTION PLAN:

      DO:
      □ [Specific action 1]
      □ [Specific action 2]
      ...

      DON'T:
      □ Avoid [thing 1]
      □ Avoid [thing 2]
      ...

      WATCH FOR (warning signs of failure modes):
      □ [Early indicator 1]
      □ [Early indicator 2]
      ...

# EXAMPLE
# ============================================

example:
  goal: "Launch a successful software product"

  failure_modes:
    actions:
      - "Build without talking to customers"
      - "Add every feature anyone mentions"
      - "Launch when it's 'perfect'"
      - "Ignore competition"
      - "Underprice thinking volume will come"

    inactions:
      - "Don't validate the problem exists"
      - "Don't define target customer"
      - "Don't set success metrics"
      - "Don't plan for iteration"

    mindset:
      - "Assume I know what customers want"
      - "Believe if I build it they will come"
      - "Think first version must be complete"

  inversions:
    - '"Build without customers" → "Talk to customers before/during building"'
    - '"Add every feature" → "Ruthlessly prioritize, say no to most"'
    - '"Wait for perfect" → "Launch MVP, iterate"'
    - '"Assume I know" → "Validate assumptions explicitly"'
    - '"If I build it they will come" → "Plan distribution from day 1"'

  action_plan:
    do:
      - "Interview 20 potential customers before building"
      - "Define ONE core use case to nail"
      - "Set launch date, ship whatever is ready"
      - "Build distribution channel in parallel"

    dont:
      - "Don't add features without customer evidence"
      - "Don't delay launch for 'one more thing'"
      - "Don't assume, validate"

verification:
  - "Goal was clearly stated"
  - "Failure modes are genuine (would actually cause failure)"
  - "Inversions are true opposites"
  - "Actions are specific and actionable"
  - "Both do's and don'ts are included"
