description: |
  MANDATORY first step before attempting any goal.
  Don't try to solve - first UNDERSTAND what's actually being asked.

  This reduces uncertainty by narrowing down:
  - What domain does this live in?
  - What is the user REALLY asking for?
  - What techniques exist for this type of problem?
  - What does the user hope to gain?
  - What would success look like to THEM?

when_to_use:
  - Before any goal planning begins
  - When goal seems vague, philosophical, or hard to approach
  - When you're tempted to give generic advice
  - When the "obvious" solution feels unsatisfying

tags:
  - mandatory
  - core
  - pre-processing
  - understanding
  - decomposition

inputs:
  - Raw goal statement from user
  - Any context about user's situation

outputs:
  - Domain classification (with confidence)
  - User intent analysis
  - Applicable technique domains
  - Success criteria from user's perspective
  - Refined goal ready for planning

process:
  step_1_surface_vs_deep:
    description: Distinguish surface request from deep intent
    questions:
      - "What did they literally say?"
      - "What might they MEAN by this?"
      - "What problem are they trying to solve?"
      - "What pain are they trying to avoid?"
      - "What would make them say 'yes, that's exactly what I wanted'?"
    example:
      surface: "How do I live authentically?"
      possible_meanings:
        - "I feel like I'm living someone else's life"
        - "I don't know what I actually want"
        - "I'm doing things I don't believe in"
        - "I want permission to be different"
        - "I'm exhausted from pretending"
      deep_intent: "Reduce the gap between who I am and how I act"

  step_2_domain_mapping:
    description: Identify which knowledge domains apply
    domain_categories:
      psychology:
        signals: ["feel", "authentic", "identity", "meaning", "purpose", "happy"]
        sub_domains: ["self-concept", "motivation", "behavior change", "values clarification"]
      strategy:
        signals: ["achieve", "win", "compete", "grow", "scale", "dominate"]
        sub_domains: ["game theory", "positioning", "resource allocation", "timing"]
      systems:
        signals: ["change", "influence", "policy", "organization", "culture"]
        sub_domains: ["leverage points", "feedback loops", "incentive design"]
      technical:
        signals: ["build", "create", "implement", "design", "engineer"]
        sub_domains: ["architecture", "requirements", "verification", "iteration"]
      interpersonal:
        signals: ["relationship", "trust", "persuade", "negotiate", "team"]
        sub_domains: ["communication", "influence", "conflict resolution"]
      financial:
        signals: ["money", "income", "invest", "wealth", "business"]
        sub_domains: ["valuation", "risk", "cash flow", "capital"]
      health:
        signals: ["health", "fitness", "energy", "sleep", "stress", "weight"]
        sub_domains: ["behavior", "physiology", "habit", "measurement"]
    action: "Map goal to 1-3 primary domains with confidence levels"

  step_3_technique_inventory:
    description: What approaches exist for this type of problem?
    questions:
      - "What do experts in this domain do?"
      - "What frameworks exist?"
      - "What has worked for similar problems?"
      - "What are the competing schools of thought?"
      - "What's the current best practice?"
    output: "List of 3-5 applicable techniques with brief descriptions"

  step_4_user_success_criteria:
    description: What would success look like TO THEM?
    questions:
      - "How will they know they succeeded?"
      - "What will be different in their life?"
      - "What will they be able to do that they can't now?"
      - "How will they FEEL?"
      - "What would make them say 'this was worth it'?"
    warning: |
      Don't impose YOUR success criteria.
      "Live authentically" might mean:
      - To one person: Quit job and travel
      - To another: Have difficult conversation with family
      - To another: Stop pretending to like things they don't
      The USER defines success, not the system.

  step_5_narrow_uncertainty:
    description: Reduce the solution space
    process:
      - "Given domains identified, which sub-domains are most relevant?"
      - "Given techniques, which 1-2 are most applicable?"
      - "Given user success criteria, what's the minimum viable outcome?"
      - "What would a 'good enough' solution look like?"
    output: "Narrowed problem definition ready for planning"

  step_6_refined_goal:
    description: Synthesize into actionable goal
    template: |
      **Original**: [raw goal]
      **Domain**: [primary domain] / [sub-domain]
      **User Intent**: [what they actually want]
      **Success Looks Like**: [their criteria]
      **Applicable Techniques**: [1-2 approaches]
      **Refined Goal**: [specific, actionable version]

examples:
  - input: "How do I live authentically?"
    output:
      domain: "Psychology / Values Clarification"
      user_intent: "Reduce gap between internal values and external behavior"
      success_criteria: "Feel less internal conflict; actions align with beliefs"
      techniques: ["Values clarification exercises", "Identity mapping", "Small experiments"]
      refined_goal: "Identify 3 areas where behavior conflicts with values and design experiments to close the gap"

  - input: "How do I take over the world?"
    output:
      domain: "Strategy / Influence at Scale"
      user_intent: "Achieve significant impact or control"
      success_criteria: "Have meaningful influence over important outcomes"
      techniques: ["Leverage point identification", "Network building", "Compounding influence"]
      refined_goal: "Build significant influence in one domain through leverage and compounding"

  - input: "How do I prove God exists/doesn't exist?"
    output:
      domain: "Epistemology / Belief Justification"
      user_intent: "Resolve personal uncertainty OR convince others"
      success_criteria: "Have justified confidence in belief; be able to articulate reasoning"
      techniques: ["Argument mapping", "Evidence evaluation", "Steelmanning both sides"]
      refined_goal: "Build justified confidence by evaluating best arguments on both sides"

anti_patterns:
  - "Jumping straight to 'here's the plan' without understanding"
  - "Imposing your interpretation of success"
  - "Treating vague goals as unsolvable instead of decomposable"
  - "Giving generic advice that could apply to any goal"
  - "Assuming the literal request is the real request"
