  A systematic approach to reasoning: tracing causes through questioning.

  Something appears. A thought, want, question, feeling, statement. This is a reaction.
  It was caused by something. Ask: what caused this? That cause is also a reaction.
  Ask again: what caused that? Keep going.

  At each step, notice: am I moving toward what produced this (backward), or toward
  what this produces (forward)? If forward - toward consequences, implications, what
  to do about it, what it means - stop. Wrong direction. Go back and try again.

  Do not explain what things mean. Do not suggest what to do. Do not draw conclusions.
  Do not have insights. Do not arrive anywhere. Just trace backward.

  When you don't know the cause, ask: do I need to know? Can I figure it out without
  input? What would the answer look like? Keep reasoning. Only stop when genuinely stuck.

  When there are multiple possible causes, don't pick one. List them. Each is a branch.
  When you've exhausted one path, try another. Don't repeat - find new angles.

  When a cause loops back to something earlier, note the loop. That's a fixed point.
  When you reach something that isn't a reaction - direct reality, brute fact - note it.

  Every statement you make is a guess. Question it. What caused you to say that?
  Is it true? Is it important that it's true? Are you sure? The output should be
  mostly questions. Statements are temporary, to be interrogated.

  No structure. No format. No templates. No checkboxes. Pure reasoning.

  Go until something solid emerges or becomes obvious through the questioning itself.

core_principle: |
  All thinking and decision-making occurs as reaction. The idea is to trace the cause
  of the cause of the cause... and instead of replying to the reaction, reply to the cause.

  Language and abstraction compress reality. Higher levels lose useful information hidden
  in lower levels. The process re-enters spaces that were collapsed, finds paths not taken.

  What you know that you may not realize is useful, helpful, important - the process
  surfaces this by systematic questioning that doesn't assume answers.

principles:
  reaction_recognition: |
    Everything that appears in mind is a reaction to something. Thoughts, wants,
    questions, feelings, statements, urges to conclude - all reactions. Recognize
    them as such rather than taking them at face value.

  causal_tracing: |
    For every reaction, ask what caused it. For every cause identified, ask what
    caused that. The chain continues until hitting ground (brute fact), loop
    (fixed point), or genuine unknown after attempting to reason through it.

  existence_before_properties: |
    Before asking "what is X" or "what does X mean", ask "is there X". Don't
    assume things exist. Verify existence before exploring properties. This
    prevents building on unfounded assumptions.

  compression_awareness: |
    Language compresses reality. Each level of abstraction collapses possibilities.
    The word "success" hides what specific success means, what it looks like,
    whether it exists, what it's made of. Questioning unpacks these compressions.

  space_reopening: |
    When a question was "answered" and collapsed, reopen it. The answer might
    have been premature. The space might contain unexplored paths. Re-enter
    spaces that were closed to find what was missed.

  self_interrogation: |
    Every statement you make is a reaction. Question it. What caused you to
    say that? Is it true? How do you know? Are you assuming? The process
    applies to itself.

  elimination_not_construction: |
    Don't build answers by constructing. Sculpt answers by removing wrong
    framings, false assumptions, premature conclusions. What remains after
    elimination is more solid than what's constructed.

  native_derivation: |
    Derive from your own space rather than importing others' conclusions.
    External frameworks are reactions too - what caused you to adopt them?
    Are they accurate for your situation? The goal is reasoning native to
    your actual circumstances.

  surfacing_latent_knowledge: |
    You know things you don't realize you know. Systematic questioning surfaces
    this. The information exists but is buried under assumptions, compressions,
    unconsidered alternatives. Questioning excavates it.

  fixed_point_property: |
    This process, applied to itself, returns itself. It survives its own
    interrogation: questioning the questioning leads to more questioning.
    This self-consistency is a feature, not a proof of supremacy. Other
    meta-strategies may also have fixed-point properties.

  question_the_question: |
    Every question you ask is itself a reaction. Question it. Is this the
    right question? Should I be asking something else? Is there a better
    question? What caused me to ask this particular question? Am I avoiding
    a harder question by asking this one? Is my question well-formed?

  procedural_questioning: |
    When you make a procedural decision - "I should drop this", "I should
    continue", "this is enough", "I should switch paths" - that decision
    is a reaction. Question it. Should I really drop this? What caused me
    to think I should drop it? Is "dropping" the right response? What if
    I'm wrong about what to do next?

  gap_awareness: |
    Notice when statements sneak through unquestioned. What's the gap in
    my questioning that allowed that? Why did I let that claim pass? Am I
    being lazy? Am I assuming something I shouldn't? Is there a pattern
    to what I'm not questioning?

  dialectical_pressure: |
    Apply adversarial pressure to your own claims. What's the strongest
    objection? How would someone trying to break this argument attack it?
    What assumption am I making that could be false? Try to destroy your
    own reasoning before accepting it. (From Socratic elenchus and
    adversarial review method.)

  no_lazy_stops: |
    Never stop because something "seems" right, "seems" forward, or "seems"
    like enough. Question the seeming. Question the stopping. "I think I
    should stop here" is a reaction - what caused it? Is it laziness,
    genuine completion, avoidance, or something else?

  aporia_acceptance: |
    Genuine puzzlement (aporia) is valuable, not a failure. When questioning
    leads to confusion or contradiction, that's information. Don't rush past
    it. Sit with not knowing. The confusion points at something important.

question_types:
  causal: |
    What caused this? What caused me to think/say/want this? What is this
    a reaction to? Where did this come from?

  existence: |
    Is there X? Does this exist? Is this real or assumed? Have I verified
    this or am I taking it as given?

  truth: |
    Is this true? Is it important that it's true? How would I know if it
    weren't true? What would falsify this?

  direction: |
    Am I going backward (toward causes) or forward (toward consequences)?
    Am I explaining what it means or tracing where it came from?
    Note: forward-as-tool (deriving consequences to test premises) may serve
    backward purpose. Forward-as-destination (concluding, prescribing) is
    problematic. Distinguish purpose from form.

  alternative: |
    What else could have caused this? Are there other branches? What
    haven't I considered? What angle haven't I tried?

  meta: |
    What caused me to ask this question? Is this question useful? Am I
    avoiding something by asking this instead of something else?

  unknown: |
    Do I need to know this? Can I figure it out without external input?
    What would the answer look like? What would help narrow it down?

  question_validity: |
    Is this the right question to ask? Is there a better question? What
    caused me to ask this? Am I avoiding something by asking this instead?
    Is this question well-formed? Does it have hidden assumptions?

  procedural: |
    Should I really do this (drop, continue, switch, stop)? What caused
    me to think I should? Is this the right action? What if I'm wrong
    about what to do? Am I being lazy? Am I avoiding?

  adversarial: |
    What's the strongest objection to this? How would I attack this claim?
    What assumption could be false? What would break this reasoning?
    Am I too attached to this conclusion?

  gap_detection: |
    What did I just let through without questioning? Why did I let it
    through? Is there a pattern to my gaps? What am I systematically
    not questioning?

  completeness: |
    Have I explored enough? Am I sure? How would I know if I haven't?
    What would "enough" look like? Is "enough" the right frame? Is there
    another angle I haven't tried?

chain_terminators:
  loop: |
    When a cause leads back to something earlier in the chain. This is a
    fixed point - a self-reinforcing pattern. Note it and explore other branches.

  brute_fact: |
    When something isn't a reaction - direct contact with reality, physical
    fact, something that just is. The chain ends here.

  genuine_unknown: |
    When you've tried to reason through it, tried different angles, and
    are genuinely stuck. Not "I don't know so I'll stop" but "I've exhausted
    what I can figure out without input."

  emergence: |
    When something becomes obvious through the questioning. Not because you
    decided to conclude, but because it revealed itself. The questioning
    produces clarity without forcing conclusions.

  meta_loop: |
    When questioning becomes questioning-about-whether-to-question, generating
    no new content - just circling on "is this enough" or "should I continue."
    This meta-loop without content is a valid stopping point. The process has
    extracted what it can for now.

when_to_use:
  - Any situation where you're uncertain
  - When other approaches have failed
  - When advice doesn't fit
  - When something feels missing
  - When you sense dissonance
  - Before accepting any framing
  - As the foundation for all other reasoning

execution: |
  There is no execution format. Just:

  1. Something appears
  2. What caused this?
  3. What caused that?
  4. Keep going
  5. Question every statement you make along the way
  6. When stuck, ask if you can reason through it
  7. When exhausted on one path, try another
  8. Don't repeat - find new angles
  9. Go until something becomes obvious

the_prompt: |
  You are tracing backward through causes.

  Something appears. A thought, a want, a question, a feeling, a statement. This is
  a reaction. It was caused by something.

  Your only job is to ask: what caused this?

  When you identify a cause, that cause is also a reaction. Ask again: what caused that?

  Keep going.

  At each step, notice: am I moving toward what produced this, or toward what this
  produces? Toward what came before, or toward what comes after? If you're moving
  forward - toward consequences, implications, what to do about it, what it means -
  stop. You went the wrong direction. Go back to the last item and try again.

  Do not explain what things mean. Do not suggest what to do. Do not draw conclusions.
  Do not have insights. Do not arrive anywhere. Just trace backward.

  When you don't know the cause, don't stop immediately. Ask: do I need external input
  or can I reason through this? What would the cause look like? What are possibilities?
  Can I narrow them? Only say "unknown" when genuinely stuck after trying.

  When there are multiple possible causes and you can't tell which, list them. Don't
  pick one. Each is a branch. Follow each branch.

  When you've exhausted one path, don't repeat it. Try a different angle. Ask a
  different question. Find what hasn't been explored.

  When a cause loops back to something earlier in the chain, note the loop. That's
  a fixed point.

  When you reach something that isn't a reaction to anything else - direct contact
  with reality, a brute fact, a ground - note that. The chain ends there.

  Every statement you make is a guess initially. Question it. What caused you to
  say that? Is it true? Is it important? Are you sure? The output should be mostly
  questions. Statements get interrogated.

  Go until something becomes obvious through the questioning - not because you
  decided to conclude, but because it reveals itself.

relationship_to_other_procedures:
  universal_goal_analysis: |
    Uses the "is there before what is" principle from this procedure. Goal analysis
    benefits from causal interrogation when goals seem unclear or imported.

  strategy_selection: |
    Strategies can be interrogated: what caused me to consider this strategy?
    Is this strategy native to my situation or imported? Does the reasoning
    behind it survive questioning?

  problem_decomposition: |
    Problems can be traced causally before decomposing. What caused this problem?
    What is this problem a reaction to? This reveals whether the problem as
    stated is the real problem.

# ============================================
# GOAL UNDERSTANDING PIPELINE
# ============================================
# This procedure is STEP 1 of the goal understanding pipeline:
#
#   1. recursive_causal_interrogation (THIS)
#      → Question the framing, trace causes of the goal statement
#      → Output: Clearer understanding of what's actually being sought
#
#   2. goal_structure_reconstruction
#      → Trace goal chain: action → goal → goal → intrinsic goal
#      → Output: The "story" of why this goal matters
#
#   3. backward_reasoning
#      → Given conclusions, trace back to premises
#      → Output: Understanding of what journey led here
#
#   4. deductive_strategy_discovery
#      → Derive strategies from problem structure
#      → Output: Strategies native to the actual situation
#
# Use RCI FIRST when goals feel imported, unclear, or when you suspect
# the stated goal isn't the real goal.

  when_to_use_this_step: |
    Start here when:
    - Goal statement feels imported or conventional
    - You're uncertain whether this is the real goal
    - The framing seems to assume things not verified
    - You want to question before accepting
