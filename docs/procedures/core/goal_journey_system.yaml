  A goal journey is NOT a narrative arc. It's a CHAIN OF GOALS.

  Every action serves a goal.
  Every goal serves another goal.
  The chain terminates at intrinsic goals (valued for themselves).

  The journey IS the goal chain. Understanding the journey means
  understanding what goals are being served all the way up to
  intrinsic values.

core_insight: |
  The insight from the mission statement:
  - All language has a goal
  - Every action is trying to achieve something
  - You can trace backward: "What goal does this serve?"

  A goal journey traces this chain from current action to intrinsic goal.

  This is NOT the same as a "story structure" like Hero's Journey.
  Story structures are about narrative beats.
  Goal journeys are about PURPOSE CHAINS.

# ============================================
# WHAT IS A GOAL JOURNEY?
# ============================================

definition:
  a_goal_journey_is: |
    A chain of goals where each goal serves the next, terminating
    at an intrinsic goal.

    Example:
    - Action: Learning music theory
    - Serves goal: Improve at music
    - Serves goal: Deepen meaningful experience
    - Serves goal: Have meaningful experiences
    - Serves goal: Flourish/wellbeing (INTRINSIC - STOP)

    The JOURNEY is this chain: Action → Goal → Goal → ... → Intrinsic Goal

  a_goal_journey_is_not:
    - A sequence of events (that's a narrative)
    - A list of steps to complete (that's a procedure)
    - A story arc (that's narrative structure)
    - A timeline (that's chronology)

  the_difference: |
    Narrative: "First this happened, then that happened"
    Goal journey: "This serves that, which serves that, which serves..."

    Narrative asks: What comes next?
    Goal journey asks: What does this serve?

  levels:
    intrinsic_goal:
      description: "Goals valued for themselves, not for what they lead to"
      note: |
        IMPORTANT: "Flourishing" is NOT the only intrinsic goal.
        Different people have different intrinsic goals.
        These may conflict with each other.
        Some people have "anti-flourishing" goals (and that's valid).

        Use value elicitation: "What's important to you about X?"
        Keep asking until you get circularity (terminus).

        See intrinsic_goal_termination_gate for full details.

      categories:
        positive_states: [Pleasure, Happiness, Peace, Joy, Excitement]
        relational: [Love, Connection, Belonging, Recognition, Acceptance]
        meaning_based: [Meaning, Purpose, Significance, Legacy, Contribution]
        freedom_based: [Freedom, Autonomy, Independence, Self-determination]
        security_based: [Security, Safety, Stability, Control, Predictability]
        achievement_based: [Achievement, Mastery, Power, Status, Excellence]
        aesthetic: [Beauty, Knowledge, Understanding, Truth, Novelty]
        anti_flourishing:
          description: "Valid goals that oppose conventional wellbeing"
          examples: [Asceticism, Sacrifice, Simplicity, "Playing to lose", Tradition]
          note: "Monks, priests, martyrs - these are valid intrinsic goals"

      termination: |
        The chain stops when asking "why?" leads to circularity:
        "Why do you want X?" → "Because X is what I value"

        Different people terminate at different values:
        - Some at Freedom
        - Some at Security
        - Some at Connection
        - Some at Achievement
        - Some at Spiritual purity

        There is no universal "correct" terminus.

    high_instrumental:
      description: "Goals that broadly serve intrinsic goals"
      examples:
        - Have meaningful experiences (serves wellbeing)
        - Build deep relationships (serves connection)
        - Develop capabilities (serves flourishing)
        - Create valuable things (serves meaning)
      note: "These are still somewhat abstract but clearly instrumental"

    mid_instrumental:
      description: "Goals that serve high-instrumental goals"
      examples:
        - Improve at a skill (serves developing capabilities)
        - Engage with a community (serves building relationships)
        - Work on important problems (serves creating value)
      note: "More specific, but still applicable across many domains"

    low_instrumental:
      description: "Goals close to specific actions"
      examples:
        - Learn music theory (serves improving at music)
        - Attend the meetup (serves engaging with community)
        - Fix this bug (serves completing the project)
      note: "Domain-specific, close to action level"

    action:
      description: "The specific thing being done"
      examples:
        - Reading this chapter on harmony
        - Sending this email to the organizer
        - Writing this function
      note: "This is where goal chains connect to reality"

  chain_format: |
    A goal journey is written as a chain:

    [Action]
      ↓ serves
    [Low Instrumental Goal]
      ↓ serves
    [Mid Instrumental Goal]
      ↓ serves
    [High Instrumental Goal]
      ↓ serves
    [Intrinsic Goal] ← TERMINUS

    The chain can have more or fewer levels depending on how
    direct the path from action to intrinsic goal is.

# ============================================
# TYPES OF GOAL CHAINS
# ============================================

chain_types:
  direct:
    description: "Action directly serves intrinsic goal"
    structure: "Action → Intrinsic"
    example: |
      Eating delicious food → Pleasure (intrinsic)
    characteristics:
      - Short chain
      - Immediate satisfaction
      - No intermediate goals
    common_in: "Basic needs, immediate pleasures"

  simple:
    description: "One or two intermediate goals"
    structure: "Action → Goal → Intrinsic"
    example: |
      Going for a walk → Feel better → Wellbeing (intrinsic)
    characteristics:
      - Clear path
      - Easy to trace
      - Obvious connection
    common_in: "Daily activities, simple self-care"

  extended:
    description: "Multiple intermediate goals"
    structure: "Action → Goal → Goal → Goal → Intrinsic"
    example: |
      Learning music theory
        → Improve at music
        → Create meaningful art
        → Express myself
        → Flourish (intrinsic)
    characteristics:
      - Longer path
      - Each step clearly serves next
      - Common in skill development
    common_in: "Learning, career, long-term projects"

  branching:
    description: "One action serves multiple goal chains"
    structure: |
      Action → Goal A → Intrinsic X
            ↘ Goal B → Intrinsic Y
    example: |
      Starting a business
        → Financial security → Wellbeing
        → Creative expression → Meaning
        → Build something lasting → Purpose
    characteristics:
      - Multiple payoffs
      - Robust (if one chain breaks, others remain)
      - Common in major life choices
    common_in: "Career choices, relationships, big decisions"

  convergent:
    description: "Multiple actions serve the same goal"
    structure: |
      Action A ↘
      Action B → Goal → Intrinsic
      Action C ↗
    example: |
      Exercise     ↘
      Good sleep   → Health → Wellbeing
      Good food    ↗
    characteristics:
      - Redundancy
      - Multiple paths to same goal
      - Flexibility in methods
    common_in: "Health, learning, any goal with multiple approaches"

  conflicting:
    description: "One action serves one goal but undermines another"
    structure: |
      Action → Goal A → Intrinsic X
           ↘ Undermines Goal B → Intrinsic Y
    example: |
      Working long hours
        → Career success → Achievement
        → But undermines: Family time → Connection
    characteristics:
      - Tradeoffs required
      - Can't optimize both
      - Requires value prioritization
    common_in: "Work-life balance, any situation with tradeoffs"

  recursive:
    description: "Achieving the goal requires the goal"
    structure: "To achieve A, need A"
    example: |
      To get experience, need a job
      To get a job, need experience
    characteristics:
      - Bootstrap problem
      - Requires breaking the loop
      - Often solved by finding alternative entry
    common_in: "Career starts, skill chicken-and-egg problems"

  transforming:
    description: "Achieving the goal changes what you want"
    structure: "Action → Goal A → Achieve A → Now want Goal B"
    example: |
      Pursue wealth → Get wealthy → Realize wanted meaning, not wealth
    characteristics:
      - Goals shift after achievement
      - Original chain becomes obsolete
      - New chain emerges
    common_in: "Major life achievements, any 'arrival fallacy' situation"

# ============================================
# STEP QUALITY AND GRANULARITY
# ============================================

step_quality:
  description: |
    Each step in a goal journey must be:
    1. A proper verb phrase (action) or goal statement (outcome)
    2. Non-reducible without circling back
    3. Clear service relationship to next step
    4. No skipped steps

  bad_examples:
    sloppy_chain:
      chain: "Building → Structures → Reliable → Decisions → Action"
      problems:
        - "'Structures' is a noun, not a goal"
        - "'Reliable' is an adjective, not a goal"
        - "'Decisions' is a noun, not a goal"
        - "Steps are skipped - how does 'reliable' lead to 'decisions'?"
        - "No verb forms - what action is being taken?"

    too_abstract:
      chain: "Do thing → Get result → Be happy"
      problems:
        - "What thing? What result?"
        - "No specificity - could mean anything"
        - "Not falsifiable or evaluable"

  good_examples:
    proper_form:
      chain: |
        Perform action X
          ↓ serves
        Achieve immediate outcome Y
          ↓ serves
        Enable capability Z
          ↓ serves
        Attain valued state W
          ↓ serves
        Experience intrinsic value V (TERMINUS)

      note: "Each step is a verb phrase or clear outcome, with explicit service"

    manufacturing_style:
      description: "Example from manufacturing - shows proper granularity"
      chain: |
        A2 (Planning):
        1. Decide materials, processes, and resources needed
           → Selection, matching, comparison, optimizing, costs
        2. Decide production path
           → Reorder, reroute, constraint check, feasibility check, optimize
        3. Decide instructions and setups for processing equipment
           → Diagram, program, parameter setting, documentation
        4. Decide changes in existing material flows
           → Analyzing, redesign, optimization, simulation, streamlining
        5. Create floor layout
           → Arranging, allocating, optimizing, visualizing, integrating
        6. Change design to improve manufacturability
           → Evaluation, modification, simplification, standardization

      note: |
        Each step:
        - Is a specific verb phrase (Decide, Create, Change)
        - Cannot be reduced further without circling back
        - Has clear activities that compose it
        - Serves the next step in manufacturing process

  granularity_test: |
    For each step, ask:
    1. Can this step be broken into sub-steps? If yes, is each sub-step
       necessary, or are they just activities within this step?
    2. Can this step be removed? If yes, does the chain still work?
    3. Does removing this step create a gap in service?

    A step is at the right granularity when:
    - Breaking it down further creates redundancy or circularity
    - Removing it breaks the service chain
    - It clearly serves the next step (no gaps)

  verb_requirement: |
    Each goal should be expressed as either:
    1. Verb phrase: "Achieve X", "Acquire Y", "Enable Z", "Experience W"
    2. Outcome statement: "X is achieved", "Y is acquired", "Z is enabled"

    NOT:
    - Nouns alone: "Structures", "Decisions", "Reliability"
    - Adjectives: "Reliable", "Better", "Effective"
    - Abstract labels: "Success", "Improvement"

# ============================================
# VALUE ELICITATION
# ============================================

value_elicitation:
  description: |
    Technique for discovering someone's intrinsic goals.
    See intrinsic_goal_termination_gate for full details.

  core_questions:
    - "What's important to you about [X]?"
    - "When you have [X], what does that give you?"
    - "Why is [X] important to you?"

  usage: |
    Keep asking until you get circularity:

    "What's important to you about owning a business?"
    → "Freedom from employment constraints"
    "What's important to you about freedom?"
    → "Being free is what I value" (TERMINUS - circularity)

    Different people reach different terminus points.

  key_insight: |
    The same action can serve different intrinsic goals for different people:

    Person A: Business → Freedom (intrinsic)
    Person B: Business → Security (intrinsic)
    Person C: Business → Recognition (intrinsic)

    Don't assume. Use value elicitation to discover.

# ============================================
# MULTIPLE AND CONFLICTING INTRINSIC GOALS
# ============================================

multiple_goals:
  description: |
    People typically have MULTIPLE intrinsic goals.
    These often CONFLICT with each other.

  examples:
    - '"I want Freedom AND Security" (often trade-offs)'
    - '"I want Achievement AND Peace" (often trade-offs)'
    - '"I want Connection AND Independence" (often trade-offs)'

  implications:
    - A single action may serve some intrinsic goals while undermining others
    - This creates TENSION in the goal journey
    - Satisfaction may require balancing, not maximizing one goal
    - Different decisions may prioritize different intrinsic goals

  chain_type: "conflicting"
  note: "See chain_types section for conflicting chain structure"

# ============================================
# GOAL JOURNEY EXTRACTION
# ============================================

extraction:
  description: |
    Given an action, statement, or situation, extract the goal journey.

  steps:
    - id: 1
      name: "Identify the action or statement"
      action: |
        What is being done or said?
        Be specific: not "working on project" but "writing this function"

    - id: 2
      name: "Ask: What goal does this serve?"
      action: |
        What is this action trying to achieve?
        Not "what happens next" but "what is this FOR?"

    - id: 3
      name: "Ask: What goal does THAT serve?"
      action: |
        The goal you identified is also instrumental.
        What does achieving that goal enable or serve?

    - id: 4
      name: "Continue until intrinsic goal"
      action: |
        Keep asking "what does that serve?"
        Stop when you reach something valued for itself:
        - Wellbeing
        - Meaning
        - Connection
        - Understanding
        - etc.

        Apply intrinsic_goal_termination_gate if unsure.

    - id: 5
      name: "Verify the chain"
      action: |
        Read the chain from bottom (action) to top (intrinsic):
        - Does each step clearly serve the next?
        - Are there missing links?
        - Is the intrinsic goal legitimate?

    - id: 6
      name: "Identify chain type"
      action: |
        Is this chain:
        - Direct (very short)?
        - Simple (1-2 intermediates)?
        - Extended (many intermediates)?
        - Branching (serves multiple goals)?
        - Conflicting (undermines other goals)?
        - etc.

# GOAL JOURNEY VALIDATION
# ============================================

validation:
  question: "Is this goal journey valid?"

  checks:
    service_check:
      question: "Does each level clearly serve the next?"
      pass: "Yes, the connection is clear"
      fail: "There's a jump - why does A serve B?"
      repair: "Find the missing link or question the connection"

    terminus_check:
      question: "Does the chain reach an intrinsic goal?"
      pass: "Yes, terminates at something valued for itself"
      fail: "Chain ends at something instrumental"
      repair: "Keep asking 'what does that serve?'"

    legitimacy_check:
      question: "Is the intrinsic goal legitimate?"
      pass: "Yes, reasonable people would value this"
      fail: "Goal is unusual or questionable"
      repair: "Either find deeper goal or acknowledge unusual values"

    completeness_check:

      pass: "Yes, no jumps in the chain"
      fail: "There's a gap between levels"
      repair: "Fill in the missing intermediate goals"

  overall: |
    A goal journey is VALID if:
    - Each step serves the next (service)
    - Chain reaches intrinsic goal (terminus)
    - Intrinsic goal is legitimate (legitimacy)
    - No missing links (completeness)

# ============================================
# WHAT MAKES A GOAL JOURNEY SATISFYING?
# ============================================

satisfaction:
  description: |
    A goal journey is SATISFYING when:
    1. You can see WHY you're doing what you're doing
    2. The chain makes sense - each step clearly serves the next
    3. The terminus is something you actually value
    4. The current action is actually serving the chain

  satisfying_indicators:
    - "Now I understand why I'm doing this"
    - "This connects to what I actually care about"
    - "Each step makes sense"
    - "I can see the path from here to what matters"

  unsatisfying_indicators:
    - "I'm doing this but I don't know why"
    - "This doesn't connect to anything I care about"
    - "There's a jump I can't explain"
    - "The end goal doesn't feel like MY goal"

  the_key_insight: |
    Satisfaction comes from COHERENCE and LEGITIMACY.

    Coherence: The chain holds together
    Legitimacy: The terminus is truly valued

    If someone can see their goal journey clearly, and it connects
    their current action to something they genuinely value, that's
    satisfying.

    If there are gaps, or the terminus doesn't resonate, that's
    unsatisfying - and points to something worth examining.

# ============================================
# SEMI-GENERALIZABILITY FOR GOAL JOURNEYS
# ============================================

generalizability:
  description: |
    What makes a goal journey semi-generalizable?

    NOT the specific actions or goals.
    BUT the PATTERN of the chain.

  example: |
    Specific journey:
      Learning music theory → Improve at guitar → Create music →
      Express myself → Flourish

    Generalized pattern:
      Acquiring foundational knowledge → Improve at craft →
      Create in domain → Self-expression → Flourishing

    The pattern applies to:
    - Learning programming → Improve at coding → Build software → Create value → Flourishing
    - Studying writing → Improve at prose → Write stories → Express truth → Meaning
    - Learning cooking → Improve at food → Feed people → Nurture connection → Love

  the_semi_generalizable_part: |
    The LEVELS and their RELATIONSHIPS are generalizable.
    The SPECIFIC CONTENT is not.

    Pattern: "Foundational knowledge → Craft improvement → Creation → Expression → Intrinsic"

    This pattern is semi-generalizable because:
    - It's not so specific that it only applies to music
    - It's not so abstract that it applies to everything
    - It captures a recognizable path that many people walk

# ============================================
# RELATIONSHIP TO STORY COHERENCE
# ============================================

vs_narrative_structures:
  hero_journey:
    what_it_is: "Narrative arc with stages (call, threshold, ordeal, return)"
    why_not_goal_journey: |
      Hero's Journey describes EVENTS and their SEQUENCE.
      Goal journey describes GOALS and their SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS.

      Hero's Journey: "First the hero refuses the call, then accepts..."
      Goal journey: "This action serves this goal, which serves..."

      Different questions:
      - Narrative: What happens next?
      - Goal: What does this serve?

  when_narrative_matters: |
    Narrative structures are useful for TELLING stories about goal journeys.
    But the goal journey itself is not a narrative - it's a purpose chain.

    You might TELL the story of how someone discovered their goal journey
    using narrative structure. But the journey itself is the chain of goals.

    proper_form_note: |
      Notice this chain:
      - Each step is a verb phrase or clear outcome
      - No nouns used as steps ("Structures", "Decisions")
      - No adjectives used as steps ("Reliable", "Better")
      - Each service relationship is explicit
      - No steps skipped

    generalized_pattern: |
      Create tool → Provide guidance → Enable consistent process →
      Produce reliable outputs → Support decisions → Align actions →
      Achieve outcomes → [Intrinsic terminus]

    applies_to:
      - Any tool-building for decision support
      - Any process improvement effort
      - Any system designed to help people achieve goals

  example_4_different_termini:
    situation: "Same action, different people, different intrinsic goals"

    action: "Starting a business"

    person_A:
      chain:
        - "Start business"
        - "→ Generate income independent of employer"
        - "→ Control own schedule and decisions"
        - "→ Experience freedom from external constraints"
        - "→ FREEDOM (intrinsic)"
      terminus: Freedom

    person_B:
      chain:
        - "Start business"
        - "→ Build asset with predictable cash flow"
        - "→ Create financial buffer against uncertainty"
        - "→ Feel safe from economic volatility"
        - "→ SECURITY (intrinsic)"
      terminus: Security

    person_C:
      chain:
        - "Start business"
        - "→ Create something visible and measurable"
        - "→ Receive validation from customers and peers"
        - "→ Be seen as successful and capable"
        - "→ RECOGNITION (intrinsic)"
      terminus: Recognition

    key_insight: |
      Same action, three different intrinsic goals.
      Never assume "flourishing" or any single terminus.
      Use value elicitation to discover actual intrinsic goal.

  example_3_unsatisfying:
    situation: "Someone doing task they don't know why"

    goal_journey:
      action: "Filling out TPS reports"
      chain:
        - level: action
          description: "Completing the report"
          serves: "???"  # They don't know
        - level: ???
          description: "???"
          serves: "???"

    why_unsatisfying: |
      The chain doesn't connect to anything.
      The person can't see what goal this serves.
      There's no path to intrinsic value.

      This is why it feels meaningless - the goal journey
      is incomplete or absent.

    repair: |
      Either:
      1. Find the actual goal chain (maybe it exists but isn't visible)
      2. Realize there is no chain (task is actually pointless)
      3. Create a chain (find a way to make it serve something valued)

      Goal-structure reconstruction IS goal journey extraction.
      They're the same thing with different names.

      "Reconstructing the goal-structure" = "Extracting the goal journey"

  with_backward_reasoning:
    description: |
      Backward reasoning is the METHOD for extracting goal journeys.
      "What does this serve?" asked repeatedly = tracing the journey

  with_story_coherence_gate:
    description: |
      Story coherence checks if a goal journey is valid:
      - Connection = Each step serves the next
      - Legitimacy = Intrinsic goal is reasonable
      - Service = Conclusion serves the goals
      - Necessity = The journey was needed
      - Validity = This is a reasonable path

  with_honest_question_gate:
    description: |
      A question has an identifiable goal = its goal journey can be traced.
      If you can't trace the goal journey, the question may be
      unclear or pointless.
