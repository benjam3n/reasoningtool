description: |
  When you face a constraint that seems to block progress, NEVER give up.
  There is ALWAYS a workaround.

  CORE PHILOSOPHY:
  Most successful people started with constraints others would consider fatal.
  - No money → They found money or built without it
  - No authority → They got authority or used someone else's
  - No connections → They built connections
  - No skills → They learned or hired

  If people without plans can succeed despite constraints,
  a system WITH plans should completely dominate.

  The arbitrage is: we find workarounds they don't think to look for.

when_to_use:
  - You've identified a constraint that seems to block the goal
  - System is tempted to say "you can't do this because..."
  - Resource/authority/access gap seems insurmountable

  - resources
  - authority

inputs:
  - Goal being pursued
  - Constraint identified
  - Why constraint seems blocking

outputs:

  step_1_classify_constraint:
    description: What type of constraint is this?
    types:
      resource_lack:
        examples: ["No money", "No equipment", "No materials"]
        workaround_class: "acquire, substitute, or eliminate need"

        examples: ["No permission", "No position", "No credentials"]
        workaround_class: "acquire, borrow, or circumvent"

      knowledge_lack:
        examples: ["Don't know how", "No expertise", "No experience"]

        - "Build something target needs"
        - "Help target's priorities to earn reciprocity"
        - "Create public pressure/visibility"

        - "Partner with someone who has capability"
        - "Hire capability"
      redefine:
        - "Find approach that doesn't require capability"
        - "Change definition of success to match capabilities"
        - "Focus on different strength that achieves same outcome"

  step_3_evaluate_workarounds:
    description: Which workaround is most viable?
    criteria:
      - "Speed: How quickly can this workaround be implemented?"
      - "Cost: What resources does the workaround require?"
      - "Reliability: How likely is it to work?"
      - "Sustainability: Is this a one-time fix or ongoing solution?"
      - "Side effects: What new constraints might this create?"

  step_4_implement_workaround:
    description: Make the workaround part of the plan
    actions:
      - "Add workaround as explicit step in plan"
      - "Identify any NEW constraints the workaround creates"
      - "Apply this procedure recursively if needed"

examples:
  - constraint: "I have no money to start a business"
    workarounds_considered:
      - '"Get a job and save" (slow but reliable)'
      - '"Bootstrap with service business first" (earn while building)'
      - '"Raise from investors" (requires traction)'
      - '"Use free tools and sweat equity" (eliminates need)'
      - '"Partner with someone who has money" (borrow resources)'
    selected: "Bootstrap with service business → reinvest → build product"
    reasoning: "Creates cash flow while building toward goal; no external dependency"

  - constraint: "I don't have authority to change company policy"
    workarounds_considered:
      - "Get promoted to role with authority"
      - "Build coalition of peers to create pressure"
      - "Pilot change in your own area as proof of concept"
      - "Get executive sponsor who has authority"
      - "Leave and join/start company where you have authority"
    selected: "Pilot in own area → document results → get executive sponsor"
    reasoning: "Creates evidence that makes authority easier to acquire"

  - constraint: "I don't know anyone in the industry"
    workarounds_considered:
      - "Attend industry events"
      - "Create valuable content that attracts connections"
      - "Cold outreach with specific value proposition"
      - "Get warm intros through second-degree connections"
      - "Hire consultant who has connections"
    selected: "Create valuable content → builds reputation → connections come to you"
    reasoning: "Scalable, builds lasting asset, attracts right people"

  - constraint: "I don't have the skills to build this"
    workarounds_considered:
      - "Learn the skills (courses, practice)"
      - "Hire developer/contractor"
      - "Use no-code tools"
      - "Partner with technical co-founder"
      - "Start with simpler version I can build"
    selected: "Start with no-code MVP → validate → hire to rebuild properly"
    reasoning: "Fastest to validation; skill gap doesn't block progress"

anti_patterns:
  - "Accepting constraint as permanent blocker"
  - "Giving up because 'I don't have X'"
  - "Assuming current limitations are fixed"
  - "Not considering workarounds because they're harder than ideal path"
  - "Treating lack of resources as permission to not try"

philosophy: |
  CONSTRAINTS ARE CREATIVE FUEL, NOT BLOCKERS.

  Every successful person faced constraints others said were fatal.
  - "You don't have the background" → Built it
  - "You don't have the money" → Found it or built without it
  - "You don't have the connections" → Made them
  - "You don't have permission" → Got it or didn't need it

  The difference between success and failure is NOT having fewer constraints.
  It's finding workarounds others don't think to look for.

  YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
  You have a system for finding workarounds.
  Most people give up when they hit constraints.
  You don't give up. You find another way.

  This is the arbitrage.
