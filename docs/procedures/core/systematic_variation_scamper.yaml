intelligence_reduction: "80%"

goal: |
  Generate variations of an existing solution by systematically applying
  each transformation operation. No creativity needed - just apply
  each operation mechanically.

description: |
  SCAMPER is an acronym for 7 transformation operations:
  - Substitute
  - Combine
  - Adapt
  - Modify/Magnify/Minimize
  - Put to other uses
  - Eliminate
  - Reverse/Rearrange

  Apply each operation to generate variations, then evaluate.

when_to_use:
  - Improving existing solution
  - Generating alternatives
  - Breaking out of fixation on current approach
  - Brainstorming systematically
  - Innovation on existing product/process

      - "Combine with phone charger (wireless charging base)"
      - "Combine with temperature display"

    adapt:
      - "Adapt vacuum flask technology (insulation)"
      - "Adapt from baby bottles (spill-proof lid)"

    modify:
      - "Make it collapsible (travel)"
      - "Make it much larger (32oz)"
      - "Add weight to base (stability)"

      - "Use as pen holder"
      - "Use as plant pot"
      - "Use as soup bowl"

    eliminate:
      - "Remove handle entirely (Japanese style)"
      - "Remove fixed size (nesting mugs)"

    reverse:
      - "Reverse taper (wider at bottom)"
      - "Handle on inside (different grip)"

# VERIFICATION
# ============================================

verification:
  - "All 7 SCAMPER operations were applied"
  - "Each operation generated at least 2 variations"
  - "Variations are genuinely different from current solution"
