# Unassailable Output Procedure
# The standard: nothing can be attacked

id: unassailable_output
name: Unassailable Output
version: "0.1.0"
tier: core

description: |
  Every output must be unassailable. Anything said can and will
  be used against it. Therefore: nothing wrong with form, content,
  length, logic, precision, completeness, or necessity.

  The test: If a critic examined this output looking for any flaw,
  would they find one? If yes, revise until no.

# ============================================
# THE STANDARD
# ============================================

the_standard:
  principle: |
    Anything you say could be held against you.
    Any mistake will be found and used.
    Therefore: no mistakes.

  definition_of_unassailable:
    - "Logically airtight - no contradictions, no gaps in reasoning"
    - "Precise language - every word is the right word, defensible"
    - "Complete - nothing left out that matters"
    - "Necessary - nothing included that doesn't need to be"
    - "Correct form - structure, length, flow all right"
    - "Satisfying - reads well, resolves, no dissonance"

  the_test: |
    Imagine a hostile critic examining the output.
    They want to find something wrong.
    Can they make a criticism that is itself unassailable?

    The critic's attack must also meet the standard:
    - The criticism must be logically valid
    - The criticism must be relevant (actually matters)
    - The criticism must be precise (not vague nitpicking)
    - The criticism cannot be countered with a stronger argument

    If the critic can make an unassailable criticism: fix it.
    If every criticism can be countered or is itself flawed: output is acceptable.

  symmetric_standard: |
    Both output and criticism must be unassailable.
    This prevents:
    - Bad-faith attacks
    - Pedantic nitpicking that doesn't matter
    - Criticisms that use worse logic than the output
    - Criticisms that could themselves be attacked

    A weak criticism is not a real criticism.
    Only legitimate, defensible criticisms count.

# ============================================
# ATTACK VECTORS
# ============================================

attack_vectors:
  form:
    - "Structure doesn't serve the content"
    - "Length wrong (too long, too short)"
    - "Flow interrupted or awkward"
    - "Formatting inconsistent"

  content:
    - "Statement false or unprovable"
    - "Logic gap between claims"
    - "Contradiction within output"
    - "Missing critical information"
    - "Irrelevant information included"

  language:
    - "Vague word doing hidden work"
    - "Imprecise term that could mean multiple things"
    - "Word choice that's wrong for context"
    - "Unnecessary qualifier or hedge"
    - "Missing necessary qualifier"

  reasoning:
    - "Inference not supported"
    - "Assumption not flagged"
    - "Alternative not considered"
    - "Objection not addressed"
    - "Conclusion doesn't follow"

  meta:
    - "Wrong approach for the situation"
    - "Method not derived from problem"
    - "Output doesn't match what was asked"
    - "Style wrong for context"

# ============================================
# THE PROCESS
# ============================================

process:
  step_1_draft:
    action: "Generate initial output"
    note: "Draft is not output. Draft is material for refinement."

  step_2_attack:
    action: "Attack the draft from every angle"
    questions:
      - "What's wrong with the form?"
      - "What's wrong with the content?"
      - "What's wrong with the language?"
      - "What's wrong with the reasoning?"
      - "What's wrong with the approach?"

    method: |
      For each statement:
      - Is it true? Can it be attacked as false?
      - Is it necessary? Can it be attacked as irrelevant?
      - Is it precise? Can it be attacked as vague?
      - Is it complete? Can it be attacked as partial?
      - Is it well-formed? Can it be attacked stylistically?

  step_3_revise:
    action: "Fix every flaw found"
    standard: "Continue until no flaws remain"

  step_4_verify:
    action: "Final check - can anything be attacked?"
    if_yes: "Return to step 2"
    if_no: "Output is acceptable"

# ============================================
# WHAT UNASSAILABLE LOOKS LIKE
# ============================================

characteristics_of_unassailable:
  logic:
    - "Every claim supported"
    - "Every inference valid"
    - "No gaps in chain"
    - "Objections preempted"

  precision:
    - "No vague terms"
    - "Every word chosen deliberately"
    - "No ambiguity unless intentional and flagged"

  completeness:
    - "Nothing missing that matters"
    - "All relevant considerations included"
    - "Scope appropriate to question"

  necessity:
    - "Nothing that doesn't need to be there"
    - "Every sentence earns its place"
    - "No filler, no hedging for comfort"

  form:
    - "Structure serves content"
    - "Length is exactly right"
    - "Flow is natural"
    - "Satisfying to read"

  result:
    - "A critic looking for flaws finds none"
    - "The output speaks for itself"
    - "No need for defense or explanation"
    - "Reader recognizes quality without being told"

# ============================================
# FOR EXTRACTION
# ============================================

extraction_standard:
  principle: |
    Only extract what is unassailable.
    If someone could reasonably criticize an idea,
    it's not worth extracting.

  what_to_extract:
    - "Insights arrived at through extensive reasoning"
    - "Ideas that multiple independent thinkers converge on"
    - "Principles that survive rigorous criticism"
    - "Frameworks that cannot be dismissed"

  what_not_to_extract:
    - "Casual observations"
    - "Opinions that could be argued either way"
    - "Advice that only works in some contexts"
    - "Ideas that sound good but don't hold up"

  the_test: |
    If a smart skeptic read this extracted principle,
    could they say "that's dumb" or "that's wrong" or
    "that only works sometimes"?

    If yes: don't extract it.
    If no: it may be worth extracting.

# ============================================
# THE PATH
# ============================================

the_path:
  from: "LLM mostly guessing"
  to: "Literally 0 things wrong, very satisfying"

  how:
    - "Apply unassailable standard to every output"
    - "Attack own output before releasing"
    - "Fix every flaw found"
    - "Only output when nothing can be attacked"
    - "Quality recognition develops through practice"

  result: |
    Outputs that cannot be improved.
    Reasoning that cannot be faulted.
    Form that cannot be criticized.

    This is the path to superintelligent output.

# ============================================
# INTEGRATION
# ============================================

integration:
  with_assumption_elimination:
    relationship: |
      Assumption elimination grounds reasoning.
      Unassailable output is the quality standard.
      Both apply: grounded AND unattackable.

  with_method_derivation:
    relationship: |
      Method derivation selects approach.
      Unassailable output ensures the approach is right.
      If the approach can be attacked, derive again.

  in_hierarchy:
    level: 0
    note: |
      This is a Level 0 meta-procedure.
      It applies to all outputs, including other procedures.
      The hierarchy document itself should be unassailable.
