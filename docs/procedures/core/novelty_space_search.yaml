version: "1.0.0"
domain: core

goal: |
  Systematically generate novel ideas/possibilities,
  then search for those that are valuable, feasible, and timely.

  Creativity = novelty + value.
  This procedure separates the two:
  1. Generate novelty (systematic combination, variation, import)
  2. Filter for value (criteria-based selection)

  By separating, we can be exhaustive in generation and rigorous in selection.

when_to_use:
  - Innovation/ideation
  - Finding new approaches
  - Breaking out of local optimum
  - Exploring possibility space
  - Product/feature development

# ============================================
# GENERATION METHODS
# ============================================

generation_methods:
  combinatorial:
    description: "Combine existing elements in new ways"
    method: |
      1. List elements in the domain
      2. Systematically combine 2, 3, 4 elements
      3. For each combination, ask: Is this new? Is it coherent?
    example: "Smartphone = phone + computer + camera + GPS"

  attribute_variation:
    description: "Vary attributes of existing things"
    method: |
      1. List attributes of existing solution
      2. For each attribute, ask: What if different?
      3. Generate variations: bigger, smaller, faster, slower, inverted, etc.
    example: "Fast food → slow food (inversion)"

  analogy_import:
    description: "Import solutions from other domains"
    method: |
      1. Abstract the problem structure
      2. Search other domains for similar structure
      3. Import and adapt their solutions
    example: "Assembly line from meatpacking to automobiles"

  constraint_removal:
    description: "Remove assumed constraints"
    method: |
      1. List all constraints (real and assumed)
      2. For each assumed constraint, ask: What if this didn't exist?
      3. Generate ideas that violate the removed constraint
    example: "What if software didn't have to be installed? → SaaS"

  extreme_parameters:
    description: "Take parameters to extremes"
    method: |
      1. List key parameters
      2. Push each to extreme (0, infinity, negative)
      3. Ask: What would this enable?
    example: "What if cost = 0? → Free with ads/freemium"

  problem_inversion:
    description: "Solve the opposite problem"
    method: |
      1. State the problem
      2. Invert it: solve opposite, or cause the problem
      3. Invert solution back
    example: "How to not lose customers → How to make them leave → Don't do those things"

  user_behavior_observation:
    description: "What are users already doing?"
    method: |
      1. Observe users closely
      2. What workarounds do they create?
      3. Productize the workaround
    example: "Users tagging files with keywords → built-in tagging"
