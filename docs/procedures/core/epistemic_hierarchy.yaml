description: |
  A layered framework for building from certain foundations toward determinate action.
  Each level provides different certainty and different utility.

  The hierarchy:
  - Level 0: Undeniable certainties (experience exists)
  - Level 1: Pragmatic necessities (invariant across metaphysical views)
  - Level 1.5: Ethical constraints (hard to reject without incoherence)
  - Level 2: Empirical regularities (contingent but testable)
  - Level 3: Situation-specific derivations (from above + specifics)

core_insight: |
  You can't derive action from nothing. But you can build from what's certain,
  through what's pragmatically necessary, constrained by ethics, informed by
  evidence, to specific action. Each level has different certainty.

when_to_use:
  - When grounding axioms for deductive strategy
  - When determining certainty level of premises
  - When asking "how do I know this?"
  - When building RCI chains that reach foundational questions
  - When distinguishing solid ground from assumptions

# ============================================
# LEVEL 0: WHAT IS CERTAIN
# ============================================

level_0:
  name: Certain Foundations
  description: Undeniable truths. Denying them is self-refuting.

  undeniable:
    - name: Experience exists
      description: Something is happening. Denying this is self-refuting.
      status: Cannot be coherently denied

    - name: This present moment exists
      description: The current experience is occurring.
      status: Cannot be coherently denied

  highly_certain:
    - name: Structure exists
      description: Not just undifferentiated "something" but patterns, distinctions.
      status: Denial seems incoherent given structure of denial itself

    - name: Change exists
      description: Experience is not static.
      status: Denial seems incoherent given experience of denying

    - name: Memory exists
      description: Or at least the appearance of memory within experience.
      status: Denial seems incoherent given structure of thought

  inference_required:
    - name: The past existed
      note: Inferred from memory, but memory could be constructed
      status: Strong inference but not undeniable

    - name: The future will exist
      note: Inferred from pattern, but pattern could break
      status: Strong inference but not undeniable

    - name: Other minds exist
      note: Inferred from behavior, could be philosophical zombies
      status: Reasonable inference but philosophically contestable

    - name: External world exists
      note: Inferred from structure, could be simulation/dream
      status: Reasonable inference but philosophically contestable

  theoretical_posit:
    - name: Physical objects exist independent of observation
      status: Useful assumption, philosophically contested

    - name: Causation exists (not just correlation)
      status: Useful assumption, philosophically contested

    - name: Laws of nature exist (not just regularities)
      status: Useful assumption, philosophically contested

# ============================================
# LEVEL 1: PRAGMATIC NECESSITIES
# ============================================

level_1:
  name: Pragmatic Necessities
  description: |
    If certainty is limited to Level 0, and everything needed to act (external
    world, other minds, future, causation, values) is uncertain, how do we act?

    These are invariants across major metaphysical possibilities. Whether or not
    the external world is "real," modeling regularities works. Whether or not
    other minds exist, reducing apparent-suffering matters.

  core_pragmatic_necessities:

    - name: Model regularities in experience
      reasoning: |
        Whether external world exists or not, modeling regularities works
        within whatever system you're embedded in.
      applies: Always

    - name: Act as if actions influence subsequent experience
      reasoning: |
        Whether or not "causation" is real, the correlation between actions
        and subsequent experiences holds. Acting on this is necessary.
      applies: Always

    - name: Reduce apparent-suffering in experience
      reasoning: |
        Whether or not other minds exist, apparent-suffering appears in
        experience. Reducing it might be instrumentally or intrinsically
        valuable regardless of metaphysical truth.
      applies: Always

    - name: Act coherently with own preferences
      reasoning: |
        Whether or not values are objective, you have preferences. Acting
        against them is incoherent from your own perspective.
      applies: Always

  invariance_analysis:

    other_minds:
      if_exist: Their suffering matters; consider their interests
      if_not_exist: Apparent-suffering still appears in experience; reducing it still matters
      invariant: Reducing apparent-suffering is valuable either way

    external_world:
      if_exists: Physical actions have real consequences
      if_not_exists: Actions still have consequences within the simulation/dream
      invariant: Accurate modeling works within the system you're embedded in

    future:
      if_exists: Actions affect future states
      if_not_exists: Current actions still correlate with subsequent experiences
      invariant: Acting as if actions influence subsequent experience is pragmatically necessary

    objective_values:
      if_exist: Discover and act on them
      if_not_exist: You still have preferences that motivate action
      invariant: Acting against your own preferences is incoherent

# ============================================
# LEVEL 1.5: ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS
# ============================================

level_1_5:
  name: Ethical Constraints
  description: |
    Hard to reject without incoherence. Not certain, but defensible.
    These don't determine a unique ethics but rule out a lot.

  core_constraints:

    - name: Non-contradiction
      description: Can't hold X and not-X
      implication: Ethical views can't contradict themselves
      hard_to_reject: Rejecting it requires holding contradictions

    - name: Means-end coherence
      description: If I want Y and X is necessary for Y, I have reason to X
      implication: Instrumental rationality is binding given goals
      hard_to_reject: Rejecting it means wanting Y but not wanting means to Y

    - name: Preference satisfaction (self)
      description: Acting against my own preferences is prima facie bad for me
      implication: My preferences generate reasons for action
      open_question: Which preferences - current, informed, or idealized?

    - name: Suffering matters (prima facie)
      description: Hard to deny that suffering provides some reason for action
      implication: Have some reason to reduce suffering
      open_question: How much reason? How does it weigh against other things?

    - name: Universalizability (weak form)
      description: If I can't state a relevant difference, similar cases should be treated similarly
      implication: Can't make arbitrary exceptions for myself
      hard_to_reject: Rejecting requires accepting arbitrary inconsistency

  defensible_space:
    concept: |
      There's no unique "correct action" to derive. There's a space of
      "defensible actions" and a larger space of "indefensible actions."
      The goal isn't to find THE answer but to stay within the defensible space.

    indefensible:
      - Contradicting yourself
      - Wanting ends but not means
      - Acting against your own preferences for no reason
      - Treating suffering as if it doesn't matter at all
      - Making arbitrary exceptions for yourself

# ============================================
# LEVEL 3: SITUATION-SPECIFIC
# ============================================

level_3:
  name: Situation-Specific Derivation
  description: |
    Derived from Level 0-2 plus specific situation facts.
    This is where action determination happens.

  derivation_formula: |
    This situation + these regularities + these preferences → this action

  components:
    - Level 0-1.5 constraints (must not violate)
    - Level 2 empirical regularities (best available)
    - Situation-specific facts (current state)
    - Preferences (what matters to you)
    - Available actions (what's possible)

  quality_criteria:
    good_action:
      - Not violating Level 0-1.5 constraints
      - Using best-available Level 2 knowledge
      - Making remaining choices consciously rather than by default
      - Acknowledging uncertainty where it exists

    bad_action:
      - Contradicting yourself
      - Ignoring regularities
      - Pretending certainty you don't have
      - Making choices unconsciously

# ============================================
# USING THE HIERARCHY
# ============================================

usage:

  for_rci:
    description: When RCI chains reach foundational questions
    process:
      - Identify which level the question operates at
      - Level 0-1 → Metaphysics, epistemology
      - Level 1.5 → Ethics, axiology
      - Level 2 → Empirical questions
      - Level 3 → Applied questions
    then: Use higher levels to constrain lower levels

  for_deductive_strategy:
    description: When identifying axioms for derivation
    process:
      - Level 0 claims can be used as axioms (certain)
      - Level 1 claims can be used pragmatically (invariant)
      - Level 1.5 claims constrain ethical space (defensible)
      - Level 2 claims are empirical premises (testable)
      - Level 3 conclusions are derived
    confidence_guidance:
      level_0: Treat as axioms - denial is self-refuting
      level_1: Treat as pragmatic axioms - invariant across metaphysical views
      level_1_5: Treat as constraints - defensible, hard to reject coherently
      level_2: Treat as empirical premises - require support, vary by domain stability
      level_3: Treat as derived - quality depends on premise quality and reasoning validity

  for_assumption_register:
    description: When tracking assumptions
    process:
      - Classify each assumption by level
      - Level 0-1 assumptions are nearly certain
      - Level 1.5 assumptions require ethical justification
      - Level 2 assumptions require empirical support
      - Level 3 assumptions are derived (check derivation)

# INTEGRATION WITH GOSM
# ============================================

gosm_integration:
  rci_connection: |
    RCI chains often terminate at foundational questions (Level 0-1.5).
    The epistemic hierarchy tells you which level you've reached and
    what kind of certainty you can expect.

  deductive_strategy_connection: |
    Deductive derivation needs axioms. The epistemic hierarchy provides
    the certainty levels for premises at each level. Level 0 premises
    are solid axioms. Level 2 premises are empirical and require support.

  assumption_register_connection: |
    Assumptions can be classified by level. This determines how much
    verification they need and what kind of verification applies.
