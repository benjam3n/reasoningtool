# Goal-Structure Reconstruction Procedure
# The core method for understanding any conclusion by tracing backward to its foundational goals

id: goal_structure_reconstruction
name: Goal-Structure Reconstruction
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core
tier: platinum

description: |
  Given any conclusion, statement, or claim, reconstruct the goal-structure
  (the "story") that led to it. This reveals WHY the conclusion exists,
  enabling evaluation of purpose rather than just logic.

core_insight: |
  Every conclusion is the last step of a journey. Without knowing the journey,
  the conclusion is just a statement - hard to evaluate. With the journey known,
  we can evaluate whether the journey was necessary, whether this was the right
  path, and whether the destination was worth reaching.

when_to_use:
  - Evaluating philosophical claims or foundations
  - Understanding why someone made a statement
  - Finding the purpose behind a criticism
  - Determining if a conclusion is meaningful or arbitrary
  - Terminating n+1 regress by reaching intrinsic goals

# ============================================
# THE METHOD
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Identify the conclusion
    action: |
      State the conclusion, claim, or statement to be reconstructed.

      Be precise. The exact wording matters.
    output: conclusion_statement

  - id: 2
    name: Ask "What goal does this serve?"
    action: |
      What is the IMMEDIATE goal of this statement?
      Not assumptions, not implications - the GOAL.

      What state is the speaker trying to bring about?
      What need is this serving?
    output: immediate_goal

  - id: 3
    name: Ask "What goal led to pursuing that goal?"
    action: |
      Why pursue the immediate goal?
      What deeper need does achieving that goal serve?

      Continue asking until you reach either:
      - An intrinsic goal (valued for itself)
      - A practical necessity (required for functioning)
      - A transcendental condition (required for any goal-pursuit)
    output: goal_chain

  - id: 4
    name: Map the story
    action: |
      Organize the goal chain as a "story" with chapters:

      Chapter 1: The foundational/intrinsic goal
      Chapter 2: What problem or need arises from that goal
      Chapter 3: What approach addresses that problem
      ...
      Final Chapter: The conclusion

      Each chapter should connect to the next.
    output: story_structure

  - id: 5
    name: Evaluate the story
    action: |
      Ask of the story:

      1. Does it cohere? (Do the chapters connect logically?)
      2. Are the goals legitimate? (Would reasonable people share them?)
      3. Does the conclusion serve the goals? (Does the ending fit?)
      4. Is this the best way? (Are there better paths to the same goal?)
      5. Was the journey necessary? (Did the goal need pursuing at all?)
    output: evaluation

# ============================================
# GOAL TYPES
# ============================================

goal_types:
  intrinsic:
    description: Valued for itself, not for what it leads to
    examples:
      - Wellbeing/flourishing
      - Pleasure
      - Knowledge (for some)
      - Connection (for some)
      - Meaning/purpose
    termination: |
      Intrinsic goals are like "chapter 1" - you don't ask what came before.
      They're the POINT. The regress of "why?" terminates here.

  instrumental:
    description: Valued for what it leads to
    examples:
      - Money (leads to security, options)
      - Credentials (leads to opportunities)
      - Tools (leads to capabilities)
    termination: |
      Instrumental goals don't terminate regress - keep asking "why?"
      until you reach the intrinsic goal being served.

  practical_necessity:
    description: Required for functioning regardless of specific goals
    examples:
      - Food/water (biological necessity)
      - Communication (social necessity)
      - Reasoning (epistemic necessity)
    termination: |
      Practical necessities terminate regress because denying them
      makes functioning impossible. Not arbitrary - required.

  transcendental:
    description: Required for any goal-pursuit to be possible
    examples:
      - Experience exists
      - Structure exists
      - Some things can be distinguished from others
    termination: |
      Transcendental conditions terminate regress because denying them
      is self-undermining. They're preconditions for the activity of
      having goals at all.

# ============================================
# EXAMPLE APPLICATION
# ============================================

example:
  target: "Better reasoning should beat worse reasoning"

  step_1_conclusion: "Better reasoning should beat worse reasoning"

  step_2_immediate_goal: |
    Provide a criterion for accepting/rejecting arguments.
    Enable discrimination between arguments.

  step_3_goal_chain:
    - goal: Discriminate between arguments
      why: So we can accept good ones and reject bad ones
    - goal: Accept good arguments, reject bad ones
      why: So our beliefs are well-supported
    - goal: Well-supported beliefs
      why: So our decisions are well-founded
    - goal: Well-founded decisions
      why: So our actions are effective
    - goal: Effective actions
      why: So we achieve wellbeing/flourishing
    - goal: Wellbeing/flourishing
      why: (intrinsic - valued for itself)

  step_4_story:
    chapter_1: We value wellbeing (intrinsic goal)
    chapter_2: Wellbeing requires effective action (necessity)
    chapter_3: Effective action requires good decisions (derivation)
    chapter_4: Good decisions require well-supported beliefs (derivation)
    chapter_5: Well-supported beliefs require discriminating arguments (derivation)
    chapter_6: '"Better reasoning beats worse reasoning" (conclusion)'

  step_5_evaluation:
    coherence: Yes - each chapter connects to the next
    goals_legitimate: Yes - wellbeing is reasonable intrinsic goal
    conclusion_serves_goals: Yes - the criterion enables the chain
    best_way: Maybe not only way, but valid
    journey_necessary: Yes - if you want wellbeing, this chain is needed

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO N+1
# ============================================

n_plus_1_connection: |
  Goal-structure reconstruction addresses n+1 because:

  1. The regress of "why?" terminates at intrinsic goals
     - "Why X?" "To achieve Y." "Why Y?" ... "Because I value Z intrinsically."
     - Intrinsic values don't have a "because" - they're the point.

  2. The story structure provides bounded inquiry
     - A story has a beginning (chapter 1 = foundational goal)
     - You don't ask "what came before chapter 1?"
     - The story defines its scope

  3. Goals enable evaluation of criticisms
     - "What goal does this criticism serve?"
     - If no legitimate goal, the criticism is noise
     - If legitimate goal, address it within that scope

# ============================================
# GOAL UNDERSTANDING PIPELINE
# ============================================
# This procedure is STEP 2 of the goal understanding pipeline:
#
#   1. recursive_causal_interrogation
#      → Question the framing, trace causes of the goal statement
#      → Output: Clearer understanding of what's actually being sought
#
#   2. goal_structure_reconstruction (THIS)
#      → Trace goal chain: action → goal → goal → intrinsic goal
#      → Output: The "story" of why this goal matters
#
#   3. backward_reasoning
#      → Given conclusions, trace back to premises
#      → Output: Understanding of what journey led here
#
#   4. deductive_strategy_discovery
#      → Derive strategies from problem structure
#      → Output: Strategies native to the actual situation
#
# Use GSR after RCI when you have a clearer goal and want to trace
# the full chain to intrinsic goals.

  when_to_use_this_step: |
    Use after RCI when:
    - Goal is clarified but chain to intrinsic goals unclear
    - You need to understand WHY this goal matters
    - You want to evaluate whether the goal is worth pursuing
    - You need to find where the regress terminates
