# Bounded Inquiry Procedure
# Structures inquiry with explicit boundaries to enable termination

id: bounded_inquiry
name: Bounded Inquiry
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core
tier: platinum

description: |
  Unbounded inquiry cannot terminate - every answer opens new questions.
  Bounded inquiry can terminate - closure is possible within scope.

  This procedure establishes explicit boundaries for any inquiry,
  enabling satisfying closure rather than infinite regress.

core_insight: |
  Satisfaction comes from closure within boundaries.

  The unsatisfying feeling of infinite regress comes from UNBOUNDED inquiry.
  If inquiry has no boundaries, every answer opens new questions.
  If inquiry has boundaries, answers within boundaries provide closure.

# ============================================
# WHAT PROVIDES BOUNDARIES
# ============================================

boundary_types:
  goals:
    description: What we're trying to achieve
    function: Defines what "success" means
    example: '"Understand how X works" vs "Understand everything"'
    unbounded_symptom: No clear success criterion

  scope:
    description: What we're asking about
    function: Defines what's in/out of bounds
    example: '"How does this code work?" vs "How does everything work?"'
    unbounded_symptom: Everything is fair game

  rules:
    description: How we're conducting inquiry
    function: Defines valid moves
    example: '"Using logic and evidence" vs "Anything goes"'
    unbounded_symptom: No standard for accepting/rejecting

  stakes:
    description: Why we need to terminate
    function: Creates practical pressure for closure
    example: '"Need to decide by Friday" vs "No deadline"'
    unbounded_symptom: No cost to continuing forever

# ============================================
# THE PROCEDURE
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Establish goal boundary
    action: |
      Before beginning inquiry, explicitly state:
      - What are we trying to achieve?
      - What would count as success?
      - What would this achievement enable?

      Be specific. "Understand X" is too vague.
      "Be able to predict Y given Z" is specific.
    output: goal_statement

  - id: 2
    name: Establish scope boundary
    action: |
      Explicitly state:
      - What is IN scope for this inquiry?
      - What is OUT of scope?
      - Where are the edges?

      Questions outside scope are acknowledged but deferred:
      "That's outside this inquiry. We can address it separately."
    output: scope_definition

  - id: 3
    name: Establish rules boundary
    action: |
      Explicitly state:
      - What counts as valid reasoning here?
      - What evidence standards apply?
      - What would we accept as an answer?

      This prevents moving goalposts and endless "but what if?"
    output: rules_definition

  - id: 4
    name: Establish stakes boundary
    action: |
      Explicitly state:
      - Why does this inquiry matter?
      - What depends on its completion?
      - What's the cost of not terminating?

      If there are no stakes, ask: Why are we doing this?
    output: stakes_definition

  - id: 5
    name: Conduct inquiry within boundaries
    action: |
      Pursue the inquiry, but check against boundaries:
      - Is this question within scope?
      - Does this answer serve the goal?
      - Does this reasoning follow the rules?
      - Are we respecting the stakes?

      Out-of-scope questions: Acknowledge and defer.
      Goal-irrelevant tangents: Note and return.
      Rule-violating moves: Reject or flag.
    output: inquiry_process

  - id: 6
    name: Recognize termination
    action: |
      Inquiry terminates when:
      - Goal is achieved (success)
      - Goal is shown unachievable within scope (bounded failure)
      - Stakes require decision now (practical closure)
      - Remaining questions are out of scope (scoped completion)

      State the termination explicitly:
      "This inquiry is complete because [criterion]."
    output: termination_statement

# ============================================
# HANDLING BOUNDARY CHALLENGES
# ============================================

boundary_challenges:
  challenge_1:
    type: "Why these boundaries?"
    description: Someone questions the boundaries themselves
    response: |
      Questioning boundaries is DIFFERENT inquiry from the current one.
      "Should these be the boundaries?" is meta-inquiry.

      Options:
      1. Note and defer: "We can discuss boundaries after this inquiry."
      2. Suspend and address: "Let's establish boundaries first, then inquire."
      3. Acknowledge legitimacy: "That's a valid meta-question, but not this inquiry."

  challenge_2:
    type: "But what about...?"
    description: Someone raises out-of-scope question
    response: |
      Acknowledge and defer:
      "That's outside our current scope. We're focused on [scope].
       We can address that in a separate inquiry."

      Don't expand scope mid-inquiry unless there's good reason.

  challenge_3:
    type: "I don't accept your rules"
    description: Someone rejects the rules of inquiry
    response: |
      Rules disagreement is a boundary disagreement.
      Either:
      1. Negotiate rules before continuing
      2. Acknowledge the disagreement and proceed with stated rules
      3. Recognize that inquiry can't proceed without shared rules

  challenge_4:
    type: "There are no stakes"
    description: Inquiry seems to have no practical import
    response: |
      If genuinely no stakes, ask: Why do this inquiry?
      Possible answers:
      - Intellectual pleasure (intrinsic stake)
      - Future applicability (deferred stake)
      - Practice (skill-building stake)

      If no answer, maybe the inquiry isn't needed.

# ============================================
# EXAMPLES
# ============================================

examples:
  example_1:
    inquiry: "How do I fix this bug?"
    goal: Make the code work correctly
    scope: This specific bug, this codebase
    rules: Standard debugging (reproduce, isolate, fix, verify)
    stakes: Feature needs to ship
    termination: Bug is fixed and verified

  example_2:
    inquiry: "What is consciousness?"
    goal: Have a working model of consciousness
    scope: Phenomenal consciousness, not all mental phenomena
    rules: Philosophical argument, empirical evidence from neuroscience
    stakes: Intellectual understanding (intrinsic value)
    termination: |
      Have a model that:
      - Accounts for key features (qualia, unity, etc.)
      - Is consistent with evidence
      - Makes testable predictions
      Note: May terminate at "best current model" not "final answer"

  example_3:
    inquiry: "How should I live?"
    goal: Have practical guidance for decisions
    scope: My life, my values, my circumstances
    rules: Reflection, coherence with values, practical feasibility
    stakes: Quality of life
    termination: |
      Have principles that:
      - Reflect my values
      - Provide guidance in common situations
      - Can be refined with experience
      Note: Not "final answer" but "working answer"

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO N+1
# ============================================

n_plus_1_connection: |
  Bounded inquiry addresses n+1 by:

  1. Scope boundary: "Why?" questions outside scope are deferred
  2. Goal boundary: Once goal is achieved, no need to continue
  3. Rules boundary: Moves that violate rules don't count
  4. Stakes boundary: At some point, must decide/act

  The regress continues only WITHIN boundaries. Boundaries make closure possible.

# ============================================
# THE GAME METAPHOR
# ============================================

game_metaphor: |
  Inquiry is like a game:
  - Games have rules (what's valid)
  - Rules define what's in bounds
  - Winning = achieving goal within rules
  - You don't ask "why these rules?" while playing
  - You can question rules before/after, but that's a different game

  Questioning the rules of inquiry ISN'T PART of the inquiry.
  It's meta-inquiry. Recognize the level shift.
