goal: |
  Systematically identify hidden assumptions in a plan, belief, or
  strategy using structured prompts. Prompts do most of the work;
  recognition requires some insight.

description: |
  Plans and beliefs rest on assumptions that are often invisible.
  These hidden assumptions can cause spectacular failures when violated.
  This procedure uses systematic prompts to surface assumptions that
  would otherwise remain hidden.

when_to_use:
  - Before committing to a plan
  - When a strategy seems too good
  - When there's unexpected disagreement
  - When adapting a solution to new context
  - To stress-test thinking

inputs:
  - name: subject
    type: description
    description: "The plan, belief, or strategy being examined"

outputs:
  - name: assumptions
    type: list
    description: "All identified assumptions"
  - name: critical_assumptions
    type: list
    description: "Assumptions that, if wrong, would invalidate the subject"

# ============================================
# PROCEDURE STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: "State the Subject"
    action: |
      Clearly describe the plan, belief, or strategy being examined.
      Be specific about what it claims or proposes.
    output: "Subject description"

  - id: 2
    name: "Apply Assumption Prompts"
    action: |
      Go through each category of prompts systematically.
      For each prompt, ask: "What am I assuming about this?"
      Record all assumptions, even obvious ones.
    output: "Raw assumption list"

  - id: 3
    name: "Consolidate and Deduplicate"
    action: |
      Combine similar assumptions.
      Remove true duplicates.
      Clarify vague assumptions.
    output: "Clean assumption list"

  - id: 4
    name: "Assess Criticality"
    action: |
      For each assumption, ask:
      "If this assumption is wrong, does the plan still work?"

      Critical = Plan fails if assumption is wrong
      Important = Plan degraded if wrong
      Minor = Doesn't significantly affect plan
    output: "Prioritized assumptions"
    template: |
      CRITICAL (plan fails if wrong):
      - [Assumption 1]
      - [Assumption 2]

      IMPORTANT (plan degraded if wrong):
      - [Assumption 3]
      - [Assumption 4]

      MINOR:
      - [Assumption 5]

  - id: 5
    name: "Assess Confidence"
    action: |
      For each critical assumption:
      - How confident are you it's true?
      - What's the evidence?
      - Has it been tested?

      High risk = Critical + Low confidence
    output: "Confidence assessment"
    template: |
      ASSUMPTION: [Description]
      Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
      Evidence: [What supports it]
      Tested: [Yes/No/Partially]
      Risk: [High/Medium/Low]

  - id: 6
    name: "Plan Validation"
    action: |
      For high-risk assumptions (critical + low confidence):
      - How could you test this?
      - What would prove it wrong?
      - What's the cheapest test?
    output: "Validation plan"
    template: |
      ASSUMPTION: [Description]
      Test: [How to validate]
      Disproof: [What would show it's wrong]
      Cost: [Resources needed to test]
      Timeline: [When to test]

  - id: 7
    name: "Consider Alternatives"
    action: |
      For each critical assumption:
      "If this is wrong, what's the alternative plan?"
      Having contingencies reduces risk.
    output: "Contingency plans"
