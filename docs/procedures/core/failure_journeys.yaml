  Most goal journey work focuses on SUCCESS paths.
  But failure is ALSO a goal people pursue.

  This isn't just "anti-flourishing" in the simple sense (one-time destruction).
  It's the sophisticated patterns of SUSTAINABLE FAILURE - failing in ways
  that allow continued failing.

  Many stories already map these patterns:
  - Tragedies
  - Noir
  - Addiction narratives
  - Self-sabotage arcs
  - "Almost but never quite" stories

  A complete goal journey system must include failure journeys.

core_insight: |
  There's a crucial difference between:

  LEVEL 1 - Terminal Failure:
    Delete the project. Blow it all up. One-time catastrophic failure.
    This ENDS the game. Can start fresh. Actually opens possibilities.

  LEVEL 2 - Sustainable Failure:
    Fail in a way that keeps you failing.
    Never quite catastrophically (which would force reset).
    Never quite succeeding (which would end the failure).
    PERPETUATES the state.

  LEVEL 3 - Strategic Suboptimization:
    Keep self/others in "good enough to continue, bad enough to never succeed."
    Prevents backward thinking.
    Prevents opening new possibilities.
    Maintains the trap.

  The sophisticated failure isn't the explosion - it's the slow leak.

# ============================================
# WHY PEOPLE PURSUE FAILURE
# ============================================

why_failure_is_pursued:
  note: |
    These are VALID intrinsic goals for some people.
    Not pathology to be fixed - patterns to be understood.

  reasons:
    identity_maintenance:
      description: "Failure is who I am"
      mechanism: |
        If I succeed, I lose my identity as the struggling one.
        Failure confirms my self-concept.
        Success would require becoming someone else.
      intrinsic_goal: Identity / Continuity of self

    connection_through_struggle:
      description: "Failure connects me to others"
      mechanism: |
        Being helped, receiving sympathy, being the one who needs support.
        Success might mean losing those connections.
        The struggle IS the relationship.
      intrinsic_goal: Connection (via asymmetric help)

    fear_of_success:
      description: "What happens after I succeed?"
      mechanism: |
        Success brings new responsibilities, expectations, visibility.
        Failure is familiar. Success is unknown territory.
        Stay in the known.
      intrinsic_goal: Security / Predictability

    avoiding_finality:
      description: "As long as I'm failing, I'm still playing"
      mechanism: |
        Success ends the game. Failure keeps it going.
        "What if I succeed and it's not what I wanted?"
        Perpetual failure = perpetual possibility (paradoxically)
      intrinsic_goal: Possibility / Optionality

    victimhood_as_power:
      description: "Being wronged gives me moral authority"
      mechanism: |
        The victim has grievance. Grievance is leverage.
        Success would mean losing the grievance.
        Stay wronged, stay powerful (in a specific way).
      intrinsic_goal: Power (via moral positioning)

    responsibility_avoidance:
      description: "Can't be held responsible if I never succeed"
      mechanism: |
        Success brings accountability.
        "I tried but couldn't" vs "I did and it failed."
        Never quite succeeding means never quite being responsible.
      intrinsic_goal: Safety from judgment

    comfort_in_struggle:
      description: "I know how to struggle. I don't know how to thrive."
      mechanism: |
        Struggle has become the comfort zone.
        Skills are calibrated for surviving, not thriving.
        Success would require new skills.
      intrinsic_goal: Competence (in struggle)

# ============================================
# FAILURE JOURNEY TYPES
# ============================================

failure_types:
  terminal_failure:
    level: 1
    name: "Catastrophic / Terminal Failure"
    description: "Complete destruction. Game ends. Can start fresh."
    pattern: |
      Action → Total failure → End
    examples:
      - "Delete the project entirely"
      - "Burn bridges completely"
      - "Quit and walk away"
    characteristics:
      - One-time event
      - Actually opens new possibilities
      - Forces reset / backward thinking
      - Ends the current game
    paradox: |
      Terminal failure is actually LESS effective at keeping you failing
      because it forces a reset. You might start over and succeed.
      This is why it's Level 1 - it's the naive approach to failure.

  sustainable_failure:
    level: 2
    name: "Sustainable / Continuous Failure"
    description: "Fail in a way that enables continued failing."
    pattern: |
      Action → Partial failure → Not quite bad enough to reset →
      Continue → Partial failure → Loop
    examples:
      - "Almost finish project, then let it stall indefinitely"
      - "Get close to deadline, then miss it, but not so badly that you're fired"
      - "Make progress, then introduce problem, maintain struggle"
    characteristics:
      - Perpetuating state, not achieving outcome
      - Never quite catastrophic
      - Never quite successful
      - Self-sustaining loop
    key_insight: |
      The goal is to STAY FAILING, not to ACHIEVE FAILURE.
      Achieving failure (terminal) ends the game.
      Staying failing keeps the game going.

  strategic_suboptimization:
    level: 3
    name: "Strategic Suboptimization / Semi-Sabotage"
    description: "Maintain self/others in 'good enough but never great' state."
    pattern: |
      Action → Some success → Cap it → Prevent more success →
      Maintain suboptimal state → Prevent reset thinking
    examples:
      - "Keep employee just satisfied enough not to quit, never promoted"
      - "Keep competitor alive but weakened - don't destroy completely"
      - "Keep yourself busy enough to feel productive, never accomplishing"
    characteristics:
      - Prevents backward thinking
      - Prevents opening new possibilities
      - Maintains the trap
      - Looks like effort from outside
    key_insight: |
      Complete destruction would allow the target to start fresh.
      Fresh starts enable new thinking.
      Suboptimization keeps them on a path going nowhere.

      Applied to self: Keep yourself busy with things that don't matter
      so you never step back and ask "why am I doing this?"

  oscillating_failure:
    level: 2.5
    name: "Almost-But-Never / Oscillating Failure"
    description: "Get close to success, then pull back or sabotage."
    pattern: |
      Action → Progress → Close to success → Sabotage/Retreat →
      Reset to earlier state → Progress again → Repeat
    examples:
      - "Almost finish degree, drop out, re-enroll, almost finish, drop out"
      - "Almost close the deal, introduce concern, lose deal, find new lead, repeat"
      - "Almost have breakthrough, get distracted, start over"
    characteristics:
      - Tantalizing proximity to success
      - Never crossing the finish line
      - Repeat pattern across domains
      - '"I almost had it" as perpetual state'
    key_insight: |
      The approach creates hope. The retreat creates the drama.
      This is actually a sustainable energy source for some people.
      Success would end the cycle.

# ============================================
# FAILURE JOURNEY CHAINS
# ============================================

failure_chains:
  description: |
    Failure journeys have goal chains just like success journeys.
    The intrinsic goal is different, but the structure is the same.

  example_sustainable_failure:
    action: "Working on project but never finishing"
    chain:
      - level: action
        description: "Make progress on project, then introduce obstacles"
        serves: "Maintain state of 'working on it'"
      - level: low_instrumental
        description: "Maintain state of 'working on it'"
        serves: "Always have something to struggle with"
      - level: mid_instrumental
        description: "Always have something to struggle with"
        serves: "Have identity as someone who struggles/tries"
      - level: high_instrumental
        description: "Have identity as someone who struggles"
        serves: "Continuity of self-concept"
      - level: intrinsic
        description: "Identity / Continuity of self"
        serves: null
    type: sustainable_failure
    note: "This chain is VALID. The intrinsic goal (identity) is legitimate."

  example_strategic_suboptimization:
    action: "Keeping competitor alive but weakened"
    chain:
      - level: action
        description: "Compete enough to wound, not enough to kill"
        serves: "Maintain competitor in weakened state"
      - level: low_instrumental
        description: "Maintain competitor in weakened state"
        serves: "Prevent competitor from resetting and rethinking"
      - level: mid_instrumental
        description: "Prevent reset and rethinking"
        serves: "Keep competitor on predictable, losing path"
      - level: high_instrumental
        description: "Competitor on losing path"
        serves: "Maintain own advantage without triggering adaptation"
      - level: intrinsic
        description: "Security / Control"
        serves: null
    type: strategic_suboptimization
    note: "Complete destruction would allow competitor to start fresh."

  example_self_suboptimization:
    action: "Keeping self busy with unimportant work"
    chain:
      - level: action
        description: "Fill time with tasks that feel productive but don't advance goals"
        serves: "Maintain feeling of productivity"
      - level: low_instrumental
        description: "Feel productive"
        serves: "Avoid confronting whether current path is right"
      - level: mid_instrumental
        description: "Avoid confronting path"
        serves: "Never do backward thinking that might require change"
      - level: high_instrumental
        description: "Avoid change"
        serves: "Security in the familiar"
      - level: intrinsic
        description: "Security / Avoiding uncertainty"
        serves: null
    type: strategic_suboptimization (self-applied)
    note: |
      This is self-sabotage via busyness.
      The person is "working hard" but specifically avoiding
      the work that would force a reckoning.

# ============================================
# STORIES THAT MAP FAILURE
# ============================================

failure_in_stories:
  description: |
    Many classic stories are FAILURE JOURNEYS.
    These map the terrain of failure with the same detail
    as success stories map success.

  tragedy:
    description: "The classic failure journey"
    examples:
      - "Hamlet - oscillating failure, paralysis of analysis"
      - "Macbeth - terminal failure via overreach"
      - "Death of a Salesman - sustainable failure, identity-based"
      - "Oedipus - failure through trying to avoid failure"
    pattern: |
      Character with potential → Flaw/Choice → Path to destruction →
      Moments where could turn back → Doesn't → Catastrophe
    insight: "Tragedies often show terminal failure (Level 1)"

  noir:
    description: "The trapped failure journey"
    examples:
      - "Double Indemnity - can't escape once started"
      - "Chinatown - system is stronger than individual"
      - "No Country for Old Men - randomness defeats agency"
    pattern: |
      Character enters situation → Gets deeper → Each attempt to escape
      makes it worse → Trapped → No exit or bad exit
    insight: "Noir often shows sustainable failure - the trap that perpetuates"

  addiction_narrative:
    description: "The cycle failure journey"
    examples:
      - "Requiem for a Dream - oscillating descent"
      - "Leaving Las Vegas - terminal failure chosen"
      - "A Star Is Born - success and failure intertwined"
    pattern: |
      Character → Temporary relief via substance/behavior →
      Consequences → Need more relief → Cycle
    insight: "Addiction narratives map sustainable failure perfectly"

  anti_hero:
    description: "Success that is also failure"
    examples:
      - "Breaking Bad - succeeds at wrong goal"
      - "The Godfather - achieves power, loses self"
      - "Wolf of Wall Street - succeeds by measures, fails by values"
    pattern: |
      Character pursues goal → Achieves it → Achievement IS failure
      (by deeper values) → Realization too late (or not at all)
    insight: "Success and failure can be the same journey, different termini"

  almost_stories:
    description: "The perpetual almost"
    examples:
      - "Groundhog Day (before breakthrough) - oscillating failure"
      - "Many sports movies show this before the win"
      - "Romantic comedies use this as tension device"
    pattern: |
      Character close to goal → Something prevents → Try again →
      Close again → Prevented again → Repeat
    insight: "The 'almost' pattern is sustainable failure as entertainment"

# ============================================
# DETECTING FAILURE JOURNEYS
# ============================================

detection:
  in_self:
    questions:
      - "Am I making progress, or am I just busy?"
      - "Do I keep getting close but never finishing?"
      - "What would happen if I actually succeeded?"
      - "Am I avoiding the work that would force me to rethink?"
      - "Is my struggle part of my identity?"
    warning_signs:
      - Same pattern across different domains
      - Comfort in the struggle
      - Anxiety when close to success
      - Creating obstacles when things go well
      - '"Almost had it" as recurring theme'

  in_others:
    questions:
      - "Is this person trying to help me succeed or keep me struggling?"
      - "Would my success threaten their position?"
      - "Are they keeping me 'good enough' but never great?"
      - "Do they solve symptoms but not causes?"
    warning_signs:
      - Help that creates dependency
      - Advice that keeps you on current path
      - Competition that wounds but doesn't kill
      - Support that maintains status quo

  in_situations:
    questions:
      - "Is this system designed to produce outcomes or sustain itself?"
      - "Who benefits from this continuing without resolution?"
      - "What would happen if this actually got solved?"
    warning_signs:
      - Problems that persist despite "efforts"
      - Solutions that create new problems
      - Complexity that prevents clean resolution

# ============================================
# ESCAPING FAILURE JOURNEYS
# ============================================

escape:
  note: |
    This is OPTIONAL. Some people pursue failure and that's valid.
    But for those who want to escape, here are the methods.

  terminal_failure_escape:
    situation: "Already in Level 1 terminal failure"
    escape: |
      Terminal failure actually enables escape.
      It forces reset, opens new possibilities.
      The pain is short but enables fresh start.
    action: "Use the reset. Don't restart the same pattern."

  sustainable_failure_escape:
    situation: "Trapped in Level 2 sustainable failure"
    escape: |
      The trap is that it's never bad enough to force reset.
      Options:
      1. Deliberately trigger terminal failure (controlled demolition)
      2. Step back and do backward thinking (why am I doing this?)
      3. Change the intrinsic goal (if identity is the issue)
    action: "Force the reset that the pattern prevents."

  suboptimization_escape:
    situation: "Trapped in Level 3 strategic suboptimization"
    escape: |
      The trap is you're too busy to think.
      Options:
      1. Stop. Full stop. Create space for backward thinking.
      2. Ask: "What am I avoiding by staying busy?"
      3. Deliberately underperform to create crisis
    action: "Create the crisis that forces the rethink."

  key_insight: |
    Escaping sustainable failure often requires WORSE failure.
    The controlled demolition that forces reset.
    This is counterintuitive but necessary.

    The alternative is perpetual low-grade failure.

# ============================================
# INTEGRATION WITH SUCCESS JOURNEYS
# ============================================

integration:
  principle: |
    Every success journey has a shadow failure journey.
    Every choice point is a fork between success and failure paths.

    Complete journey mapping includes BOTH:
    - How to succeed
    - How to fail
    - How success and failure patterns interact

  example: |
    Success journey: Learn skill → Practice → Improve → Master → Achievement
    Failure shadow: Learn skill → Practice → Almost good → Sabotage → Start over

    Same beginning, divergent paths.

  for_extraction:
    when: "Extracting journeys from any source"
    add: "Look for both success and failure patterns"
    questions:
      - "What's the success path in this source?"
      - "What's the failure path?"
      - "Where do they diverge?"
      - "What failure type is shown (terminal/sustainable/strategic)?"

  for_planning:
    when: "Planning a goal"
    add: "Map potential failure patterns, not just success path"
    questions:
      - "How might I sustainably fail at this?"
      - "What would strategic suboptimization look like?"
      - "Where are the oscillation points?"
      - "What would prevent me from resetting if needed?"

# ============================================
# SELF-VALIDATION
# ============================================

self_validation:
  is_this_valid: |
    This framework might seem cynical or negative.
    But it's completing the picture, not darkening it.

    Goal journeys that only map success are INCOMPLETE.
    Human behavior includes both success-seeking AND failure-seeking.
    Many stories already map failure - we're making it explicit.

  does_it_integrate: |
    Yes. Failure journeys use the same structure:
    - Action → Goal → Goal → Intrinsic Goal
    - Each step serves the next
    - Terminates at intrinsic value

    The difference is the intrinsic goal (identity, security, connection via struggle).

  does_it_help: |
    Mapping failure helps because:
    1. Can recognize patterns in self/others
    2. Can make conscious choice (vs unconscious pattern)
    3. Can design escape routes
    4. Can understand stories more deeply
    5. For some - can pursue failure consciously as valid choice

  would_it_detract: |
    No. It adds dimension.
    A map that only shows roads to success is missing half the terrain.
    This adds the roads to failure - equally real, equally traveled.
