description: |
  A methodology for decomposing abstract goals into specific, actionable components
  while preserving important information about dimensions, tradeoffs, and constraints.

  The problem with naive decomposition: "Make the world better" becomes "Make people
  happier" - this loses almost everything. What does "better" mean? Better for whom?
  In what dimension? At what cost? Who decides?

  Good decomposition preserves information, not destroys it. You should be able to
  trace from any action back to why it serves the original goal, through explicit
  reasoning, without hidden assumptions.

core_insight: |
  Decomposition should unpack information, make it explicit, and maintain it through
  to action. If your decomposition loses nuance, hides conflicts, or enables
  rationalization - it's bad decomposition.

when_to_use:
  - When a goal is abstract or vague
  - Before committing to a plan
  - When "obvious" decomposition feels too simple
  - When you need to understand tradeoffs
  - During GOSM Goal Definition (Step 2)

# ============================================
# PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THE GOAL
# ============================================

phase_1_understand:
  name: What Does The Goal Actually Mean?
  description: Before decomposing, understand what you're decomposing.

  step_1_1_dimensions:
    name: Identify All Dimensions
    question: What aspects does this goal touch?
    process: |
      For any significant goal, consider all relevant dimensions:
      - Material wellbeing (resources, health, security)
      - Psychological wellbeing (happiness, meaning, satisfaction)
      - Social wellbeing (relationships, community, belonging)
      - Freedom (autonomy, options, self-determination)
      - Justice (fairness, equality, rights)
      - Knowledge (understanding, truth, wisdom)
      - Beauty (aesthetics, art, nature)
      - Virtue (character, ethics, integrity)
      - Sustainability (long-term, future generations)

      Don't collapse prematurely. The abstract term contains multiple dimensions.
    output: List of dimensions this goal touches

  step_1_2_perspective:
    name: Identify Whose Perspective
    question: Better/successful for whom?
    options:
      - Yourself
      - People you know
      - Your community
      - Your nation
      - Humanity
      - Future generations
      - Non-human animals
      - Life in general
      - Abstract values
    note: These can conflict. Being explicit about scope matters.
    output: Explicit scope of beneficiaries

  step_1_3_timeframe:
    name: Identify Timeframe
    question: When does success need to manifest?
    options:
      - Immediately
      - Short-term (months)
      - Medium-term (years)
      - Long-term (decades)
      - Indefinite future
    note: Short-term and long-term often conflict.
    output: Explicit timeframe with reasoning

  step_1_4_constraints:
    name: Identify Constraints
    question: What limits the goal?
    categories:
      physical: Laws of nature, resource limits
      ethical: What you won't do even for the goal
      practical: Your capabilities, position, resources
      knowledge: What's known about how to achieve it
      social: What others will accept or resist
    output: List of constraints by category

  step_1_5_expanded_definition:
    name: Write The Expanded Definition
    process: |
      Take the abstract goal and write out what it actually means given:
      - All dimensions identified
      - Explicit perspective/scope
      - Explicit timeframe
      - All constraints
    example:
      original: "Make the world a better place"
      expanded: |
        Improve material, psychological, and social wellbeing for as many people
        as possible, with particular attention to those worst off, while respecting
        human freedom and justice, in ways that are sustainable long-term, without
        causing harm to achieve short-term gains, within my actual capabilities
        and resources.
    output: Expanded goal definition

# ============================================
# PHASE 2: IDENTIFY SUBGOALS
# ============================================

phase_2_subgoals:
  name: Identify Subgoals
  description: Now decompose - but carefully.

  step_2_1_derive_from_dimensions:
    name: Derive Subgoals From Dimensions
    process: For each dimension identified, ask what it would mean to advance it.
    example:
      material_wellbeing:
        - Reduce poverty
        - Improve health outcomes
        - Increase security
        - Provide basic needs
      psychological_wellbeing:
        - Reduce suffering
        - Increase meaning and purpose
        - Enable satisfaction with life
        - Support mental health
      freedom:
        - Expand options
        - Protect autonomy
        - Remove coercion
        - Enable self-determination
    output: Subgoals for each dimension

  step_2_2_dependencies:
    name: Identify Subgoal Dependencies
    question: Which subgoals enable or block others?
    examples:
      - Material wellbeing enables psychological wellbeing (hard to be happy while starving)
      - Freedom enables material wellbeing (autonomy allows pursuit of resources)
      - Justice enables sustainability (unfair systems get overthrown)
      - Knowledge enables everything (can't improve what you don't understand)
    output: Dependency graph of subgoals

  step_2_3_conflicts:
    name: Identify Subgoal Conflicts
    question: Which subgoals trade off against each other?
    common_conflicts:
      - Short-term happiness vs long-term wellbeing
      - Individual freedom vs collective outcomes
      - Local benefit vs global fairness
      - Current generations vs future generations
      - Efficiency vs resilience
    note: Be explicit about these. Naive decomposition hides them.
    output: List of subgoal conflicts

  step_2_4_document_relationships:
    name: Write Subgoal Relationships
    document:
      - What enables what
      - What conflicts with what
      - What is foundational
      - What is downstream
    note: This creates a graph, not a list.
    output: Subgoal relationship graph

# ============================================
# PHASE 3: PRIORITIZE SUBGOALS
# ============================================

phase_3_prioritize:
  name: Prioritize Subgoals
  description: Not all subgoals are equal. How to prioritize.

  step_3_1_criteria:
    name: Apply Prioritization Criteria
    criteria:
      ease: How hard to advance this?
      ethics: How clearly good is advancing this?
      accessibility: Can you actually work on this?
      amplification: Does this enable other subgoals?
      overlooked: Is this underserved by others?
      probability: How likely to succeed?
      impact: How much does advancing this matter?
    output: Scored subgoals

  step_3_2_weight_by_dependencies:
    name: Weight By Dependencies
    principle: Foundational subgoals (that enable others) get priority.
    examples:
      - If knowledge enables everything, advancing knowledge might be highest priority
      - If justice enables sustainability, justice might come before sustainability
    output: Dependency-weighted priorities

  step_3_3_account_for_conflicts:
    name: Account For Conflicts
    when_subgoals_conflict:
      - Which matters more? (value judgment)
      - Can the conflict be mitigated? (creative solution)
      - At what cost is each achievable? (practical reality)
      - What's the acceptable tradeoff? (explicit choice)
    note: Document these decisions. They're part of the plan.
    output: Documented tradeoff decisions

  step_3_4_comparative_advantage:
    name: Consider Comparative Advantage
    question: Where can YOU specifically contribute?
    prompts:
      - What do you know that others don't?
      - What can you do that others can't?
      - What position do you have that's unique?
      - Where is your effort unusually valuable?
    formula: Priority = importance * your_ability_to_contribute
    output: Personal priority ranking

# ============================================
# PHASE 4: SPECIFY ACTIONS
# ============================================

phase_4_actions:
  name: Specify Action-Level Goals
  description: Translate subgoals to concrete actions.

  step_4_1_for_each_subgoal:
    name: Generate Action Options
    question: What would I actually DO to advance this?
    example:
      subgoal: Reduce poverty
      actions:
        - Donate to effective charities
        - Build businesses that employ people
        - Advocate for better policies
        - Develop technologies that reduce costs
    note: These are still choices. Different approaches to the same subgoal.
    output: Action options per subgoal

  step_4_2_apply_constraints:
    name: Filter Actions By Constraints
    filter_by:
      - Can I actually do this? (capability)
      - Do I have the resources? (practical)
      - Is it ethical? (constraint)
      - Does it conflict with other actions? (coordination)
      - What's the realistic impact? (effectiveness)
    output: Filtered action list

  step_4_3_sequence:
    name: Sequence Actions
    dependencies:
      - Build capability before deploying it
      - Gather information before acting on it
      - Establish trust before collaborating
    output: Sequenced action plan

  step_4_4_success_criteria:
    name: Define Success Criteria
    for_each_action:
      - What would success look like?
      - How would you know you've succeeded?
      - What's the minimum viable outcome?
      - What's the stretch goal?
    note: Make it concrete and measurable where possible.
    output: Success criteria per action

# ============================================
# COMMON TRAPS
# ============================================

common_traps:
  stopping_at_slogans:
    description: '"Address inequality" is a slogan, not a goal.'
    fix: Keep decomposing until you have something you could measure and act on.

  hiding_value_judgments:
    description: Choosing "happiness" over "freedom" is a value judgment, not obvious truth.
    fix: Make every value judgment explicit. Write it down. Justify it.

  ignoring_conflicts:
    description: Pretending there are no tradeoffs makes them invisible, not resolved.
    fix: Actively look for conflicts. Document them. Decide how to handle them.

  confusing_levels:
    description: '"Make the world better" and "donate $100" are different levels.'
    fix: Keep levels explicit. Know which level you're operating at.

  forgetting_constraints:
    description: The perfect decomposition that's impossible to execute is worthless.
    fix: Apply constraints at every level. Filter for what's actually achievable.

  losing_the_whole:
    description: Getting so focused on subgoals that you forget the original goal.
    fix: Regularly check - do the subgoals actually add up to the original goal?

  analysis_paralysis:
    description: Decomposing forever instead of acting.
    fix: Good enough decomposition executed beats perfect decomposition never started.

key_principle: |
  Decomposition should preserve information, not destroy it.

  The abstract goal contains information about what matters. Decomposition should
  unpack that information, make it explicit, and maintain it through to action.

  Good decomposition: you can trace from any action back to why it serves the
  original goal, through explicit reasoning, without hidden assumptions.
