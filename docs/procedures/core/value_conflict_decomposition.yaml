description: |
  Goals often serve multiple intrinsic values that conflict with each other.
  This procedure helps detect these conflicts, understand their structure,
  and find navigation strategies that don't require abandoning either value.

  Key insight: Most value conflicts are not "pick one" situations.
  They are tensions to be navigated, not problems to be solved.

when_to_use:
  - Goal feels stuck between two directions
  - Strategy selection paralysis
  - Recurring oscillation between approaches
  - Sense of "damned if I do, damned if I don't"
  - Goal chain analysis revealed multiple termini

# ============================================
# CORE VALUE TENSIONS
# ============================================

core_tensions:
  description: |
    These are fundamental tensions that appear across many goal structures.
    They are not bugs - they are features of having multiple values.

  security_vs_achievement:
    name: Security vs Achievement
    description: |
      Security wants: Stability, predictability, risk avoidance, preservation
      Achievement wants: Growth, challenge, risk-taking, transformation

      The conflict: Achievement requires risking what security wants to protect.

    manifestations:
      - "I want to start a business but I need income stability"
      - "I want to learn new skills but I'm good at current ones"
      - "I want to try bold strategies but safe ones are... safe"
      - "I want to change but I don't want to lose what I have"

    false_framings:
      - "I must choose between security and achievement"
      - "Security is cowardice, achievement is courage"
      - '"I''ll achieve first, then get secure" (often fails)'
      - '"I''ll get secure first, then achieve" (often never happens)'

    actual_structure:
      - Security and achievement exist on different timescales
      - Short-term security can enable long-term achievement
      - Short-term risk can create long-term security
      - The question is sequencing and sizing, not choosing

  freedom_vs_security:
    name: Freedom vs Security
    description: |
      Freedom wants: Options, autonomy, independence, flexibility
      Security wants: Stability, predictability, structure, safety

      The conflict: Security often requires commitment that constrains freedom.
      Freedom often requires accepting risks that threaten security.

    manifestations:
      - "I want freedom to choose but also want guaranteed outcomes"
      - "I want independence but also want support structures"
      - "I want flexibility but also want reliable routines"
      - "I want to keep options open but also want to commit deeply"

    false_framings:
      - "Freedom means no constraints"
      - "Security means total predictability"
      - "I must choose between freedom and security"
      - "Freedom is irresponsible, security is mature"

    actual_structure:
      - Some freedoms enable security (freedom to exit bad situations)
      - Some security enables freedom (financial security enables risk-taking)
      - The question is which freedoms and which securities, not freedom vs security
      - Often the conflict is between different kinds of freedom or different kinds of security

  individual_vs_relational:
    name: Individual vs Relational
    description: |
      Individual wants: Personal development, autonomy, self-expression, boundaries
      Relational wants: Connection, belonging, contribution, interdependence

      The conflict: Deep relationships require compromise of individual preferences.
      Strong individuality can create distance from others.

    manifestations:
      - "I want deep relationships but I need my space"
      - "I want to help others but I need to take care of myself"
      - "I want to belong but I don't want to conform"
      - "I want connection but I don't want obligation"

    false_framings:
      - "Selfishness vs selflessness"
      - "I must sacrifice myself for relationships"
      - "I must protect myself from relationships"
      - "Independence means not needing anyone"

    actual_structure:
      - Healthy relationships require healthy individuals
      - Healthy individuals exist in relationships
      - The question is boundaries and integration, not choosing
      - Often the conflict is about specific relationships, not relationships in general

  meaning_vs_pleasure:
    name: Meaning vs Pleasure
    description: |
      Meaning wants: Purpose, contribution, significance, legacy
      Pleasure wants: Enjoyment, comfort, satisfaction, ease

      The conflict: Meaningful work is often difficult and uncomfortable.
      Pleasant activities often feel empty or insignificant.

    manifestations:
      - "I want work that matters but I also want to enjoy my life"
      - "I feel guilty when I relax instead of doing important things"
      - "I feel burned out from only doing meaningful work"
      - "Easy things feel hollow, hard things feel exhausting"

    false_framings:
      - "Meaning requires suffering"
      - "Pleasure is shallow"
      - "I must choose between a meaningful life and an enjoyable life"
      - "Rest is laziness"

    actual_structure:
      - Meaning and pleasure are complementary at different timescales
      - Sustainable meaning requires pleasure/rest
      - Deep pleasure often comes from meaningful activity
      - The question is rhythm and integration, not choosing

  process_vs_outcome:
    name: Process vs Outcome
    description: |
      Outcome wants: Results, achievement, completion, success
      Process wants: Experience, journey, growth, presence

      The conflict: Outcome focus can make the process miserable.
      Process focus can neglect the goal entirely.

    manifestations:
      - "I want to achieve X but I also want to enjoy getting there"
      - "I'm so focused on the goal I'm not present to the journey"
      - "I'm so focused on the journey I never reach the goal"
      - "Success feels empty, but failure during enjoyable process still feels like failure"

    false_framings:
      - "The outcome is all that matters"
      - "The journey is all that matters"
      - "You can't have both"

    actual_structure:
      - Good processes tend to produce good outcomes
      - Good outcomes achieved through bad processes often don't last
      - The question is integration, not choosing
      - Process and outcome inform each other

  known_vs_unknown:
    name: Known vs Unknown
    description: |
      Known wants: Expertise, mastery, competence, reliability
      Unknown wants: Exploration, discovery, novelty, learning

      The conflict: Mastery requires depth in known areas.
      Discovery requires venturing into unknown areas.

    manifestations:
      - "I want to be excellent at something but I also want to try new things"
      - "I'm bored with what I know but scared of what I don't"
      - "I want to specialize but I also want to be versatile"
      - "Deep expertise vs broad capability"

    false_framings:
      - "Jack of all trades, master of none"
      - "Specialists are better than generalists"
      - "You must choose between depth and breadth"

    actual_structure:
      - T-shaped: depth in one area, breadth across many
      - Serial mastery: deep in one, then another
      - Exploration phases and exploitation phases
      - The question is sequencing and allocation, not choosing

# CONFLICT DETECTION
# ============================================

detection:
  description: How to identify when a value conflict is present

  symptoms:
    - Oscillation between two approaches
    - Feeling stuck despite clear options
    - '"Yes, but..." responses to every strategy'
    - Recurring dissatisfaction with any choice
    - Goal feels impossible despite being feasible
    - Strategies that address one thing make another worse
    - Feeling of internal division or parts
    - Repeated revisiting of "resolved" decisions

  questions:
    - "When I imagine achieving this goal, what feels threatened?"
    - "When I imagine NOT pursuing this goal, what feels threatened?"
    - "What would I have to give up to fully commit to this approach?"
    - "What two things do I want that seem incompatible?"
    - "What part of me wants this? What part of me resists?"
    - "If I could only have one thing, what would I lose by giving up the other?"

  conflict_identification:
    step_1: "List all intrinsic values this goal serves (from goal chain analysis)"
    step_2: "For each pair of values, ask: Does pursuing one threaten the other?"
    step_3: "For each tension found, name it using the core tensions above or create new name"
    step_4: "Rate the tension: Mild (noticeable) / Moderate (blocking) / Severe (paralyzing)"

# CONFLICT ANALYSIS
# ============================================

analysis:
  description: Deep understanding of a specific conflict

  decomposition_questions:
    nature:
      - "What specifically does Value A want in this situation?"
      - "What specifically does Value B want in this situation?"
      - "What is the specific incompatibility? (Not abstract, concrete)"
      - "Is this a resource conflict (can't allocate to both) or a direction conflict (can't go both ways)?"

    temporality:
      - "Does this conflict exist at all timescales, or only some?"
      - "Is Value A more short-term and Value B more long-term, or vice versa?"
      - "Could sequencing resolve the conflict? (A first, then B? B first, then A?)"
      - "Is this conflict permanent or situational?"

    dimensionality:
      - "Is this really one conflict or multiple conflicts bundled?"
      - "Can I get 80% of Value A without threatening Value B?"
      - "Can I get 80% of Value B without threatening Value A?"
      - "What is the minimum of each that I actually need?"

    history:
      - "When has this conflict appeared before in my life?"
      - "What did I do then? What happened?"
      - "Have I ever successfully navigated this conflict? How?"
      - "What would someone who's good at this conflict do?"

    false_dichotomy_check:
      - "Is this really either/or, or does it only appear that way?"
      - "What would BOTH look like? Even partially?"
      - "Who has achieved both? What did they do differently?"
      - "What assumption makes this feel like a forced choice?"

  output_format:
    conflict_name: "[Name from core tensions or custom]"
    value_a: "[Specific value and what it wants]"
    value_b: "[Specific value and what it wants]"
    specific_incompatibility: "[Concrete description of the conflict]"
    conflict_type: "[Resource / Direction / Timing / Both]"

# ============================================
# NAVIGATION STRATEGIES
# ============================================

navigation:
  description: |
    Strategies for navigating value conflicts without abandoning either value.
    Navigation is not resolution - the conflict may persist, but you can move through it.

  strategies:

    temporal_sequencing:
      name: Temporal Sequencing
      description: Address values at different times
      when_to_use: "When values don't conflict at all timescales"
      approach:
        - "Identify which value is more urgent vs which is more important"
        - "Create explicit phases for each value"
        - "Define transition criteria between phases"
        - "Ensure later phase actually happens (schedule, commitment)"
      example: |
        Security vs Achievement: Build 6 months runway (security), then take risks (achievement)
        Freedom vs Security: Explore options (freedom), then commit with exit criteria (security)
      risks:
        - "Later phase never happens"
        - "Earlier phase expands indefinitely"
        - "Transition criteria never met"

    partial_satisfaction:
      name: Partial Satisfaction
      description: Get enough of both, not maximum of either
      when_to_use: "When 80% of each is acceptable and achievable"
      approach:
        - "Define minimum acceptable level for each value"
        - "Find strategies that meet both minimums"
        - "Accept that maximum of either is not the goal"
        - "Optimize for the combination, not the individual values"
      example: |
        Individual vs Relational: 3 nights/week social, 4 nights/week alone
        Process vs Outcome: Enjoy the work AND hit the deadline
      risks:
        - "Neither value feels fully honored"
        - "Resentment at not getting maximum"
        - "Creeping expansion of one at expense of other"

    domain_separation:
      name: Domain Separation
      description: Honor different values in different life areas
      when_to_use: "When conflict is not about the same resource or domain"
      approach:
        - "Identify domains where Value A can dominate"
        - "Identify domains where Value B can dominate"
        - "Create clear boundaries between domains"
        - "Resist bleeding between domains"
      example: |
        Security vs Achievement: Secure salary job + risky side project
        Known vs Unknown: Expert in work domain + beginner in hobbies
      risks:
        - "Domains bleed into each other"
        - "One domain expands to consume others"
        - "Integration problems between domains"

    reframing:
      name: Reframing
      description: Dissolve false dichotomy by seeing the conflict differently
      when_to_use: "When the conflict is based on a false assumption"
      approach:
        - "Question the assumption that creates the conflict"
        - "Look for third options that weren't visible"
        - "Examine if the values are actually opposed or just appear so"
        - "Consider what both values ultimately want"
      example: |
        "I need stability (security) OR I need to take risks (achievement)"
        Reframe: "What if small risks create stability? What if stability enables larger risks?"

        "I need to be independent (individual) OR connected (relational)"
        Reframe: "What if healthy relationships require independence? What if independence exists within connection?"
      risks:
        - "Reframing that papers over real conflict"
        - "Intellectualizing without actual resolution"
        - "Avoiding the real tension"

    integration:
      name: Integration
      description: Find approaches that honor both values simultaneously
      when_to_use: "When the values are complementary at a deeper level"
      approach:
        - "Look for what both values are ultimately trying to achieve"
        - "Find strategies that serve the deeper goal"
        - "Design for the combination, not the compromise"
        - "Test if the integration actually satisfies both"
      example: |
        Meaning vs Pleasure: Find work that is both meaningful AND enjoyable
        Process vs Outcome: Design processes that are enjoyable AND effective
      risks:
        - "Integration that doesn't actually satisfy either"
        - "Rare strategies that only work in ideal conditions"
        - "Ignoring real tradeoffs that integration can't solve"

    dynamic_balancing:
      name: Dynamic Balancing
      description: Consciously oscillate between values based on feedback
      when_to_use: "When the right balance changes over time"
      approach:
        - "Define indicators that signal need for Value A"
        - "Define indicators that signal need for Value B"
        - "Create explicit check-in points to assess balance"
        - "Have ready strategies for shifting in either direction"
      example: |
        Freedom vs Security: Check quarterly - if feeling trapped, increase freedom; if feeling unstable, increase security
        Individual vs Relational: If lonely, increase connection; if depleted, increase solitude
      risks:
        - "Oscillation without progress"
        - "Indicators that are lagging or misleading"
        - "Reactive instead of proactive"

    acceptance:
      name: Acceptance
      description: Accept that some tension is permanent and live with it consciously
      when_to_use: "When the conflict is real and unsolvable"
      approach:
        - "Acknowledge that the tension is real"
        - "Stop trying to solve what can't be solved"
        - "Develop capacity to hold both values simultaneously"
        - "Find meaning in the navigation itself"
      example: |
        "I will always want both security and achievement. The tension itself is part of being human.
        I don't need to resolve it. I need to navigate it wisely."
      risks:
        - "Premature acceptance when resolution is possible"
        - "Learned helplessness"
        - "Using acceptance to avoid action"

# ============================================
# PROCEDURE STEPS
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Detect Conflict
    action: |
      Use the detection questions and symptoms to identify if a value conflict is present.
      If goal chain analysis has been done, review the intrinsic termini for conflicts.
    output: "Conflict present? (yes/no/maybe). If yes, initial naming."

  - id: 2
    name: Name the Conflict
    action: |
      Match the conflict to core tensions above, or create a custom name.
      Use format: "[Value A] vs [Value B]"
      Be specific about what each value wants in THIS situation.
    output: "Named conflict with specific descriptions"

  - id: 3
    name: Analyze the Conflict
    action: |
      Use the decomposition questions to understand:

      - Whether it's really one conflict or several
      - Historical patterns
      - False dichotomy check
    output: "Completed conflict analysis in output_format"

  - id: 4
    name: Select Navigation Strategy
    action: |
      Review the navigation strategies above.
      For each, ask: Does this apply to this conflict?
      Often multiple strategies combine.
    output: "Selected strategy or combination with rationale"

  - id: 5
    name: Design Specific Approach
    action: |
      Given the selected strategy, design concrete approach:
      - What specifically will you do?
      - How will you know if it's working?
      - What are the risks and mitigations?
      - What would cause you to try a different strategy?
    output: "Concrete approach with success criteria and pivot triggers"

  - id: 6
    name: Integrate into Goal Plan
    action: |
      The conflict navigation becomes part of the goal plan.
      Add check-in points to assess if navigation is working.
      Document the conflict and approach for future reference.
    output: "Updated goal plan with conflict navigation integrated"

# ============================================
# VERIFICATION

verification:
  - "Both values are named and described specifically"
  - "The specific incompatibility is articulated (not vague)"
  - "False dichotomy check was performed"
  - "Navigation strategy selected with rationale"
  - "Concrete approach designed, not just abstract strategy"
  - "Success criteria and pivot triggers defined"
  - "Plan includes check-in points for the navigation"

failure_modes:

    symptom: "Approach only serves one value"
    resolution: "Revisit the conflict - both values are real"

  - mode: "False resolution"
    symptom: "Claims conflict is solved but tension persists"
    resolution: "Acceptance may be more honest than false resolution"

  - mode: "Over-analysis without action"
    symptom: "Perfect understanding of conflict, no navigation"
    resolution: "Pick a strategy and try it. Adjust based on results."

  - mode: "Premature acceptance"
    symptom: "Accepting conflict as unsolvable before trying strategies"
    resolution: "Try temporal sequencing, partial satisfaction, reframing first"
