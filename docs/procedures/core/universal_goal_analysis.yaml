description: |
  The comprehensive question framework that applies to EVERY goal, regardless of domain.

  v6.0 improvements:
  - Added mathematical analysis categories: probability, rates/accumulation, structure/mapping,
    continuity/connectedness, sets/logic, graphs/networks, dimensionality, symmetry, order, combinatorics
  - Added applied analysis categories: inventory management, invoicing, customer relations,
    problem solving, communication, coaching, leadership, negotiation, management, writing,
    quality assurance, detail analysis
  - All previous v5.0 content preserved
  - All questions follow "is there" before "what is" pattern
  - No assumptions about things existing before asking if they exist
  - Recursive structures for tracing requirements

when_to_use:
  - Any new goal
  - Any goal that feels stuck
  - Any goal where approach is uncertain
  - Periodic review of ongoing goals

  EVERY GOAL FAILS FOR ANSWERABLE REASONS.

  Either the goal was wrong, the strategy was wrong, the execution was wrong,
  or something external changed. All of these can be anticipated by asking
  the right questions upfront.

  This framework doesn't guarantee success. It guarantees you've thought
  about everything that matters before you start.

  v6.0: Added mathematical analysis categories (probability, rates, structures,
  topology, sets, graphs, dimensions, symmetry, order, combinatorics) and
  applied analysis categories (inventory, invoicing, customer relations,
  problem solving, communication, coaching, leadership, negotiation,
  management, writing, quality assurance, detail analysis). All questions
  follow the "is there" before "what is" pattern to avoid assumptions.
