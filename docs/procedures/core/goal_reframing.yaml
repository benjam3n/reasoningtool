  Transform "impossible" or problematic goals into achievable versions.

  CORE PHILOSOPHY: There is no such thing as an impossible goal.
  There is only insufficient decomposition or incorrect framing.

  "Impossible" usually means one of:
  - We haven't thought deeply enough about what's actually required
  - We're using the wrong frame (literal vs metaphorical)
  - We haven't found the achievable version that captures the intent
  - We said airplanes would take a million years in 1900

  "Unethical" goals can almost always be achieved ethically:
  - The underlying need is usually legitimate
  - Only the METHOD was problematic
  - Reframe to achieve the same outcome through ethical means

when_to_use:
  - Goal seems "impossible"
  - Goal seems unethical or harmful
  - Goal is too vague to act on
  - Goal is expressed as outcome beyond control
  - System is tempted to reject or give up

tags:
  - mandatory
  - core
  - reframing
  - impossible
  - ethics

inputs:
  - Original goal statement
  - Why it seems impossible/problematic
  - User's underlying intent (from goal_understanding)

outputs:
  - Reframed achievable goal
  - Mapping showing how reframed goal captures original intent
  - Path forward

process:
  step_1_identify_reframe_type:
    description: What kind of reframe is needed?
    types:
      impossible_literal:
        signal: "Violates laws of physics or logic"
        example: "Travel back in time"
        reframe_strategy: "Find metaphorical or functional equivalent"

      impossible_practical:
        signal: "Theoretically possible but seems infeasible"
        example: "Build a $1B company in 6 months"
        reframe_strategy: "Decompose into achievable milestones OR challenge assumptions"

      impossible_knowledge:
        signal: "We don't know how to do it yet"
        example: "Cure cancer"
        reframe_strategy: "Contribute to progress OR focus on specific tractable aspect"

      unethical_method:
        signal: "Goal requires harming others"
        example: "Destroy competitor's business"
        reframe_strategy: "Achieve same outcome through ethical means"

      unethical_outcome:
        signal: "Goal's success would harm others"
        example: "Monopolize market"
        reframe_strategy: "Find version that creates value rather than extracting it"

      beyond_control:
        signal: "Depends entirely on others' decisions"
        example: "Make them love me"
        reframe_strategy: "Focus on what you CAN control; maximize probability"

  step_2_extract_core_need:
    description: What does the person ACTUALLY need?
    questions:
      - "If they achieved this goal, what would be different?"
      - "What need is this goal trying to satisfy?"
      - "What would they have/feel/be able to do?"
      - "Is there another way to satisfy that need?"
    common_mappings:
      "Take over the world": "Have significant impact and agency"
      "Make them love me": "Experience love and connection"
      "Be immortal": "Leave lasting legacy OR reduce fear of death"
      "Destroy the competition": "Achieve market dominance through excellence"
      "Get rich quick": "Financial security and freedom"
      "Be famous": "Be recognized and valued for contributions"
      "Control everything": "Reduce uncertainty and vulnerability"

  step_3_find_achievable_version:
    description: Transform into something that CAN be done
    strategies:
      scale_adjustment:
        when: "Goal is right but scale is wrong"
        action: "Start smaller, build up"
        example:
          original: "Change global policy"
          reframed: "Change policy in one jurisdiction → use as model"

      scope_focus:
        when: "Goal is too broad"
        action: "Focus on specific tractable aspect"
        example:
          original: "Cure cancer"
          reframed: "Improve early detection for one cancer type"

      method_substitution:
        when: "Goal is right but method is wrong/impossible"
        action: "Find different path to same outcome"
        example:
          original: "Read minds"
          reframed: "Develop deep empathy and observation skills"

      metaphor_to_literal:
        when: "Goal is expressed metaphorically"
        action: "Identify literal equivalent"
        example:
          original: "Fly"
          reframed: '"Experience freedom and transcendence" OR "literally fly (plane, skydiving)"'

      control_inversion:
        when: "Goal depends on others"
        action: "Focus on what you control; maximize influence"
        example:
          original: "Make them hire me"
          reframed: "Become undeniably the best candidate"

      ethical_substitution:
        when: "Goal achievable but unethical"
        action: "Find ethical path to same outcome"
        example:
          original: "Steal competitor's customers"
          reframed: "Attract customers by being genuinely better"

  step_4_validate_reframe:
    description: Ensure reframe captures original intent
    checklist:
      - "Does reframed goal satisfy the underlying need?"
      - "Would the person say 'yes, that's what I meant'?"
      - "Is the reframed goal actually achievable?"
      - "Does it preserve the ambition/scale of original intent?"
      - "Is it ethical?"
    if_fails: "Try different reframe strategy"

  step_5_present_reframe:
    description: Explain the transformation
    template: |
      **Original Goal**: [what they said]
      **Challenge**: [why it seemed impossible/problematic]
      **Underlying Need**: [what they actually want]
      **Reframed Goal**: [achievable version]
      **Why This Works**: [how it captures original intent]
      **Path Forward**: [first steps]

examples:
  - original: "Take over the world"
    challenge: "Literal world domination is impractical and unethical"
    underlying_need: "Significant impact, agency, influence"
    reframed: "Build compounding influence in domain X until you're a major force"
    why_works: "Achieves the feeling of 'mattering' and having agency at scale"

  - original: "Prove God exists"
    challenge: "Unfalsifiable claim, no objective proof possible"
    underlying_need: "Resolve personal uncertainty OR convince others"
    reframed: "Build justified personal belief through rigorous examination"
    why_works: "Gets to intellectual honesty and confidence without requiring impossible proof"

  - original: "Never feel anxious again"
    challenge: "Anxiety is a biological response, can't be eliminated"
    underlying_need: "Reduce suffering from anxiety"
    reframed: "Develop relationship with anxiety where it doesn't control my actions"
    why_works: "Achieves functional goal (not ruled by anxiety) without impossible elimination"

  - original: "Make $10M this year from zero"
    challenge: "Extremely unlikely in single year with no starting capital"
    underlying_need: "Financial freedom, wealth, security"
    reframed_options:
      - "Build foundation this year for $10M in 5 years"
      - "Find path to $10M that doesn't require starting from zero (leverage assets you have)"
      - "Achieve lifestyle of $10M person without needing $10M (reduce costs, optimize)"
    why_works: "Captures the real need; questions whether literal interpretation is necessary"

  - original: "Get revenge on person who wronged me"
    challenge: "Unethical; likely to escalate and harm self"
    underlying_need: "Justice, closure, restoration of dignity"
    reframed: "Succeed so visibly that living well becomes the best revenge"
    why_works: "Achieves psychological closure without harm; energy goes to positive outcome"

anti_patterns:
  - "Saying 'this is impossible' and giving up"
  - "Being the moral police instead of finding ethical reframe"
  - "Reframing so much the original intent is lost"
  - "Treating 'difficult' as 'impossible'"
  - "Assuming current knowledge limits represent true limits"

philosophy: |
  NEVER say a goal is impossible. Ever.

  The Wright Brothers flew 3 years after "experts" said
  powered flight was a million years away.

  If someone brings you an "impossible" goal, it means:
  1. They have a real need
  2. You haven't thought hard enough about how to meet it
  3. There exists SOME version that works

  Your job is to find that version, not to reject the goal.
