description: |
  Addresses the n+1 critic problem: any critic can be criticized, infinitely.

  Instead of seeking one termination criterion, apply multiple INDEPENDENT criteria.
  Accept when they converge. Investigate when they diverge. This doesn't eliminate
  uncertainty but makes it explicit and manageable.

core_insight: |
  The n+1 problem may be genuinely unresolvable in principle. The question isn't
  "how to achieve certainty" but "how to operate under irreducible uncertainty."

  The answer: converge from multiple independent methods. When they agree, that's
  stronger evidence than any single method. When they disagree, that reveals
  where genuine uncertainty lies.

# ============================================
# THE FOUR INDEPENDENT CHECKS
# ============================================

termination_criteria:

  1_grounding_check:
    name: "Grounding Check"
    question: "Can this be traced to verifiable foundations?"
    method: |
      1. Identify the key claims/conclusions
      2. For each claim, ask: what is this based on?
      3. Trace backward to foundations
      4. Classify foundation level (using epistemic_hierarchy):
         - Level 0: Undeniable (experience exists)
         - Level 1: Pragmatic necessity (invariant across metaphysical views)
         - Level 1.5: Ethical constraints (hard to reject coherently)
         - Level 2: Empirical regularities (testable)
         - Level 3: Situation-specific derivation
    pass_condition: |
      All claims trace to Level 0-2 foundations without gaps.
      If gaps exist, they are flagged as assumptions.
    independence: |
      Grounding is about tracing to foundations.
      This is independent of whether the claim is useful (practical check),
      survives self-application (fixed-point), or others agree (convergence).

  2_fixed_point_check:
    name: "Fixed-Point Check"
    question: "Does this survive self-application?"
    method: |
      1. Apply the claim/method to itself
      2. Does the output contradict the input?
      3. Does it return something equivalent?
    examples:
      - claim: "All claims should be questioned"
        self_application: "Should this claim be questioned?"
        result: "Yes, and questioning it doesn't undermine it - it's consistent"
      - claim: "Only believe things with evidence"
        self_application: "What evidence supports this claim?"
        result: "Pragmatic evidence - acting on it produces better outcomes"
    pass_condition: |
      Claim survives self-application without contradiction.
      Note: fixed-point doesn't mean correct, just self-consistent.
    independence: |
      Self-consistency is independent of grounding (circular arguments are
      self-consistent but poorly grounded), practical outcomes, and others' agreement.

  3_convergence_check:
    name: "Convergence Check"
    question: "Do independent derivations agree?"
    method: |
      1. Identify claim/conclusion
      2. Find independent sources/derivations of similar claims
         - Different authors, different eras, different domains
         - Different methodologies reaching same conclusion
      3. Assess degree of convergence
    convergence_levels:
      strong: "Multiple independent derivations, same conclusion"
      moderate: "Some independent support, some disagreement"
      weak: "Only one derivation, or derivations are not independent"
      divergent: "Independent derivations reach contradictory conclusions"
    pass_condition: |
      Strong or moderate convergence. Weak is flagged. Divergent fails.
    independence: |
      Convergence is about agreement across sources.
      Independent of grounding (many people can be wrong together),
      self-consistency (convergent claims can be inconsistent),
      and practical outcomes (convergent beliefs can be impractical).

  4_practical_check:
    name: "Practical Check"
    question: "Does this produce better outcomes than alternatives?"
    method: |
      1. Identify what "better outcomes" means for this domain
      2. Compare outcomes when applying claim vs not applying
      3. Assess evidence quality for this comparison
    evidence_types:
      empirical: "Tested and measured outcomes"
      theoretical: "Predicted but not yet tested"
      absent: "No evidence either way"
    pass_condition: |
      Empirical or strong theoretical evidence of better outcomes.
      Absent evidence is flagged, not automatic fail.
    independence: |
      Practical outcomes are independent of philosophical grounding,
      self-consistency, and what others believe. A well-grounded,
      self-consistent, convergent belief can still fail practically.

# ============================================
# THE DECISION PROTOCOL
# ============================================

decision_protocol:

  all_pass:
    condition: "All four checks pass"
    action: "Accept with high confidence"
    rationale: |
      Grounded + self-consistent + convergent + practical is strong.
      No single method is perfect, but agreement across four
      independent methods is robust evidence.

  three_pass:
    condition: "Three of four checks pass"
    action: "Accept with moderate confidence, investigate the failure"
    questions:
      - "Which check failed and why?"
      - "Is the failure revealing a genuine problem or a limitation of that check?"
      - "Can the output be modified to pass all four?"

  two_pass:
    condition: "Two of four checks pass"
    action: "Flag significant uncertainty, investigate before accepting"
    questions:
      - "Which two failed?"
      - "Are the failures related or independent?"
      - "What would it take to resolve the failures?"

  one_or_zero_pass:
    condition: "One or zero checks pass"
    action: "Do not accept. Investigate fundamental issues."
    questions:
      - "Why does this fail multiple independent checks?"
      - "Is the output fundamentally flawed?"
      - "Should the approach be reconsidered?"

  disagreement_investigation:
    principle: |
      When checks disagree, the disagreement itself is information.
      Don't force resolution - understand what the disagreement reveals.
    process:
      - Identify which checks agree vs disagree
      - Characterize the nature of disagreement
      - Ask: what assumption would need to be true for each check?
      - The conflicting assumptions reveal where uncertainty lies
      - Document the uncertainty explicitly rather than hiding it

# ============================================
# HANDLING THE n+1 PROBLEM
# ============================================

n_plus_1_handling:

  the_problem: |
    Any critic can be criticized. The critic of the critic can be criticized.
    This regress appears infinite.

  why_this_helps: |
    Multiple independent termination criteria create convergent evidence.
    If grounding says "accept," fixed-point says "accept," convergence says
    "accept," and practical says "accept" - that's four independent reasons.

    A critic attacking the output must now attack all four, or explain why
    their agreement is coincidental.

  remaining_uncertainty: |
    This doesn't eliminate the n+1 problem. The four checks themselves can
    be criticized. But:
    1. Criticizing all four independently is harder than criticizing one
    2. The checks are chosen to be independent - attacking one doesn't
       automatically attack others
    3. If a criticism survives all four counter-checks, it's likely legitimate

  loop_detection: |
    If critique-of-critique-of-critique loops without adding new information,
    the loop itself is evidence of exhaustion. No new criticism is available.

    Signs of loop:
    - Same objection reworded
    - Meta-objection without object-level content
    - "But how do you know THAT?" without specific concern

    When loop detected: flag as exhausted, accept tentatively.

  symmetric_critic_integration: |
    From unassailable_output: the critic must also be unassailable.
    This filters weak criticisms before they enter the n+1 chain.

    A criticism is weak if:
    - It uses worse logic than what it criticizes
    - It could itself be attacked with a stronger argument
    - It's pedantic without substantive concern
    - It's vague where the output is specific

    Only legitimate criticisms proceed to the convergent validation.

# ============================================
# INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROCEDURES
# ============================================

integration:

  with_unassailable_output:
    relationship: |
      Unassailable output sets the standard.
      Convergent validation provides the termination criteria.
      Use unassailable's symmetric critic to filter, then
      convergent validation to decide acceptance.

  with_assumption_elimination:
    relationship: |
      The grounding check IS assumption elimination applied.
      If assumptions remain ungrounded, grounding check fails.

  with_epistemic_hierarchy:
    relationship: |
      Grounding check uses epistemic hierarchy levels.
      Level 0-2 foundations are acceptable grounds.
      Level 3 (situation-specific) requires Level 0-2 support.

  with_recursive_causal_interrogation:
    relationship: |
      RCI can be used to trace claims backward to grounding.
      Convergent validation evaluates whether that tracing succeeded.

# ============================================
# PRACTICAL APPLICATION
# ============================================

practical_application:

  when_to_use:
    - Before finalizing important decisions
    - When facing persistent disagreement
    - When n+1 regress threatens to continue indefinitely
    - When need explicit confidence assessment

  quick_version:
    steps:
      - "Is this grounded? (trace to verifiable)"
      - "Is this self-consistent? (apply to self)"
      - "Do others agree? (check convergence)"
      - "Does it work? (check outcomes)"
      - "If all yes: accept. If mixed: investigate disagreement."

    ## Convergent Validation Result

    **Claim/Output**: [what is being validated]

    | Check | Result | Notes |
    |-------|--------|-------|
    | Grounding | PASS/FAIL/FLAG | [tracing notes] |
    | Fixed-Point | PASS/FAIL/FLAG | [self-application notes] |
    | Convergence | PASS/FAIL/FLAG | [agreement notes] |
    | Practical | PASS/FAIL/FLAG | [outcome notes] |

    **Agreement**: [X of 4 pass]
    **Decision**: [Accept / Accept with caveat / Investigate / Reject]
    **Remaining Uncertainty**: [what isn't resolved]

# ============================================
# LIMITATIONS
# ============================================

limitations:
  - The four checks share some assumptions (e.g., that grounding is possible)
  - '"Independence" is approximate, not perfect'
  - "Doesn't guarantee correctness, only convergent evidence"
  - Requires effort to apply all four checks
  - Legitimate criticisms may still be missed

honest_assessment: |
  This procedure doesn't solve the n+1 problem definitively.
  It makes progress by:
  1. Using multiple independent criteria (harder to defeat all)
  2. Making uncertainty explicit (not hiding disagreement)
  3. Providing termination conditions (when to stop)
  4. Acknowledging limitations (not claiming perfection)

  The remaining uncertainty is irreducible. Operating well under
  irreducible uncertainty is the best achievable outcome.
