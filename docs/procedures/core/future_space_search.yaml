name: Future Space Search
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core

goal: |
  Generate a comprehensive space of possible futures,
  then search for most likely, most desirable, or most important to prepare for.

description: |
  The future is uncertain but not arbitrary.
  Systematically generate possible futures, then:
  - Find most likely (prediction)
  - Find most desirable (goal-setting)
  - Find most important to prepare for (risk management)

when_to_use:
  - Strategic planning
  - Risk assessment
  - Scenario planning
  - Decision-making under uncertainty
  - Preparing for multiple outcomes
