  An honest audit of GOSM's approach, claims, and limitations.
  Applying the unassailable standard to the system itself.

# ============================================
# WHAT GOSM CLAIMS
# ============================================

claims:

  claim_1:
    statement: "Procedures extracted from books can improve LLM reasoning"
    strength: Moderate
    attack_vectors:
      - "Tacit knowledge doesn't transfer via explicit procedures"
      - "LLMs already know this - procedures are redundant"
      - "Context-dependence means procedures don't generalize"
    defense:
      - "Procedures constrain reasoning, preventing bad patterns"
      - "External procedures can be questioned/audited unlike implicit knowledge"
      - "Compression makes knowledge more accessible, not less valuable"
    verdict: |
      Defensible but unproven. The claim is that procedures help, not that
      they're sufficient. Empirical testing needed.

  claim_2:
    statement: "Meta-procedures (how to think) are more valuable than content procedures (what to do)"
    strength: Strong
    attack_vectors:
      - "Without content, meta-procedures are empty"
      - "How do you know meta is better without testing both?"
    defense:
      - "Meta-procedures apply across domains, content is domain-specific"
      - "Meta-procedures enable correct use of content procedures"
      - "Quality of 10 meta-procedures > quantity of 10,000 content procedures (if content is applied badly)"
    verdict: |
      Defensible. The hierarchy (meta > content) is architecturally sound.
      Content is still needed but subordinate to meta.

  claim_3:
    statement: "The unassailable standard produces better outputs"
    strength: Strong
    attack_vectors:
      - "Too strict - may produce nothing"
      - "Who decides what's unassailable?"
      - "Unassailable ≠ useful"
    defense:
      - "Zero questionable outputs > many casual outputs (for important decisions)"
      - "Symmetric critic (critic must also be unassailable) handles 'who decides'"
      - "If unassailable AND useful is possible, that's the target"
    verdict: |
      Defensible as an aspiration. The standard is strict intentionally.
      Producing nothing is better than producing wrong.

  claim_4:
    statement: "Gates and procedures can prevent bad LLM decisions"
    strength: Moderate
    attack_vectors:
      - "LLM can ignore or misapply gates"
      - "Gates add overhead without guaranteed benefit"
      - "Garbage in, garbage out - gates can't fix bad input"
    defense:
      - "External checkpoints are auditable"
      - "Gates make decision points explicit"
      - "Overhead is worth it for important decisions"
    verdict: |
      Defensible for important decisions. Overhead may not be worth it
      for trivial tasks. Need to specify when to apply.

  claim_5:
    statement: "Recursive causal interrogation (RCI) is a reliable reasoning method"
    strength: Moderate
    attack_vectors:
      - "Infinite regress possible"
      - "What about intuition, pattern recognition, empirical investigation?"
      - "Not all problems are causal"
    defense:
      - "RCI has termination criteria (brute fact, loop, emergence)"
      - "RCI is one method, not the only method"
      - "Claims about RCI being 'THE key' have been softened"
    verdict: |
      Defensible as one method among several. Not a universal solution.

  claim_6:
    statement: "The epistemic hierarchy provides reliable certainty levels"
    strength: Strong
    attack_vectors:
      - "Level 0 is too thin to derive anything useful"
      - "The gap between levels is where uncertainty hides"
    defense:
      - "The hierarchy acknowledges that lower levels are uncertain"
      - "It doesn't claim to derive useful content from Level 0 alone"
      - "It classifies certainty, doesn't inflate it"
    verdict: |
      Defensible. The hierarchy is descriptive (what certainty levels exist)
      not prescriptive (what to do with them).

# ============================================
# WHAT GOSM CANNOT DO
# ============================================

limitations:

  limitation_1:
    name: "Cannot generate domain-specific strategies"
    description: |
      GOSM provides framework (how to think) not content (what to do).
      It can't tell you the correct health intervention, career move, etc.
    implication: |
      Need domain knowledge + GOSM framework. GOSM alone is insufficient.
    status: Acknowledged in system_gaps_and_scaling.md

  limitation_2:
    name: "Cannot validate its own outputs"
    description: |
      GOSM can produce recommendations but can't verify they're correct
      without external feedback.
    implication: |
      Need empirical testing and outcome tracking.
    status: Acknowledged. Convergent validation helps but doesn't solve.

  limitation_3:
    name: "Cannot solve the n+1 critic problem definitively"
    description: |
      Any termination criterion can be criticized.
      Convergent validation helps but doesn't eliminate the problem.
    implication: |
      Must operate under irreducible uncertainty. Make uncertainty explicit.
    status: Acknowledged. Convergent validation is best available approach.

  limitation_4:
    name: "Cannot account for individual context automatically"
    description: |
      Generic procedures don't know your specific situation, history,
      constraints, preferences.
    implication: |
      Need personal calibration and context-specific application.
    status: Acknowledged. This is user's responsibility.

  limitation_5:
    name: "Untested at scale"
    description: |
      GOSM is a theoretical framework with limited real-world testing.
      120+ versions of pure_regress suggest iteration without convergence.
    implication: |
      Claims about effectiveness are theoretical, not empirical.
    status: This audit acknowledges this. Testing needed.

# ============================================
# HONEST ASSESSMENT
# ============================================

honest_assessment:

  what_gosm_is:
    - "A framework for thinking about how to think"
    - "A collection of procedures for constraining reasoning"
    - "A set of gates for explicit decision checkpoints"
    - "A meta-level system, not a content system"

  what_gosm_is_not:
    - "An oracle that tells you what to do"
    - "A replacement for domain expertise"
    - "Proven to produce better outcomes"
    - "Complete or finished"

  the_core_bet: |
    GOSM bets that explicit procedures, gates, and meta-reasoning
    produce better outcomes than implicit intuition for complex decisions.

    This bet is reasonable but unproven.

    The appropriate response is: test it. Track outcomes. Compare to baseline.

  what_would_invalidate_gosm: |
    1. If applying GOSM produces worse outcomes than intuition
    2. If the overhead exceeds the benefit
    3. If the meta-procedures are fundamentally flawed
    4. If the n+1 problem makes any termination impossible

    So far, none of these have been demonstrated. But neither has GOSM
    been validated.

  what_would_validate_gosm: |
    1. Applying to real goals with measurable outcomes
    2. Better outcomes than baseline/intuition
    3. Acceptable overhead for the benefit
    4. Convergent evidence across multiple tests

# ============================================
# THE AUDIT'S OWN LIMITATIONS
# ============================================

audit_limitations:
  - "Self-audit has bias - may be too lenient or too harsh"
  - "External audit would be stronger but not available"
  - "This audit is one person's perspective at one time"
  - "The audit itself can be audited (n+1 applies here too)"

response_to_limitations: |
    These limitations are acknowledged, not hidden.
    The audit applies the symmetric critic: criticisms of the audit
    must also be defensible.

    "Self-audit is biased" is true but the alternative (no audit) is worse.
    "External audit is stronger" is true but not available.

    This audit is better than nothing. It is not presented as definitive.

# ============================================
# RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
# ============================================

recommended_next_steps:

  high_priority:
    - action: "Pick one specific, measurable goal and apply GOSM fully"
      rationale: "Empirical testing is needed. Theory without testing is speculation."
      deliverable: "Documented application with predictions, tracking, outcomes"

    - action: "Compare outcomes to baseline"
      rationale: "Need to know if GOSM is better than intuition"
      deliverable: "Comparison analysis"

  medium_priority:
    - action: "Update extraction pipeline with unassailable standard"
      rationale: "Future extractions should meet higher quality bar"
      deliverable: "Modified extraction script with v6 prompts"

    - action: "Triage existing procedure library"
      rationale: "18,000 procedures of varying quality. Identify high-quality subset."
      deliverable: "Stratified library with quality ratings"

  low_priority:
    - action: "Build domain-specific causal models"
      rationale: "GOSM framework needs domain content to be useful"
      deliverable: "One domain's causal model as proof of concept"

    - action: "Meta-analysis of pure_regress versions"
      rationale: "120+ versions suggest something. Understand what."
      deliverable: "Analysis document"

# ============================================
# APPLYING CONVERGENT VALIDATION TO THIS AUDIT
# ============================================

convergent_validation_of_audit:

  grounding_check:
    result: PASS
    notes: |
      Claims trace to observable facts (code exists, procedures exist,
      system_gaps_and_scaling.md exists and says these things).
      Assessments are grounded in specific file contents.

  fixed_point_check:
    result: PASS
    notes: |
      The audit acknowledges its own limitations (self-referential).
      Applying "audit the approach" to "audit the approach" produces
      the limitation section, which is consistent.

  convergence_check:
    result: PARTIAL
    notes: |
      This is one person's audit. No independent audits to converge with.
      However, the system_gaps_and_scaling.md reached similar conclusions
      through different process, which is weak convergence.

  practical_check:
    result: UNKNOWN
    notes: |
      This audit is newly created. No outcome data yet.
      Practical value will be determined by whether it helps improve GOSM.

  overall:
    agreement: "2 pass, 1 partial, 1 unknown"
    decision: "Accept with moderate confidence. Convergence and practical checks need more evidence."
