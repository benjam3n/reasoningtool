  Many activities not traditionally framed as "search" can be productively
  reinterpreted through the search lens. This file:
  1. Extends the search paradigm to non-obvious domains
  2. Identifies which search methods should become procedures
  3. Prioritizes by "intelligence reduction" - which structures do all the work

  questioning_as_search:
    description: "Asking questions is search through answer space"

    reframe: |
      A question defines a search space (possible answers) and
      criteria (what would satisfy the question).

      Asking the RIGHT question = defining the RIGHT search space.
      This is why question quality matters more than answer quality.

    types:
      - name: "Clarifying Questions"
        search_for: "The actual meaning/intent"
        space: "Possible interpretations"
        strategy: "Eliminate ambiguity"

      - name: "Diagnostic Questions"
        search_for: "Root cause"
        space: "Possible causes"
        strategy: "Binary search through cause tree"

      - name: "Socratic Questions"
        search_for: "Hidden assumptions, contradictions"
        space: "Belief structure"
        strategy: "Follow implications until inconsistency"

      - name: "Generative Questions"
        search_for: "New possibilities"
        space: "Adjacent possible"
        strategy: "Expand search space itself"

      - name: "Convergent Questions"
        search_for: "Single best answer"
        space: "Known options"
        strategy: "Narrow down"

      - name: "Divergent Questions"
        search_for: "Many possible answers"
        space: "Unbounded"
        strategy: "Expand"

    key_insight: |
      The quality of search is bounded by the quality of the question.
      "What's the answer?" assumes a single answer exists.
      "What are the possible answers?" searches more broadly.
      "Is this the right question?" is meta-search.

  consciousness_as_search:
    description: "Awareness might be a search process"

    reframe: |
      Consciousness could be understood as:
      - Search for relevant information (attention)
      - Search for coherent interpretation (perception)
      - Search for appropriate response (action selection)
      - Search for self-model consistency (self-awareness)

    components:
      - name: "Attention"
        search_for: "What matters right now"
        space: "All sensory input + memory"
        strategy: "Relevance filtering, salience detection"
        bandwidth: "~40 bits/second conscious, 10^7 bits/second unconscious"

      - name: "Perception"
        search_for: "Best interpretation of sensory data"
        space: "Possible world-states"
        strategy: "Predictive processing, hypothesis testing"
        evidence: "Perception is inference, not direct access"

      - name: "Working Memory"
        search_for: "Relevant items to hold active"
        space: "All memory"
        strategy: "Chunking, rehearsal"
        limit: "~4 items"

      - name: "Stream of Consciousness"
        search_for: "Next thought"
        space: "Associatively connected thoughts"
        strategy: "Spreading activation, relevance"
        nature: "Continuous search, not static state"

      - name: "Self-Model"
        search_for: "Who am I? What do I want?"
        space: "Possible self-interpretations"
        strategy: "Narrative coherence"
        function: "Prediction of own behavior"

    speculative: |
      If consciousness is search, then:
      - Meditation = changing search parameters
      - Flow state = search locked onto relevant space
      - Mind-wandering = undirected search
      - Insight = search breakthrough
      - Dreams = search without reality constraints

  prediction_as_search:
    description: "Prediction is search through future possibility space"

    reframe: |
      Prediction = "Given what I know, what will happen?"
      This is searching the space of possible futures for the most likely one.

    types:
      - name: "Extrapolation"
        search_for: "Continuation of pattern"
        space: "Possible continuations"
        strategy: "Extend trend"

      - name: "Simulation"
        search_for: "Outcome of process"
        space: "Possible end states"
        strategy: "Run model forward"

      - name: "Analogy-Based"
        search_for: "Similar past situations"
        space: "Historical cases"
        strategy: "Match and transfer"

      - name: "Model-Based"
        search_for: "Implications of model"
        space: "Model's output space"
        strategy: "Deduction from model"

      - name: "Ensemble"
        search_for: "Robust prediction"
        space: "Multiple model outputs"
        strategy: "Combine diverse predictions"

    key_insight: |
      Better prediction = better search through:
      1. Better space definition (what could happen)
      2. Better evaluation (how likely is each)
      3. Better strategy (how to explore efficiently)

      A good predictive model IS a search space definition.

  communication_as_search:
    description: "Communication is mutual search for shared understanding"

    reframe: |
      Communication = two agents searching for:
      - Common ground (shared knowledge)
      - Right words (expressions that map to intended meaning)
      - Successful transmission (did they get it?)

    components:
      - name: "Word Selection"
        search_for: "Expression that maps to intended meaning"
        space: "Vocabulary + combinations"
        strategy: "Match meaning to available expressions"

      - name: "Common Ground Search"
        search_for: "What does the other know?"
        space: "Possible knowledge states"
        strategy: "Theory of mind, inference from responses"

      - name: "Interpretation"
        search_for: "What did they mean?"
        space: "Possible intended meanings"
        strategy: "Context + literal meaning + pragmatics"

      - name: "Clarification"
        search_for: "Mutual understanding"
        space: "Possible misunderstandings"
        strategy: "Check, repair, confirm"

      - name: "Persuasion"
        search_for: "Arguments that will convince"
        space: "Possible argument paths"
        strategy: "Model other's beliefs, find leverage points"

    key_insight: |
      Communication failure = search failure
      - Didn't find common ground
      - Didn't find right expression
      - Didn't find intended interpretation

      Better communication = better search heuristics for meaning.

  learning_as_search:
    description: "Learning is search through hypothesis/skill space"

    reframe: |
      Learning = finding a model/skill that works
      This is search through the space of possible models/skills.

    types:
      - name: "Supervised Learning"
        search_for: "Function that maps inputs to outputs"
        space: "Function space (model class)"
        strategy: "Minimize error on examples"

      - name: "Unsupervised Learning"
        search_for: "Structure in data"
        space: "Possible structures (clusters, dimensions, etc.)"
        strategy: "Optimize internal criteria"

      - name: "Reinforcement Learning"
        search_for: "Policy that maximizes reward"
        space: "Policy space"

      - name: "Skill Acquisition"
        search_for: "Motor program that achieves goal"
        space: "Possible movement patterns"
        strategy: "Practice with feedback"

        search_for: "Rule that captures category"
        space: "Possible rules"

        space: "Known situations"
        strategy: "Structure mapping"
        property: "Similarity-based"

  creativity_as_search:
    description: "Creativity is search through novelty space"

    reframe: |
      Creativity = finding novel combinations that are valuable.
      This is search with two criteria: novelty AND value.

    types:
      - name: "Combinatorial"
        search_for: "New combinations of existing elements"
        space: "Combinations of known elements"
        strategy: "Systematic or random combination"

      - name: "Exploratory"
        search_for: "Possibilities within a style/space"
        space: "Defined creative space"

        search_strategy: "Expand search space by removing constraints"

      - name: "Analogy"
        search_strategy: "Import solution from distant domain"

  emotion_as_search:
    description: "Emotions guide search by providing evaluation signals"

    reframe: |
      Emotions might be search heuristics:
      - Fear = "Search for escape/avoidance"
      - Curiosity = "Search for information"
      - Frustration = "Current search strategy failing"
      - Satisfaction = "Search goal reached"
      - Anxiety = "Search space feels too large/uncertain"

    function: |
      Emotions provide fast evaluation without deliberation.
      They're pre-computed search guidance:
      - What to approach (positive emotion)
      - What to avoid (negative emotion)
      - What to explore (curiosity)
      - What to exploit (satisfaction)

  decision_making_as_search:
    description: "Deciding is searching for the best option"

    reframe: |
      Decision = search through options for best one
      - Define option space
      - Define evaluation criteria
      - Search for maximum

    complexity:
      - single_criterion: "Search for maximum on one dimension"
      - multi_criteria: "Search Pareto frontier"
      - uncertainty: "Search expected value or robust option"
      - strategic: "Search Nash equilibrium"

  memory_as_search_infrastructure:
    description: "Memory is a searchable database of experience"

    reframe: |
      Memory = the search space for cognition
      - Episodic memory = searchable event database
      - Semantic memory = searchable fact database
      - Procedural memory = searchable skill database

      Memory retrieval = search query
      Forgetting = pruning search space
      Consolidation = reorganizing for better search

  language_as_search_tool:
    description: "Language compresses and structures search"

    reframe: |
      Words are pointers to concepts, enabling:
      - Compression: "chair" vs describing every chair
      - Communication: share search results
      - Reasoning: manipulate symbols = manipulate search space

      Language enables "search by reference" - point to a region
      of concept space without exhaustively describing it.

  understanding_as_search:
    description: "Understanding is finding a model that fits"

    reframe: |
      "I understand X" = "I found a model of X that:
      - Explains observations
      - Makes correct predictions
      - Connects to other knowledge
      - Feels coherent"

      Understanding is search through model space for one that fits.

# PROCEDURE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# ============================================

procedure_design_for_intelligence_reduction:
  principle_1:
    name: "Enumerate, Don't Generate"
    description: |
      Provide lists to select from rather than asking for generation.
      "Which of these 10 applies?" vs "What might apply?"
    intelligence_reduction: "High"

  principle_2:
    name: "Compare, Don't Evaluate Absolutely"
    description: |
      "Is A better than B?" is easier than "How good is A?"
      Relative judgments are more reliable than absolute ones.
    intelligence_reduction: "Medium-High"

  principle_3:
    name: "Decompose Into Binary"
    description: |
      Turn complex decisions into series of yes/no questions.
      Each question is trivial; sequence finds answer.
    intelligence_reduction: "Very High"

  principle_4:
    name: "Provide Transformations"
    description: |
      Give specific operations to apply.
      "Reverse this" vs "Think of alternatives"
    intelligence_reduction: "High"

  principle_5:
    name: "Make Criteria Explicit"
    description: |
      Define exactly what "good" means.
      Removes need for judgment about quality.
    intelligence_reduction: "High"

  principle_6:
    name: "Constrain Output Format"
    description: |
      Specify exactly what output looks like.
      Fill-in-blank vs open-ended.
    intelligence_reduction: "Very High"

  principle_7:
    name: "Provide Exhaustive Options"
    description: |
      If the option space is finite, list all options.
      Selection is easier than generation.
    intelligence_reduction: "Very High"

  principle_8:
    name: "Use Mechanical Aggregation"
    description: |
      Sum, average, count - not "synthesize" or "integrate."
      Math doesn't require intelligence.
    intelligence_reduction: "Very High"

# META-OBSERVATION
# ============================================

  The search paradigm unifies many cognitive activities:
  - Questions = search space definition
  - Answers = search results
  - Understanding = finding fitting model
  - Creativity = search in novelty space
  - Decision = search for best option
  - Learning = search for good model
  - Communication = search for shared understanding
  - Prediction = search through future space
  - Reasoning = search through inference space
  - Memory = searchable database
  - Attention = search relevance filter
  - Consciousness = ongoing search process

  If this unification is valid, then:
  1. All cognitive improvement = search improvement
  2. GOSM procedures = search algorithms for human cognition
  3. Intelligence reduction = making search trivial via structure
  4. The goal of GOSM = provide search structures so good that intelligence is unnecessary

  The most valuable procedures are those where:
  - Search space is well-defined
  - Search strategy is mechanical
  - Evaluation criteria are explicit
  - Output format is constrained

  These procedures "do all the work" - the executor just follows instructions.
