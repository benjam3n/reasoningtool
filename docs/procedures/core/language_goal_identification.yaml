description: |
  All language has a goal - it's trying to achieve something.
  This procedure identifies what that goal is, which enables:
  - Evaluation of whether the language achieves its goal
  - Understanding WHY something was said
  - Filtering illegitimate or confused communication

core_principle: |
  The goal of language is more sophisticated than surface categories
  like "inform," "persuade," "express." The deeper question is:
  What state is the speaker trying to bring about?

# ============================================
# GOAL LAYERS
# ============================================

goal_layers:
  surface_layer:
    description: The obvious, grammatical function
    categories:
      - Declarative: States something
      - Interrogative: Asks something
      - Imperative: Commands something
      - Exclamatory: Expresses something
    limitation: |
      Too shallow. A declarative sentence can persuade.
      A question can assert. Surface doesn't reveal goal.

  functional_layer:
    description: What the language is functionally doing
    categories:
      - Inform: Transfer information
      - Persuade: Change belief/behavior
      - Express: Communicate internal state
      - Direct: Get someone to do something
      - Commit: Bind the speaker to something
      - Declare: Make something the case by saying it
    limitation: |
      Better, but still doesn't capture the FULL goal.
      WHY inform? WHY persuade? What's the deeper need?

  need_layer:
    description: What need the speaker is trying to meet
    categories:
      - Epistemic: Need to know/understand
      - Practical: Need to act/decide
      - Social: Need for connection/recognition
      - Emotional: Need to process/express feeling
      - Defensive: Need to protect self/position
      - Strategic: Need to achieve specific outcome
    insight: |
      This layer reveals WHY the functional goal is pursued.
      "I'm informing you" → WHY? → "So you can help me" → Practical need.

  intrinsic_layer:
    description: The foundational values being served
    examples:
      - Wellbeing (for self or others)
      - Truth/knowledge
      - Connection/belonging
      - Security/safety
      - Meaning/purpose
    insight: |
      This is where goal-tracing terminates.
      "Why do you want X?" → Eventually → "Because I value Y intrinsically."

# ============================================
# THE PROCEDURE
# ============================================

steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Receive the language
    action: |
      Take the statement, question, or communication to analyze.
      Note the exact wording and context.

  - id: 2
    name: Identify surface layer
    action: |
      What is the grammatical form?
      - Declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory?

      This is the starting point, not the answer.

  - id: 3
    name: Identify functional layer
    action: |
      What is this language DOING?

      Ask: If this language "succeeds," what has changed?
      - Someone knows something they didn't? (Inform)
      - Someone believes something they didn't? (Persuade)
      - Someone does something they wouldn't have? (Direct)
      - A relationship state changes? (Social function)
      - The speaker has expressed something? (Express)

  - id: 4
    name: Identify need layer
    action: |
      WHY is the speaker pursuing this function?

      Ask: What need is met if the function succeeds?
      - Need to know/understand? (Epistemic)
      - Need to act/decide? (Practical)
      - Need for connection? (Social)
      - Need to process feeling? (Emotional)
      - Need to protect position? (Defensive)
      - Need specific outcome? (Strategic)

  - id: 5
    name: Trace to intrinsic layer (if needed)
    action: |
      For deeper analysis, ask: WHY this need?

      Keep asking "why?" until reaching intrinsic values:
      - Wellbeing, truth, connection, security, meaning, etc.

      This is optional for most applications but necessary for
      goal-structure reconstruction.

  - id: 6
    name: State the goal
    action: |
      Synthesize the layers into a goal statement:

      "[Speaker] is [doing X] because they [need Y] in service of [value Z]."

      Or shorter: "The goal is [Y]."

# ============================================
# APPLICATIONS
# ============================================

applications:
  evaluating_questions:
    description: Determine if a question is worth engaging
    method: |
      1. Identify the goal of the question
      2. Evaluate if the goal is legitimate
      3. Evaluate if this question serves the goal
      4. Engage or request clarification

  evaluating_criticisms:
    description: Determine if a criticism is legitimate
    method: |
      1. Identify the goal of the criticism
      2. If goal is epistemic improvement → legitimate
      3. If goal is defensive/strategic without substance → filter
      4. If goal unclear → request clarification

  understanding_disagreement:
    description: Clarify what's actually being disagreed about
    method: |
      1. Identify goal of each party's statements
      2. Are they pursuing the same goal? (substantive disagreement)
      3. Are they pursuing different goals? (talking past each other)
      4. Address the actual disagreement

  improving_own_communication:
    description: Ensure your language achieves its goal
    method: |
      1. Identify your goal before speaking
      2. Choose language that serves that goal
      3. Check if the listener understood the goal
      4. Adjust if goal is being misread

# ============================================
# EXAMPLES
# ============================================

examples:
  example_1:
    language: "I think therefore I am"
    surface: Declarative (states something)
    functional: Inform (transfers a conclusion)
    need: Epistemic (establish certain knowledge) + Defensive (counter skepticism)
    intrinsic: Truth, security of knowledge
    goal_statement: |
      Descartes is asserting a conclusion to establish that at least one thing
      can be known with certainty, countering radical skepticism, in service
      of building reliable knowledge (epistemic security).

  example_2:
    language: "But how do you REALLY know?"
    surface: Interrogative (asks something)
    functional: Challenge (tests a claim)
    need: Could be epistemic (genuine inquiry) OR defensive (protect own position) OR aggressive (undermine without offering alternative)
    goal_unclear: |
      Need to ask: What would satisfy this question?
      If nothing would satisfy → not genuine epistemic need
      If specific answer would satisfy → legitimate inquiry

  example_3:
    language: "We should reduce carbon emissions"
    surface: Declarative (states something)
    functional: Persuade/Direct (change behavior)
    need: Practical (address climate problem) + Social (collective action)
    intrinsic: Wellbeing, survival, responsibility to future
    goal_statement: |
      Speaker is advocating for action because of practical need to address
      climate change, in service of wellbeing and responsibility.

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO MISSION
# ============================================

mission_connection: |
  This procedure operationalizes the mission statement's insight that
  "all language has a goal." By identifying goals:

  1. Statements become evaluable (does it achieve the goal?)
  2. Questions become filterable (is the goal legitimate?)
  3. Conclusions become understandable (why was this said?)
  4. Criticisms become assessable (is this serving inquiry?)

  This is foundational to bounded inquiry and n+1 termination.
