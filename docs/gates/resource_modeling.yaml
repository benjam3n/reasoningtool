# GOSM v2: Resource Modeling Framework
# Tracks binding constraints: time, money, energy, dependencies, opportunity cost

resource_framework:
  purpose: |
    Track the resources that actually constrain goals.
    Plans often fail not because of poor strategy but because of resource constraints.

  dimensions:

    # TIME
    # ============================================
    time:
      questions:
        available: "How much time can be allocated to this?"
