  Gate for calibrating appropriate trust level in a relationship/situation.

  The tension: Too much trust enables exploitation. Too little trust
  prevents cooperation. This gate helps find the right calibration.

when_to_use:
  - Starting new relationships/partnerships
  - Evaluating existing relationships
  - Deciding how much to rely on others
  - Setting verification/oversight levels

# ============================================
# CURRENT TRUST ASSESSMENT
# ============================================
current_state:
  description: What is the current trust situation?

  trust_level:
    - "What is your current trust level? (NONE, LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, COMPLETE)"
    - "What is this level based on?"
    - "How confident are you in this assessment?"

  trust_basis:
    - "Is trust based on track record (evidence) or assumption?"
    - "How long have you observed this party?"
    - "In what contexts have you observed them?"
    - "Have they been tested in situations where defection was tempting?"

  trust_asymmetry:
    - "Do they trust you? To what degree?"
    - "Is trust reciprocal or one-directional?"
    - "Who is more vulnerable in this relationship?"

# TRUSTWORTHINESS INDICATORS
# ============================================
trustworthiness_indicators:
  description: What signals trustworthiness?

  positive_indicators:
    behavioral:
      - "Keeps commitments even when inconvenient"
      - "Discloses negative information proactively"
      - "Admits mistakes and uncertainty"
      - "Actions match stated intentions"
      - "Consistent behavior across contexts"

    structural:
      - "Reputation matters to them (repeated game)"
      - "Interests are aligned with yours"
      - "Defection is detectable"
      - "Defection has consequences for them"
      - "They've invested in the relationship"

    situational:
      - "They've had opportunities to defect and didn't"
      - "They've sacrificed for the relationship"
      - "They've taken risks based on trusting you"

  negative_indicators:
    behavioral:
      - "Commitments not kept"
      - "Negative information hidden until discovered"
      - "Excuses rather than accountability"
      - "Says different things to different audiences"
      - "Behavior changes based on who's watching"

    structural:
      - "One-time interaction (no reputation stake)"
      - "Interests are opposed to yours"
      - "Defection is hard to detect"
      - "No consequences for defection"
      - "No investment in relationship"

    situational:
      - "They've defected before"
      - "They've exploited others' trust"
      - "They're in desperate circumstances (high temptation)"

# ============================================
# TRUST COST-BENEFIT
# ============================================
trust_costs_benefits:
  description: What are the stakes?

  cost_of_misplaced_trust:
    - "What happens if you trust and they defect?"
    - "Is the damage recoverable?"
    - "What is the magnitude of potential loss?"
    - "Does trust create vulnerability?"

  cost_of_misplaced_distrust:
    - "What happens if you distrust and they were trustworthy?"
    - "What cooperation opportunities are lost?"
    - "Does distrust become self-fulfilling?"
    - "What is the cost of verification/protection?"

  asymmetry:
    - "Which mistake is more costly: trust too much or trust too little?"
    - "Can you afford to be wrong in either direction?"
    - "What is the default when uncertain?"

# ============================================
# CALIBRATION STRATEGIES
# ============================================
calibration_strategies:
  description: How to calibrate trust appropriately

  graduated_trust:
    description: "Build trust incrementally"
    method: |
      1. Start with low-stakes trust (testable)
      2. Observe behavior under temptation
      3. Increase trust if passed, decrease if failed
      4. Never skip steps (don't jump to high trust)
    questions:
      - "What low-stakes test could you start with?"
      - "What would success look like?"
      - "What would failure look like?"
      - "What's the next level if they pass?"

  trust_but_verify:
    description: "Trust for cooperation, verify for protection"
    method: |
      1. Extend trust to enable cooperation
      2. Maintain monitoring to detect defection
      3. Make monitoring visible (deters defection)
      4. Reduce monitoring as trust is earned
    questions:
      - "What verification is appropriate?"
      - "Is verification visible or hidden?"
      - "What triggers increased verification?"
      - "What triggers decreased verification?"

  conditional_trust:
    description: "Trust contingent on specific conditions"
    method: |
      1. Identify conditions that make trust safe
      2. Extend trust when conditions hold
      3. Withdraw trust when conditions change
      4. Be explicit about conditions
    questions:
      - "What conditions make trust appropriate?"
      - "How would you know if conditions changed?"
      - "What's the response to condition change?"

  distributed_trust:
    description: "Don't put all trust in one party"
    method: |
      1. Spread vulnerability across multiple parties
      2. No single defection is catastrophic
      3. Creates redundancy and cross-checking
      4. Reduces temptation (less to gain from defection)
    questions:
      - "Is trust concentrated or distributed?"
      - "What happens if any single party defects?"
      - "Can trust be spread further?"

# ============================================
# DECISION LOGIC
# ============================================
decision_logic: |
  INCREASE TRUST if:
  - Track record is positive (passed tests)
  - Structural incentives favor trustworthiness
  - Cost of misplaced distrust exceeds cost of misplaced trust
  - Current verification is burdensome with low return

  DECREASE TRUST if:
  - Red flags observed (behavioral or structural)
  - Circumstances changed (one-time situation, desperate)
  - Cost of misplaced trust exceeds cost of misplaced distrust
  - They're in position to do significant harm

  MAINTAIN CURRENT LEVEL if:
  - No new information
  - Current calibration is working
  - Costs are balanced

  USE GRADUATED APPROACH if:
  - New relationship, uncertain trustworthiness
  - High stakes, need to build trust safely
  - Previous trust was violated, testing recovery

# ============================================
# RECALIBRATION TRIGGERS
# ============================================
recalibration_triggers:
  increase_trust:
    - "Kept commitment when defection was tempting"
    - "Proactively disclosed negative information"
    - "Sacrificed for the relationship"
    - "Defended you when it cost them"

  decrease_trust:
    - "Commitment not kept"
    - "Discovered hidden negative information"
    - "Behavior changed when stakes increased"
    - "Evidence of deception"
    - "Circumstances changed (desperation, one-time)"

  reassess_entirely:
    - "Discovered information that changes interpretation of past"
    - "Context has fundamentally changed"
    - "Relationship structure has changed"
