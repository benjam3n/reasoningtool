# Value Conflict Gate
# Purpose: Ensure value conflicts are identified and addressed before strategy selection
# Version: 1.0.0

id: value_conflict_gate
name: Value Conflict Gate
version: "1.0.0"
domain: gates
phase: strategy

description: |
  This gate checks whether value conflicts have been identified and addressed
  before committing to a strategy. Many stuck goals are stuck because of
  unacknowledged value conflicts, not because of execution problems.

when_applied: "Before final strategy selection, after goal chain analysis"

pass_criteria:
  required:
    - name: "Conflict Scan Complete"
      question: "Have you checked whether this goal serves conflicting values?"
      pass_if: "Yes, conflict scan was performed"

    - name: "Conflicts Named"
      question: "If conflicts exist, are they explicitly named and described?"
      pass_if: "No conflicts found, OR conflicts are named using Value A vs Value B format"

    - name: "Navigation Strategy Selected"
      question: "If conflicts exist, has a navigation strategy been selected?"
      pass_if: "No conflicts found, OR navigation strategy selected from: temporal_sequencing, partial_satisfaction, domain_separation, reframing, integration, dynamic_balancing, acceptance"

  recommended:
    - name: "Strategy Addresses Both Values"
      question: "Does the selected strategy honor both conflicting values?"
      pass_if: "Strategy design shows how both values are served"

    - name: "Check-in Points Defined"
      question: "Are there check-in points to assess if navigation is working?"
      pass_if: "Specific times/triggers for reviewing the conflict navigation"

on_pass: "Proceed to strategy commitment"
on_fail: "Return to value_conflict_decomposition procedure"

# ============================================
# QUICK SCAN QUESTIONS
# ============================================

quick_scan:
  description: "Fast check for common value conflicts"

  questions:
    - question: "Does achieving this goal require risking something you want to protect?"
      if_yes: "Possible Security vs Achievement conflict"

    - question: "Does achieving this goal require commitment that limits options?"
      if_yes: "Possible Freedom vs Security conflict"

    - question: "Does achieving this goal require less time with people you care about?"
      if_yes: "Possible Individual vs Relational conflict"

    - question: "Does achieving this goal require doing things that aren't enjoyable?"
      if_yes: "Possible Meaning vs Pleasure conflict"

    - question: "Are you trying to get a result but also want to enjoy the process?"
      if_yes: "Possible Process vs Outcome conflict"

    - question: "Does achieving this goal require staying in your expertise vs exploring new areas?"
      if_yes: "Possible Known vs Unknown conflict"

  interpretation: |
    If any questions are "yes", a value conflict may be present.
    This doesn't mean the goal is bad - it means the conflict should be acknowledged and navigated.
