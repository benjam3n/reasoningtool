  Gate for predicting whether transparency will enable or prevent outcomes.

  The tension: Transparency can build trust that enables cooperation.
  But it can also enable exploitation that prevents success.
  This gate helps predict which effect will dominate.

when_to_use:
  - Designing negotiation strategies
  - Setting organizational transparency policies
  - Deciding what to reveal to competitors/adversaries
  - Evaluating trust-building approaches

# ============================================
# CONTEXT ASSESSMENT
# ============================================
context:
  description: What is the situation?

  relationship_type:
    - "What is the nature of the relationship with the other party?"
    - "Is this cooperative, competitive, or mixed?"
    - "Is this a one-time interaction or ongoing?"
    - "What is the power differential?"

  game_structure:
    - "Is this a zero-sum situation (one gains = other loses)?"
    - "Is this positive-sum (can both gain)?"
    - "Are there repeated interactions (reputation matters)?"
    - "Can defection be detected and punished?"

  current_trust_level:
    - "What is the current level of trust?"
    - "Has trust been violated before?"
    - "Is there a history of cooperation or conflict?"
    - "What signals have each party sent about trustworthiness?"

# ============================================
# TRANSPARENCY ENABLING PATHS
# ============================================
enabling_paths:
  description: How might transparency enable success?

  trust_building:
    - "Would transparency signal good faith?"
    - "Would it demonstrate aligned interests?"
    - "Would it reduce the other party's uncertainty about us?"
    - "Would it invite reciprocal transparency?"

  coordination_improvement:
    - "Does the other party need this information to coordinate with us?"
    - "Would shared understanding improve joint outcomes?"
    - "Are we missing opportunities due to information asymmetry?"

  commitment_credibility:
    - "Would transparency make our commitments more credible?"
    - "Would it reduce the other party's need to protect themselves?"
    - "Would it enable agreements that aren't possible with opacity?"

# ============================================
# TRANSPARENCY PREVENTING PATHS
# ============================================
preventing_paths:
  description: How might transparency prevent success?

  exploitation_enabling:
    - "Could the other party use this information against us?"
    - "Do they have incentive to exploit rather than cooperate?"
    - "Would transparency reveal vulnerabilities they would target?"
    - "Is there a competitive element where our information helps them compete?"

  leverage_elimination:
    - "Does uncertainty about us give us leverage?"
    - "Would transparency eliminate strategic ambiguity we need?"
    - "Are we stronger when our capabilities/intentions are unknown?"

  commitment_undermining:
    - "Would transparency reveal that our commitments are contingent?"
    - "Would it expose bluffs or negotiating positions?"
    - "Would it make it harder to walk away?"

# ============================================
# RECIPROCITY ASSESSMENT
# ============================================
reciprocity:
  description: Will transparency be reciprocated?

  questions:
    - "If we are transparent, will they be transparent in return?"
    - "What evidence do we have about their reciprocity pattern?"
    - "What happens if we are transparent and they are not?"
    - "Can we make transparency conditional (reveal if they reveal)?"
    - "Is there a way to test their reciprocity with low-stakes disclosure first?"

# ============================================
# DECISION LOGIC
# ============================================
decision_logic: |
  TRANSPARENCY ENABLES if:
  - Relationship is positive-sum (both can gain from cooperation)
  - Interactions are repeated (reputation matters)
  - Other party has incentive to reciprocate
  - Trust building is more valuable than information protection
  - Defection is detectable and punishable

  TRANSPARENCY PREVENTS if:
  - Relationship is zero-sum (they gain from our loss)
  - One-time interaction (no reputation consequences)
  - Other party has incentive to exploit
  - Information is usable as weapon against us
  - Strategic ambiguity is an asset

  CONDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY if:
  - Both effects are possible depending on their response
  - Can reveal incrementally based on reciprocation
  - Can verify their use of information before revealing more

  SELECTIVE TRANSPARENCY if:
  - Some aspects enable, others prevent
  - Can separate signal (builds trust) from substance (exploitable)
  - Can be transparent about intentions while protecting tactics
