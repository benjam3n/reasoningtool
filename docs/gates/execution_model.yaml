# GOSM v2: Execution Model Framework
# Who/what executes the goal: human, AI, team, automated, hybrid

execution_model:
  purpose: |
    Goals must account for WHO or WHAT will execute them.
    Different executors have different capabilities, constraints, and costs.
    Planning must match the executor's characteristics.

      fix: "Build in explicit verification, clear criteria"

    - mistake: "Planning for human as if unlimited"
      symptom: "Unrealistic hours, no recovery time"
      fix: "Realistic capacity, energy management"

    - mistake: "Team without coordination"
