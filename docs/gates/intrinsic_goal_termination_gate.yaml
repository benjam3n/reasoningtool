# Intrinsic Goal Termination Gate
# Checks if we've reached an intrinsic goal where "why?" regress terminates
# v2.0.0 - Added value elicitation, diverse intrinsic goals, multiple/conflicting goals

id: intrinsic_goal_termination_gate
name: Intrinsic Goal Termination Gate
version: "2.0.0"
domain: core

description: |
  The regress of "why?" terminates at intrinsic goals - things valued
  for themselves, not for what they lead to. This gate checks whether
  we've reached such a goal.

  v2.0 Updates:
  - Diverse intrinsic goals (not just "flourishing")
  - Value elicitation techniques
  - Circularity test for terminus
  - Multiple/conflicting intrinsic goals
  - Anti-flourishing goals as valid

purpose: |
  Provide principled termination for goal-tracing and "why?" chains.
  Intrinsic goals are the terminus because asking "why?" leads to
  circular reasoning - the goal is valued because it's that goal.

# ============================================
# THE GATE
# ============================================

question: Have we reached an intrinsic goal where "why?" terminates?

core_test: |
  **The Circularity Test**:
  Keep asking "What's important to you about X?" or "What does X give you?"

  When the answer circles back to itself, you've reached terminus:
  - "Why do you want pleasure?" → "Because it's pleasurable" (TERMINUS)
  - "Why do you want freedom?" → "Because I value being free" (TERMINUS)
  - "Why do you want security?" → "Because feeling secure matters" (TERMINUS)

  The circular answer indicates: This IS the point. It doesn't serve something else.

# ============================================
# VALUE ELICITATION METHODS
# ============================================

value_elicitation:
  description: |
    Techniques for discovering someone's intrinsic goals.
    Different people have different terminus points.

  methods:
    whats_important:
      question: "What's important to you about [X]?"
      usage: |
        Keep asking until you get circularity:
        "What's important to you about owning a business?"
        → "Freedom from constraints"
        "What's important to you about freedom?"
        → "Being free is what matters to me" (TERMINUS)

    what_does_it_give:
      question: "When you have [X], what does that give you?"
      usage: |
        "When you have success, what does that give you?"
        → "Recognition"
        "When you have recognition, what does that give you?"
        → "I feel valued"
        "When you feel valued, what does that give you?"
        → "That's just what I want" (TERMINUS)

    why_is_that_important:
      question: "Why is [X] important to you?"
      usage: |
        Similar to above, trace until circularity.

    would_you_want_if:
      question: "Would you want [X] even if it led to nothing else?"
      usage: |
        If yes → likely intrinsic
        If no → instrumental, keep tracing

  key_insight: |
    Different people stop at different values:
    - Some stop at FREEDOM
    - Some stop at SECURITY
    - Some stop at CONNECTION
    - Some stop at PLEASURE
    - Some stop at MEANING
    - Some stop at POWER
    - Some stop at PEACE

    There is no "correct" intrinsic goal.
    Intrinsic goals are personal, not universal.

# ============================================
# DIVERSE INTRINSIC GOALS
# ============================================

intrinsic_goal_categories:
  note: |
    "Flourishing" is NOT the only intrinsic goal.
    Below are categories of diverse intrinsic goals.
    People may have one, several, or many.
    They may conflict with each other.

  positive_states:
    description: States people pursue for themselves
    examples:
      - Pleasure / enjoyment
      - Happiness
      - Peace / tranquility
      - Excitement / stimulation
      - Joy

  relational:
    description: Connection-based intrinsic goals
    examples:
      - Love / being loved
      - Connection / belonging
      - Recognition / being seen
      - Acceptance
      - Intimacy

  meaning_based:
    description: Purpose and significance
    examples:
      - Meaning / purpose
      - Significance / mattering
      - Legacy / lasting impact
      - Contribution

  freedom_based:
    description: Autonomy and independence
    examples:
      - Freedom / liberty
      - Autonomy / self-determination
      - Independence
      - Non-constraint

  security_based:
    description: Stability and safety
    examples:
      - Security / safety
      - Stability
      - Predictability
      - Control

  achievement_based:
    description: Accomplishment and mastery
    examples:
      - Achievement / success
      - Mastery / excellence
      - Power / influence
      - Status / respect

  aesthetic:
    description: Beauty and experience
    examples:
      - Beauty / aesthetic experience
      - Novelty / discovery
      - Understanding / knowledge
      - Truth

  anti_flourishing:
    description: |
      Goals that oppose conventional "flourishing."
      These are VALID intrinsic goals for some people.
    examples:
      - Asceticism / self-denial (monks, priests, spiritual seekers)
      - Sacrifice / martyrdom (for a cause)
      - Suffering as meaningful (certain religious traditions)
      - Simplicity / minimalism (rejection of acquisition)
      - Playing to lose (failure as art, anti-success)
      - Victimhood (for some, being wronged is identity-defining)
      - Tradition / purity (even at cost of personal wellbeing)
    note: |
      These may seem strange from outside, but the circularity test
      still applies. If someone says "Why do you want to suffer?"
      and answers "Because suffering purifies" → keep tracing
      But if they answer "Because that's what matters" → terminus

# ============================================
# MULTIPLE AND CONFLICTING GOALS
# ============================================

multiple_intrinsic_goals:
  description: |
    People typically have MULTIPLE intrinsic goals.
    These often CONFLICT with each other.

  examples:
    - "I want freedom AND security" (often trade-offs)
    - "I want achievement AND peace" (often trade-offs)
    - "I want connection AND independence" (often trade-offs)
    - "I want meaning AND pleasure" (can conflict)

  implications:
    - A single goal chain may terminate at multiple intrinsic goals
    - Actions may serve some intrinsic goals while undermining others
    - "Conflicting" chain type exists for this reason
    - Satisfaction may require balancing, not maximizing one

  how_to_handle: |
    When tracing goal chains:
    1. Trace to ALL intrinsic goals, not just the first one
    2. Note conflicts between them
    3. The person must weigh/balance - we can't resolve for them
    4. Different decisions may prioritize different intrinsic goals

# ============================================
# TERMINATING GOAL TYPES
# ============================================

terminating_goal_types:
  intrinsic_values:
    description: Things valued for themselves (see categories above)
    test: |
      "What's important to you about X?"
      If answer circles back → intrinsic, terminate
      If answer points to Y → instrumental, trace Y

  practical_necessities:
    description: Required for functioning regardless of specific goals
    examples:
      - Food/water (biological necessity)
      - Reasoning (epistemic necessity)
      - Agency (action necessity)
    test: |
      "Can you pursue ANY goal without X?"
      If no → practical necessity, terminate
      If yes → not necessary, continue tracing

  transcendental_conditions:
    description: Required for any goal-pursuit to be possible
    examples:
      - Experience exists
      - Distinction/structure exists
      - Preference is possible
    test: |
      Denying this is self-undermining.
      You can't coherently deny X while using X.
      → Transcendental condition, terminate

# ============================================
# THE CHECKS
# ============================================

checks:
  check_1_circularity:
    question: Does asking "why?" lead back to itself?
    method: |
      "Why do you want X?"
      If answer is "Because X is what I want" → TERMINUS
      If answer is "Because it leads to Y" → Continue, trace Y
    circularity_indicators:
      - "Because that's what matters to me"
      - "Because it's [X]" (tautology)
      - "I just do"
      - "That's the point"
      - Can't articulate further reason

  check_2_would_want_anyway:
    question: Would you want this even if it led to nothing else?
    yes: Likely intrinsic → consider terminating
    no: Instrumental → keep tracing

  check_3_grounds_others:
    question: Does this goal ground other goals?
    grounds_others: Foundational → consider terminating
    derived: Not foundational → keep tracing

  check_4_necessity:
    question: Is this required for any goal pursuit?
    required: Practical necessity → terminate
    optional: Not necessary → keep tracing

  check_5_self_undermining:
    question: Is denying this self-undermining?
    self_undermining: Transcendental → terminate
    coherently_deniable: Not transcendental → keep tracing

# ============================================
# OUTCOMES
# ============================================

on_pass:
  condition: Check 1 (circularity) indicates terminus
  action: |
    Terminate the chain here.
    State: "Intrinsic goal reached: [X]. The chain terminates because
    asking 'why X?' returns to X."

    Note: There may be multiple intrinsic goals. Check if the chain
    also leads to other termini.

on_fail:
  condition: No circularity detected
  action: |
    Continue tracing. Use value elicitation:
    - "What's important to you about [current goal]?"
    - "What does [current goal] give you?"
    Apply the gate again at the next level.

# ============================================
# EXAMPLES
# ============================================

examples:
  example_1_freedom:
    chain: "Why do you want to own a business?"
    trace:
      - "To have freedom from employment constraints"
      - "What's important about freedom?"
      - "Being free is what I value"
    result: TERMINUS at Freedom
    note: For this person, freedom is intrinsic

  example_2_security:
    chain: "Why do you want to own a business?"
    trace:
      - "To have financial security"
      - "What's important about security?"
      - "Feeling secure is what matters to me"
    result: TERMINUS at Security
    note: Same action, different intrinsic goal than example 1

  example_3_multiple:
    chain: "Why do you work so hard?"
    trace_1:
      - "To achieve success"
      - "What does success give you?"
      - "Recognition and respect"
      - "What's important about recognition?"
      - "Being valued is what I want"
    trace_2:
      - "To provide for my family"
      - "What's important about providing?"
      - "Their security and wellbeing"
      - "What's important about their wellbeing?"
      - "I love them - their wellbeing IS what matters"
    result: Multiple termini - Recognition AND Love
    note: These may conflict (work more for recognition vs spend time with family)

  example_4_anti_flourishing:
    chain: "Why do you practice such strict asceticism?"
    trace:
      - "To purify myself"
      - "What's important about purification?"
      - "Spiritual purity is the highest value"
      - "What's important about spiritual purity?"
      - "It's the point of existence"
    result: TERMINUS at Spiritual purity (even at cost of comfort/pleasure)
    note: This is a valid intrinsic goal even if unconventional

  example_5_playing_to_lose:
    chain: "Why do you deliberately fail?"
    trace:
      - "Because succeeding by conventional measures feels hollow"
      - "What's important about avoiding that?"
      - "Authenticity - being true to myself"
      - "What's important about authenticity?"
      - "That IS what matters"
    result: TERMINUS at Authenticity
    note: "Playing to lose" serves authenticity for this person

# ============================================
# CAUTIONS
# ============================================

cautions:
  assuming_flourishing:
    risk: Defaulting to "flourishing" as if universal
    mitigation: |
      Use value elicitation. Don't assume.
      Different people have different intrinsic goals.
      Some have anti-flourishing goals.

  single_terminus:
    risk: Stopping at first intrinsic goal found
    mitigation: |
      Check for multiple intrinsic goals.
      Actions often serve several.
      Note potential conflicts.

  judging_intrinsic_goals:
    risk: Dismissing unusual intrinsic goals as "wrong"
    mitigation: |
      The gate tests STRUCTURE (does it terminate?), not CONTENT.
      If circularity is reached, it's a valid terminus for that person.
      Asceticism, victimhood, playing to lose are all valid.

  false_terminus:
    risk: Accepting circular language that isn't genuine circularity
    mitigation: |
      Probe further. "I just do" might be laziness, not terminus.
      Try: "What would be missing if you didn't have X?"
      If they can articulate what's missing, there's more to trace.

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO GOAL JOURNEYS
# ============================================

goal_journey_connection: |
  Every goal journey terminates at one or more intrinsic goals.

  A chain that doesn't reach intrinsic goal is INCOMPLETE.
  A chain with conflicting intrinsic goals has TENSION.
  A chain with anti-flourishing terminus is still VALID.

  Use this gate to:
  1. Check if goal chain is complete
  2. Identify ALL intrinsic goals, not just one
  3. Note conflicts between multiple termini
  4. Validate unusual intrinsic goals without judgment
