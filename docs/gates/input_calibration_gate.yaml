  Gate for deciding whether to seek more input vs act on what you have.

  The tension: More input can improve decisions, but it can also cause
  paralysis, noise, and delay. This gate helps calibrate.

when_to_use:
  - Deciding whether to gather more information
  - Evaluating whether feedback is helping or hurting
  - Determining when analysis is sufficient
  - Choosing between action and investigation

# ============================================
# CURRENT INPUT STATE
# ============================================
current_input_state:
  description: What input do you already have?

  questions:
    - "What information do you currently have about this decision/problem?"
    - "How confident are you in the key facts? (percentage or HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)"
    - "What are the key uncertainties remaining?"
    - "How much input have you already gathered?"
    - "What sources have you already consulted?"

# ============================================
# ADDITIONAL INPUT BENEFIT
# ============================================
input_benefits:
  description: Would more input actually help?

  uncertainty_reduction:
    - "Would additional input reduce uncertainty on the key question?"
    - "Is the remaining uncertainty resolvable with more input?"
    - "Or is it fundamental uncertainty that more input won't reduce?"
    - "What specific question would additional input answer?"

  decision_change_potential:
    - "Could any realistic additional input change your decision?"
    - "What would you need to learn to change course?"
    - "Is that learnable, or are you hoping for certainty that won't come?"

  error_detection:
    - "Could additional input surface errors in current understanding?"
    - "Are you in an echo chamber (similar sources confirming each other)?"
    - "What contrary perspective have you not heard?"

# ============================================
# ADDITIONAL INPUT COST
# ============================================
input_costs:
  description: What is the cost of seeking more input?

  delay:
    - "How long would gathering more input take?"
    - "What is the cost of that delay?"
    - "Is the situation time-sensitive?"
    - "Are options closing while you gather input?"

  noise:
    - "Would additional input add signal or noise?"
    - "Are you already at diminishing returns?"
    - "Is more input making the decision harder, not clearer?"

  action_displacement:
    - "Is seeking input becoming a substitute for action?"
    - "Could you learn more by acting than by researching?"
    - "Is the next action reversible if new input changes things?"

  analysis_paralysis:
    - "Are you seeking input to avoid deciding?"
    - "Have you set a deadline for decision?"
    - "What would 'enough' input look like?"

# ============================================
# INPUT SOURCE QUALITY
# ============================================
source_quality:
  description: Is the available additional input worth getting?

  questions:
    - "What sources are available that you haven't consulted?"
    - "How reliable are those sources?"
    - "Do they have information you don't have, or just opinions?"
    - "Would they tell you what you want to hear, or the truth?"
    - "Is the source appropriate for this question?"

# ============================================
# DECISION LOGIC
# ============================================
decision_logic: |
  SEEK MORE INPUT if:
  - Key uncertainties are resolvable with available input
  - Additional input could realistically change the decision
  - Cost of delay is low relative to cost of error
  - You haven't heard contrary perspectives

  ACT ON CURRENT INPUT if:
  - Remaining uncertainty is not resolvable (fundamental)
  - No realistic input would change decision
  - Delay cost exceeds error cost
  - Action is reversible and will generate better input
  - You're seeking input to avoid deciding

  SEEK SPECIFIC INPUT if:
  - There's a particular gap that's addressable
  - One more source would resolve a key question
  - Quick verification would significantly reduce risk

  SET DEADLINE if:
  - Input-seeking has no natural end point
  - Decision is being avoided
  - Diminishing returns are evident

# ============================================
# CALIBRATION HEURISTICS
# ============================================
heuristics:
  too_little_input:
    - "Haven't heard any contrary perspective"
    - "Relying on single source"
    - "Key assumptions untested"
    - "Would be surprised by basic objections"

  too_much_input:
    - "New input isn't changing understanding"
    - "Getting conflicting advice that cancels out"
    - "Feeling more confused, not clearer"
    - "Seeking input to delay decision"
    - "Perfect information isn't available and never will be"

  right_amount:
    - "Key uncertainties are identified (even if not resolved)"
    - "Decision would survive learning something unexpected"
    - "Have heard strongest contrary case"
    - "Know what would change your mind"
