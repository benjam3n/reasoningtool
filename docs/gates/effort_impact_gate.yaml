# Prioritizes actions by effort required vs impact achieved

description: |
  Classifies actions/claims by effort required and potential impact.
  Ensures LOW effort + HIGH impact actions are done FIRST.
  Prevents busy work traps (HIGH effort + LOW impact).

core_principle: |
  Many high-impact actions feel uncomfortable but are LOW effort.
  Low-impact actions often feel safe and productive.
  Override feelings with explicit analysis.

questions:
  - id: effort_assessment
    question: "How much effort to execute this action?"
    options:
      - LOW: "Quick check, single action, minimal resources"
      - MEDIUM: "Multiple steps, some coordination, days of work"
      - HIGH: "Major undertaking, significant resources, weeks/months"
    output: effort_level

  - id: impact_assessment
    question: "If successful, how much would this change the outcome?"
    options:
      - LOW: "Minor improvement, doesn't really move the needle"
      - MEDIUM: "Meaningful progress, noticeable difference"
      - HIGH: "Significant shift, could be decisive"
    output: impact_level

  - id: direct_path
    question: "Is there a DIRECT path to this outcome?"
    options:
      - DIRECT: "Can go straight to target/source"
      - INDIRECT: "Requires intermediaries, reputation building, waiting"
    output: path_type

  - id: discomfort_check
    question: "Does this action feel uncomfortable despite being low effort?"
    note: "Discomfort often indicates high-impact actions we're avoiding"
    output: discomfort_flag

outputs:
  - name: priority_classification
    type: enum
    values:
      - DO_FIRST: "LOW effort + HIGH impact - obvious win"
      - DO_SECOND: "HIGH effort + HIGH impact - worth investment"
      - MAYBE: "LOW effort + LOW impact - if nothing better"
      - AVOID: "HIGH effort + LOW impact - busy work trap"

  - name: action_order
    type: list
    description: "Ordered list with DO_FIRST items first"

decision_logic: |
  IF effort == LOW AND impact == HIGH:
    → DO_FIRST (priority 1)
    NOTE: If this feels uncomfortable, that's a signal it's important

  IF effort == HIGH AND impact == HIGH:
    → DO_SECOND (priority 2)
    NOTE: Worth the investment, but do obvious wins first

  IF effort == LOW AND impact == LOW:
    → MAYBE (priority 3)
    NOTE: Only if no better options available

  IF effort == HIGH AND impact == LOW:
    → AVOID (priority 4)
    NOTE: Busy work trap - feels productive but isn't

  BONUS: If path_type == DIRECT, increase priority
  BONUS: If discomfort_flag == true AND effort == LOW, strongly consider DO_FIRST

common_traps:
  - trap: "Start a blog / create content"
    reality: "HIGH effort, INDIRECT, uncertain impact"
    alternative: "Direct outreach to decision makers"

  - trap: "Build comprehensive system first"
    reality: "HIGH effort before validation"
    alternative: "Test core assumption with minimal prototype"

  - trap: "Research more before acting"
    reality: "Often avoidance of uncomfortable action"
    alternative: "Take smallest possible action, learn from feedback"

  - trap: "Perfect the message"
    reality: "Diminishing returns on polish"
    alternative: "Send good-enough message now, iterate if needed"

verification: |
  Before classifying:
  1. Is the effort estimate honest? (not inflated to avoid discomfort)
  2. Is the impact estimate honest? (not deflated to justify avoidance)
  3. Is there a more direct path we're ignoring?
  4. Are we avoiding this because it's hard or because it's uncomfortable?
