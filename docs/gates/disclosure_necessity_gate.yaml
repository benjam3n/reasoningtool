  Gate for deciding when disclosure/transparency is necessary vs unnecessary.

  The tension: More disclosure isn't always better. Sometimes it helps,
  sometimes it hurts. This gate helps determine which applies.

when_to_use:
  - Deciding what to share with stakeholders
  - Evaluating transparency requests
  - Designing communication strategies
  - Setting information policies

# ============================================
# DISCLOSURE EXISTENCE CHECK
# ============================================
disclosure_existence:
  description: Is there something to disclose?

  questions:
    - "Is there information that could be disclosed?"
    - "Is there a specific disclosure being considered or requested?"
    - "Who is requesting or would receive the disclosure?"
    - "What is the nature of what would be disclosed?"
      # Types: facts, plans, uncertainties, mistakes, constraints, motivations

# ============================================
# DISCLOSURE BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
# ============================================
disclosure_benefits:
  description: What value does disclosure provide?

  trust_building:
    - "Does the recipient need this information to trust us?"
    - "Would withholding erode trust if discovered later?"
    - "Is there a pattern of withheld information that damages credibility?"
    - "Would disclosure demonstrate alignment of interests?"

  decision_quality:
    - "Does the recipient need this information to make good decisions?"
    - "Would incomplete information lead to suboptimal choices?"
    - "Is the recipient acting on assumptions that are wrong?"
    - "Would disclosure enable better coordination?"

  accountability:
    - "Is disclosure required for legitimate oversight?"
    - "Is someone entitled to this information (legal, contractual, ethical)?"
    - "Does accountability serve a valid purpose here?"
    - "Would opacity enable bad behavior (by us or others)?"

  error_correction:
    - "Could disclosure surface errors we don't know about?"
    - "Does the recipient have information that could correct our understanding?"
    - "Is there feedback we're not getting due to opacity?"

# ============================================
# DISCLOSURE COST ASSESSMENT
# ============================================
disclosure_costs:
  description: What harm could disclosure cause?

  exploitation_risk:
    - "Could this information be used against us?"
    - "Who specifically would benefit from exploiting this?"
    - "What is the realistic probability of exploitation?"
    - "What would be the magnitude of harm from exploitation?"

  premature_action:
    - "Is the information incomplete or preliminary?"
    - "Could disclosure trigger premature reactions?"
    - "Would disclosure lock in positions before understanding is complete?"
    - "Is the situation still evolving?"

  cognitive_overload:
    - "Does the recipient need this information?"
    - "Would disclosure add noise rather than signal?"
    - "Is the recipient equipped to process this information?"
    - "Would disclosure distract from more important matters?"

  relationship_damage:
    - "Could disclosure harm necessary relationships?"
    - "Is there sensitive information about third parties?"
    - "Would disclosure violate confidentiality obligations?"
    - "Could disclosure create conflict that serves no purpose?"

# ============================================
# DISCLOSURE TIMING
# ============================================
disclosure_timing:
  description: Is now the right time?

  questions:
    - "Is there urgency to disclose now vs later?"
    - "Would delay increase or decrease the costs?"
    - "Would delay increase or decrease the benefits?"
    - "Is there a natural moment for disclosure?"
    - "Are we waiting because it's genuinely better to wait, or avoiding discomfort?"

# ============================================
# DECISION LOGIC
# ============================================
decision_logic: |
  DISCLOSE if:
  - Recipient needs it for decisions they must make
  - Withholding would damage trust if discovered
  - Accountability requires it (legitimate oversight)
  - Benefits clearly outweigh costs

  WITHHOLD if:
  - High exploitation risk with low benefit
  - Information is premature/incomplete
  - Recipient doesn't need it (noise not signal)
  - Legitimate confidentiality obligations

  PARTIAL DISCLOSURE if:
  - Some aspects are needed, others are not
  - Summary is sufficient, details are not needed
  - Timing is right for some, not all

  DELAY if:
  - Information is still forming
  - Better moment is imminent
  - Current timing would cause harm that waiting would avoid
