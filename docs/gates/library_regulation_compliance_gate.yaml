    name: Library Regulation Compliance Check
    description: |
      Enforces drafting regulations for regulated library artifacts (like standardized forms).
      This gate runs before any planning/execution to ensure the engine is not operating on
      ambiguous, bundled, or conditionally-scaffolded prompts.

      Rules and scopes are defined under:
      - library/regulations/enforcement.yaml
      - library/regulations/quality_rules.yaml
      - library/FORM_DRAFTING_STANDARD.md
