  Making abstract "withhold" principles concrete.
  These are SPECIFIC categories with SPECIFIC reasoning.

  Rule: If unsure whether something falls into these categories,
  default to not sharing. Add to this list when new categories emerge.

# ============================================
# ABSOLUTE NEVER SHARE
# ============================================
absolute_never_share:

  - category: "Your Walkaway Point"
    what: "The actual point at which you would stop, refuse, or give up"
    why: "Knowing your floor lets them offer exactly that, no more"
    examples:
      - "The lowest price you'd accept"
      - "The deadline after which you'd quit"
      - "The conditions under which you'd give up this goal"
      - "Your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)"
    concrete_rule: "Never state your actual minimum. If asked, redirect or give a range that includes your minimum but goes higher."

  - category: "Your Response Plans"
    what: "What you will do if they take specific actions"
    why: "Knowing your responses lets them game them or avoid triggers"
    examples:
      - "If they say no, I will do X"
      - "If they delay, I will escalate to Y"
      - "My contingency plan if this fails"
      - "The sequence of my next moves"
    concrete_rule: "Never reveal conditional plans. Keep responses unpredictable from their view."

  - category: "Your Actual Constraints"
    what: "The real limits on your time, money, options, flexibility"
    why: "Knowing your constraints lets them use them against you"
    examples:
      - "I only have until Friday" (real deadline)
      - "This is my only option" (no alternatives)
      - "I can't afford to lose this" (desperation)
      - "I don't have budget for more" (real limit)
    concrete_rule: "Never reveal real constraints unless necessary AND you've verified they can't be exploited."

  - category: "Your Uncertainty"
    what: "What you don't know, where you're guessing, your confidence levels"
    why: "Knowing your uncertainty lets them fill gaps with their preferred narrative"
    examples:
      - "I'm not sure if this is right"
      - "I haven't verified this"
      - "I don't know what they'll do"
      - "This might not work"
    concrete_rule: "Express uncertainty internally but present conclusions externally. Never say 'I don't know' - say 'I'll look into that' or make a decision."

  - category: "Your Motivation Sources"
    what: "The deeper reasons why you want something"
    why: "Knowing your motivation lets them manipulate it or offer substitutes"
    examples:
      - "I need this because of X personal situation"
      - "This matters to me because of Y emotional reason"
      - "I'm doing this for Z person"
      - "My real goal is A, this is just a step toward it"
    concrete_rule: "Share goals, not motivations. Share what you want to happen, not why you want it."

  - category: "Your Internal Disagreements"
    what: "Conflicts, debates, or dissent within your side"
    why: "Knowing internal cracks lets them exploit them or wait for you to fracture"
    examples:
      - "Some of us think X, others think Y"
      - "I'm not fully aligned with my team on this"
      - "We had a debate about whether to..."
      - "I disagree with my organization's position"
    concrete_rule: "Present unified front externally. Resolve disagreements internally before communication."

  - category: "Your Information Sources"
    what: "How you know what you know, who told you, what you've accessed"
    why: "Knowing your sources lets them cut them off, poison them, or assess your knowledge limits"
    examples:
      - "I heard from X that..."
      - "I saw in document Y that..."
      - "My source inside Z said..."
      - "I've been monitoring W"
    concrete_rule: "State conclusions without sources unless source adds credibility AND can't be compromised."

  - category: "Your Evaluation Criteria"
    what: "How you're deciding what's good/bad, what you're optimizing for"
    why: "Knowing your criteria lets them game metrics or offer hollow wins"
    examples:
      - "We're measuring success by X"
      - "What I care most about is Y"
      - "I'll be evaluating based on Z"
      - "The most important factor is A"
    concrete_rule: "Don't reveal weights. Accept results based on outcomes, not on them matching your stated criteria."

# ============================================
# SITUATIONAL NEVER SHARE
# ============================================
situational_never_share:

  - category: "Future Actions (Specific)"
    what: "Exactly what you will do and when"
    when_applicable: "When telling them gives them opportunity to counter or prepare"
    examples:
      - "We're planning to announce X on Tuesday"
      - "I'm going to apply to company Y next month"
      - "We'll be launching Z before they do"
    exception: "Share if coordination is required and they can't counter"

  - category: "Your Assessment of Them"
    what: "What you think about their strengths, weaknesses, intentions"
    when_applicable: "When they could adjust behavior or become defensive"
    examples:
      - "I think you're bluffing"
      - "Your weakness is X"
      - "I believe you actually want Y"
    exception: "Share if confrontation is the strategy"

  - category: "Third Party Information"
    what: "What others have told you about them or the situation"
    when_applicable: "When it could compromise the third party or poison relationships"
    examples:
      - "Person A said you did X"
      - "I heard from B that you're planning Y"
    exception: "Share if third party is irrelevant and info is publicly verifiable"

# ============================================
# HOW TO USE THIS LIST
# ============================================
usage:
  before_communication: |
    1. List all information you're considering sharing
    2. Check each against absolute_never_share categories
    3. Check situational_never_share with context
    4. For anything matching: REMOVE from communication
    5. Review remaining content for implicit reveals

  when_asked_directly: |
    Strategies for when they ask for never-share information:

    1. Redirect: "That's not the key question. The key question is..."
    2. Reverse: "Why do you ask?" (understand their goal)
    3. Range: Give a range that includes but doesn't reveal your point
    4. Defer: "I'll need to think about that" (buy time)
    5. Decline: "I'm not able to discuss that" (if power allows)

  periodic_review: |
    Add to this list when:
    - You reveal something and it gets used against you
    - You notice a new pattern of exploitation
    - A trusted source identifies a new vulnerability category
