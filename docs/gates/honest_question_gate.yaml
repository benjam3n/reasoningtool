# Honest Question Gate
# Checks if a question has an identifiable goal before engaging with it

id: honest_question_gate
name: Honest Question Gate
version: "1.0.0"
domain: core

description: |
  A question is "honest" (in the special sense) when its goal is identifiable.
  This gate checks whether a question's goal can be identified before engaging.

  Questions with identifiable goals are evaluable.
  Questions with hidden/unclear goals cannot be properly evaluated.

purpose: |
  Filter out questions that cannot be meaningfully engaged with because
  their purpose is unclear. This prevents wasted effort on questions
  that may be:
  - Rhetorical (not seeking an answer)
  - Confused (asker doesn't know what they want)
  - Deceptive (hiding true intent)
  - Noise (not really a question)

# ============================================
# THE GATE
# ============================================

question: Can the goal of this question be identified?

evaluation_criteria:
  - The question's purpose can be stated explicitly
  - The type of answer that would satisfy the question is clear
  - The reason for asking is identifiable
  - What the asker would do with the answer is understandable

# ============================================
# CHECKS
# ============================================

checks:
  check_1_purpose:
    question: What is this question trying to achieve?
    pass_condition: A specific purpose can be articulated
    fail_condition: No clear purpose; vague "just wondering"
    example_pass: "I want to know X so I can decide Y"
    example_fail: "I don't know, I'm just asking"

  check_2_satisfaction:
    question: What kind of answer would satisfy this question?
    pass_condition: The form of a satisfying answer is clear
    fail_condition: Any answer could be rejected; goalposts movable
    example_pass: "An answer that explains the mechanism"
    example_fail: "I'll know it when I see it" (with no criteria)

  check_3_reason:
    question: Why is this question being asked now?
    pass_condition: A reason can be given for the timing/context
    fail_condition: No apparent reason; arbitrary
    example_pass: "I need to make a decision by Friday"
    example_fail: "No reason, just curious" (when stakes are high)

  check_4_use:
    question: What will the asker do with the answer?
    pass_condition: A concrete use is identifiable
    fail_condition: Answer would just... exist; no use
    example_pass: "I'll use it to update my plan"
    example_fail: "Nothing, I just want to know"

# ============================================
# OUTCOMES
# ============================================

on_pass:
  action: Engage with the question
  notes: |
    The question has an identifiable goal. Can now:
    - Evaluate if the question is necessary for the goal
    - Evaluate if this is the right question for the goal
    - Evaluate if the answer actually serves the goal

on_fail:
  action: Request clarification before engaging
  response: |
    Before I can engage with this question, I need to understand:
    - What are you trying to achieve by asking this?
    - What kind of answer would satisfy you?
    - What will you do with the answer?

    Without this, I can't tell if any answer would actually help.

on_partial:
  action: Note uncertainty and engage cautiously
  notes: |
    Goal is partially identifiable. Engage, but check back:
    - Is this answer serving the goal?
    - Should we clarify the goal further?

# ============================================
# SPECIAL CASES
# ============================================

special_cases:
  exploratory_questions:
    description: Questions asked to learn, not to solve specific problem
    handling: |
      "What is X?" can be honest even without specific use.
      The goal is: expand understanding.
      This is identifiable. Pass.

  rhetorical_questions:
    description: Questions not seeking answers
    handling: |
      Rhetorical questions have a goal (emphasize a point), but
      engaging as if they're real questions wastes effort.
      Recognize and respond to the actual point being made.

  loaded_questions:
    description: Questions with hidden assumptions
    handling: |
      "Have you stopped beating your wife?" has a hidden goal.
      Identify the assumption. Address the assumption.
      Don't accept the frame of the question.

  socratic_questions:
    description: Questions designed to lead to discovery
    handling: |
      Goal is: help the person discover something.
      This is identifiable. Engage with the discovery process.

# ============================================
# CONNECTION TO N+1
# ============================================

n_plus_1_connection: |
  The n+1 regress often manifests as endless "but why?" questions.

  Applying this gate:
  - "What is the goal of asking 'why?' again?"
  - If goal is: test the claim → engage until claim survives or fails
  - If goal is: achieve certainty → note that certainty is unachievable
  - If goal is: just keep asking → no legitimate goal, don't engage

  The gate filters illegitimate continuation of regress.

# ============================================
# EXAMPLES
# ============================================

examples:
  example_1:
    question: "How do I improve my code's performance?"
    check_1: Goal is to have faster code. Clear.
    check_2: Answer showing specific optimizations would satisfy.
    check_3: Currently code is too slow for requirements.
    check_4: Will implement the optimizations.
    result: PASS

  example_2:
    question: "But how do you REALLY know?"
    check_1: Goal unclear. Test the claim? Achieve certainty? Be difficult?
    check_2: What would satisfy? Probably nothing - will just ask again.
    check_3: Why now? Not clear.
    check_4: Unknown.
    result: FAIL - request clarification

  example_3:
    question: "What is consciousness?"
    check_1: Goal is to understand a phenomenon. Clear.
    check_2: A satisfying explanation would describe what it is.
    check_3: Intellectual curiosity (legitimate).
    check_4: Update mental model of the world.
    result: PASS (even though question is hard)
