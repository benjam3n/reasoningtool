## Example 1: "AI will replace programmers"

**Input type**: Prediction/claim

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "replace" | replace, augment, neither, partial, temporary |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Technology affecting labor roles |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any tech → any role → any change |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Programmers affect AI development |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it true? | Happening partially, not fully |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Programmer scarcity drives AI investment |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Already happening / will happen / never / cyclical |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | Some programmers → all knowledge workers |
| 9 | Modality Shift | Certainty level | Will → might → could |
| 10 | Perspective Rotation | Other views | Company sees cost savings; workers see threat |
| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | Individual job loss vs industry transformation |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Threat → Evolution of programming |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Instance-to-Category**: "Technology affecting labor roles"

### Derivation from Universal
Historical instances of technology affecting labor:
- Printing press → scribes (changed role, didn't eliminate)
- Assembly line → craftsmen (fragmented role)
- Computers → calculators (eliminated mechanical role)
- Internet → travel agents (reduced but didn't eliminate)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Historical pattern: Technologies FRAGMENT roles rather than eliminate them entirely. "Programmer" will likely split into AI-orchestrator, AI-trainer, edge-case-handler, etc.

**[T:result]** Universalization revealed fragmentation pattern not obvious from direct analysis.

## Example 2: "I want to be happy"

**Input type**: Goal/desire

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "happy" | Happy, unhappy, neutral, fluctuating, transcendent |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Pursuit of emotional state |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any person → any emotion → any desire |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Happiness seeks me; others want me happy |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it real? | Is "happiness" a coherent goal? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Happiness causes wanting (hedonic treadmill) |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Was happy, will be, sometimes, never |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | My happiness → family's → community's |
| 9 | Modality Shift | Certainty level | Want → need → deserve |
| 10 | Perspective Rotation | Other views | Buddhist: attachment causes suffering |
| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | Moment, day, life, legacy |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Pursue happiness → accept all states |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Existence Check** + **Instance-to-Category**: "Pursuit of emotional state"

### Derivation from Universal
What do people actually pursue when they say "happiness"?
- Pleasure (hedonic)
- Meaning (eudaimonic)
- Flow (engagement)
- Connection (relational)
- Peace (equanimity)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** "Happiness" bundles 5+ distinct pursuits. Clarifying WHICH pursuit matters more than generic "be happy."

**[T:result]** Existence check revealed ambiguity; derivation revealed multiple distinct goals.

## Example 3: "The code is slow"

**Input type**: Observation/problem

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "slow" | Slow, fast, adequate, variable, depends-on-load |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Performance problem |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Which code, what metric, compared to what |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | User is slow; perception is slow |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it true? | Measured or perceived? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Slow code caused current architecture choices |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Always slow, recently became slow, will become slow |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | This function, this service, whole system |
| 9 | Modality Shift | Certainty level | Is slow → seems slow → could be slow |
| 10 | Perspective Rotation | Other views | User: frustrated; Dev: technical debt; Business: cost |
| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | Single request, peak load, 10x growth |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Slow = thorough; opportunity for optimization |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Existence Check**: Is it actually slow (measured)?

### Derivation from Universal
What could "slow" actually mean?
- Slow response time (latency)
- Slow throughput (volume)
- Slow under load (scalability)
- Slow compared to expectations (perception)
- Slow compared to competitors (relative)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Many "slow" complaints are perception problems, not performance problems. First step: measure to verify problem exists.

**[T:result]** Existence check prevented premature optimization.

## Example 4: "How do I ship this feature on time?"

**Input type**: Problem seeking solution

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "ship" | Ship fully, partially, late, not at all |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Resource-time tradeoff problem |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any deliverable, any deadline, any team |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Feature ships team; customer ships feature |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is deadline real? | Externally imposed or self-imposed? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Deadline causes scope; scope caused deadline |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Deadline flexible? Already passed? |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | This feature → MVP → core value |
| 9 | Modality Shift | Certainty level | Must ship → should ship → want to ship |
| 10 | Perspective Rotation | Other views | Customer wants value, not feature |
| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | One feature, release, roadmap, strategy |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Constraint → forcing function for prioritization |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Instance-to-Category**: "Resource-time tradeoff problem"

### Derivation from Universal
What solutions work for resource-time tradeoffs?
- Add resources (hire, overtime)
- Reduce scope (MVP, cut features)
- Extend time (push deadline)
- Increase efficiency (remove blockers)
- Change success criteria (partial delivery OK)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Question assumes scope is fixed. Universalization reveals: renegotiate scope to fit time rather than time to fit scope.

**[T:result]** Derivation from problem class revealed scope negotiation as primary lever.

| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | MoM, YoY, since founding |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Flat growth = consolidation phase |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Boundary Dissolution** + **Existence Check**: What are we actually measuring?

### Derivation from Universal
What could "growth" mean for a startup?
- Revenue growth (dollars)
- User growth (count)
- Engagement growth (activity)
- Retention improvement (less churn)
- Unit economics improvement (efficiency)
- Learning rate (validated learnings)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** "Not growing" often means measuring wrong thing. Learning and retention improvements may matter more than user acquisition at certain stages.

**[T:result]** Boundary dissolution revealed multiple growth metrics; correct one depends on stage.

| 1 | State Space | States of "take" | Take, decline, negotiate, defer |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Career decision under uncertainty |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any job, any offer, any person |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Company deciding about me |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is this real choice? | Other options actually available? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Taking job causes career path vs career path led to offer |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Accept now, later, never |

### Derivation from Universal
Career decisions at different scales:
- 1-year: Skills, compensation, learning
- 5-year: Trajectory, network, optionality
- Career: Identity, fulfillment, legacy

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Most job decisions over-weight short-term (comp) and under-weight medium-term (trajectory). Ask: "What does this make possible in 5 years?"

**[T:result]** Scale variation revealed time-horizon bias in typical analysis.

**Input type**: Diagnostic question

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "suffering" | Suffering, improving, stable, undefined |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Quality degradation in output |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | What writing, what quality, who judges |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Quality judging the writer |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it suffering? | Measured or assumed? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | "Good" writing causes quality expectations |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Always was, recently became, will recover |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | This piece, all pieces, industry-wide |

### Derivation from Universal
Quality by different perspectives:
- Reader: Clarity, usefulness, engagement
- Writer: Expression, craft, satisfaction
- Editor: Correctness, consistency, style
- Algorithm: Engagement metrics, SEO

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** "Quality suffering" may mean different things to different stakeholders. AI writing scores high on algorithm metrics but low on reader depth perception.

**[T:result]** Perspective rotation revealed stakeholder-specific quality definitions.

| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Problem → symptom of something else |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Negation Reframe**: Communication problem as SYMPTOM, not root cause

### Derivation from Universal
What causes "communication problems"?
- Trust deficit (don't share)
- Incentive misalignment (don't want to share)
- Structural barriers (can't share)
- Skill gaps (don't know how)
- Information overload (too much sharing)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** "Communication problem" is almost never the root cause. Usually symptom of trust, incentives, or structure. Fixing communication doesn't fix underlying issue.

**[T:result]** Negation reframe revealed communication as symptom, not cause.

## Example 9: "I procrastinate too much"

**Input type**: Personal problem

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "procrastinate" | Too much, right amount, too little |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Behavioral pattern mismatch with goals |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Anyone, any behavior, any task |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Tasks procrastinate on me (wait for me) |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it procrastination? | Or prioritization? |

| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Procrastination → information about what matters |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Causal Reversal** + **Negation Reframe**: Procrastination as SIGNAL, not problem

### Derivation from Universal
What does procrastination signal?
- Task is wrong (shouldn't do it)
- Approach is wrong (need different method)
- Timing is wrong (not ready yet)
- Environment is wrong (need different context)
- Energy is wrong (need rest first)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Procrastination is often adaptive. Rather than "fix" it, ask what it's signaling about the task or approach.

**[T:result]** Causal reversal + negation reframe revealed procrastination as information.

## Example 10: "How do I become more creative?"

**Input type**: Self-improvement goal

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "creative" | More, less, different kind, latent |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Capability development goal |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any person, any capability, any development |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Creativity becomes me |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it a skill to develop? | Or environment to create? |
| 6 | Causal Reversal | Flip causation | Creative output causes creative identity |
| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Was creative, will be, sometimes am |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | My creativity, team's, org's |

| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Lack of creativity → excess of judgment |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Negation Reframe**: "Not creative enough" → "Too much judgment"

### Derivation from Universal
What blocks creativity?
- Too much judgment (kill ideas too early)
- Too little input (nothing to recombine)
- Too much pressure (stakes too high)
- Too little constraint (no forcing function)
- Wrong framing (asking wrong question)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Creativity is usually present but suppressed by judgment. "Become more creative" often means "judge less early in process."

**[T:result]** Negation reframe revealed judgment as blocker, not creativity as missing.

## Example 11: "Our product needs more features"

**Input type**: Product decision

### Technique Application

| # | Technique | Application | Output |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | State Space | States of "more" | More, fewer, different, same |
| 2 | Instance-to-Category | Category | Product scope decision |
| 3 | Parameter Variation | Vary components | Any product, any features, any need |
| 4 | Role Reversal | Swap roles | Features need product; users need something |
| 5 | Existence Check | Is it true? | Evidence that features drive desired outcome? |

| 7 | Temporal Variation | Vary timing | Needed now, needed later, always needed |
| 8 | Boundary Dissolution | Change scope | This feature, feature category, product strategy |
| 9 | Modality Shift | Certainty level | Needs → wants → could use |
| 10 | Perspective Rotation | Other views | User, buyer, support, engineering |
| 11 | Scale Variation | Different scales | Power user, average user, new user |
| 12 | Negation Reframe | Flip valence | Missing features → feature discovery problem |

### Best Universalization Selected
**Causal Reversal**: Feature requests as symptom of something else

### Derivation from Universal
What causes "need more features" requests?
- Core value not delivered (compensating)
- Features not discovered (exist but unknown)
- Wrong users (features for different segment)
- Competitor comparison (matching, not needed)
- Future-proofing anxiety (preparing for unknown)

### Insight Derived
**[UNEXPECTED]** Feature requests often mean core value isn't landing. Before adding features, verify users are getting value from existing features.

**[T:result]** Causal reversal revealed feature requests as symptom of core value delivery failure.
