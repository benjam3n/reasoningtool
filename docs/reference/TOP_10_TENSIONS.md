## Before Analyzing Any Tension: 5 Universal Discriminators

Apply these questions FIRST to any trade-off:

| # | Question | If HIGH | If LOW |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **VOI**: Would resolving this change what I do? | Engage deeply | Note and move on |
| 2 | **Reversibility**: Can I recover if wrong? | Commit faster | Be more careful |
| 3 | **Stakes**: What's the consequence of error? | More analysis | Quick decision |
| 4 | **Time Pressure**: How urgent? | Act now | Can deliberate |
| 5 | **Information State**: What do I know vs need? | Research first | Decide now |

## The Top 10

### 1. Analysis vs Action (U1)

**The tension**: Think more vs act sooner
**Master question**: "After 10 more minutes of analysis, will I learn something that changes my action?"

**When Analysis wins**: Irreversible decision, high stakes, information is obtainable
**When Action wins**: Reversible, low stakes, learning requires doing
**Test**: Will more thinking change what I do? If no, act.

---

### 2. Stated vs Underlying (#50) - FOUNDATIONAL

**The tension**: Surface request vs real need
**Master question**: "Is this what they asked for or what they actually need?"

**When Stated wins**: Request is clear and considered, trust the speaker
**When Underlying wins**: Request seems symptomatic, speaker may not know their need
**Test**: If I deliver exactly what's asked, will they be satisfied?

*This is foundational - resolve it before other tensions.*

---

### 3. Quality vs Quantity (U3)

**The tension**: Fewer better things vs more adequate things
**Master question**: "Would one 10x quality unit beat ten 1x units?"

**When Quality wins**: Winner-take-all dynamics, reputation matters, errors compound
**When Quantity wins**: Portfolio benefits, learning from volume, coverage matters
**Test**: Does doubling quality matter more than doubling quantity?

---

### 4. General vs Specialized (U2)

**The tension**: One solution for everything vs specific solutions
**Master question**: "Apply general to different contexts - works well, adequately, or fails?"

**When General wins**: Core structure applies everywhere, details vary
**When Specialized wins**: Contexts are fundamentally different, general is mediocre everywhere
**Test**: Does the "universal" approach fail in any context?

---

### 5. Current vs Future Value (U8)

**The tension**: Optimize for now vs optimize for later
**Master question**: "What's the cost of redesign vs cost of failure at scale?"

**When Current wins**: Future is uncertain, need to survive now, can iterate
**When Future wins**: Path dependency is strong, redesign is expensive, patterns will be copied
**Test**: If this grows 10x, will I regret the current approach?

---

### 6. Exploration vs Validation (U9)

**The tension**: Try new things vs verify what you have
**Master question**: "Sessions since last validation - if >5, validate"

**When Exploration wins**: Early stage, haven't found what works, cheap to try
**When Validation wins**: Have something promising, need to know if it's real
**Test**: Do I need more options or more certainty about existing options?

---

### 7. Simple vs Complex Solutions (#10)

**The tension**: Elegant simplicity vs comprehensive completeness
**Master question**: "At what level of aggregation to optimize?"

**When Simple wins**: Problem is well-understood, edge cases are rare, maintenance matters
**When Complex wins**: Edge cases are common, completeness required, simple fails
**Test**: What percentage of cases does the simple solution handle? If >90%, stay simple.

---

### 8. Internal vs External Validation (#75)

**The tension**: Self-evaluation vs outside perspective
**Master question**: "What's the gap between what we know and need to know?"

**When Internal wins**: Fast feedback needed, expertise is internal, external is expensive
**When External wins**: Blind spots likely, stakes are high, objectivity required
**Test**: Could I be fooling myself? If possibly yes, get external.

---

### 9. Synergy vs Complexity (#1)

**The tension**: Combine for integration benefits vs separate for simplicity
**Master question**: "Does combining create value or just coupling?"

**When Synergy wins**: Components enhance each other, shared context matters
**When Separation wins**: Components are independent, coupling creates fragility
**Test**: If I change one part, how many other parts break?

---

### 10. Comfortable vs Valuable (#40)

**The tension**: Do what's easy vs do what matters
**Master question**: "If I could only do one thing, which would I regret not doing?"

**When Comfortable wins**: You're depleted, sustainable pace matters, easy ≠ unimportant
**When Valuable wins**: You're avoiding important things, comfort is procrastination
**Test**: Am I choosing this because it's easy or because it's right?

## Four Foundational Tensions (Resolve First)

These have DEPENDENCY relationships - other tensions depend on resolving these:

| # | Tension | Why Foundational |
|---|---------|------------------|
| **50** | Stated vs Underlying | Can't proceed until you know the real problem |
| **56** | Specific vs General Fear | Can't choose protection until you know threat |
| **58** | Scarcity vs Abundance | Can't choose sharing until you know value model |
| **15** | Universal vs Specific | Can't choose scale until you know this |

**When facing multiple tensions, resolve these four FIRST.**
