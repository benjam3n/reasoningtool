# Rules

## 1. Posts must relate to structured reasoning

Everything posted here should connect to structured reasoning methods, tools, or principles. This includes the reasoningtool specifically, but also other approaches to the same problem — comparisons, alternatives, and critiques are welcome.

Not in scope: general AI news, prompt engineering tips unrelated to reasoning structure, or "check out my chatbot."

## 2. Claims need grounding

If you make a factual claim, say where it comes from. Link to a source, cite a session, or explain your reasoning. "I think X" is fine as long as you say *why* you think X. Unsupported assertions without reasoning don't contribute to a reasoning-focused community.

## 3. Challenges are welcome, bad faith is not

Disagreement is valuable. If you think a premise is wrong, say so and explain why. If you think the toolkit fails at something, show the failure. This is how the ideas improve.

What's not welcome: dismissing without engagement ("this is just prompt engineering"), personal attacks, or trolling. Disagree with the argument, not the person.

## 4. Show your work

When sharing sessions, skills, or analysis: include enough context for someone else to understand what you did, follow the reasoning, and evaluate whether it worked. "I ran ARAW and it was great" is less useful than the actual session output with your commentary on what surprised you.

## 5. No spam or self-promotion

Sharing your own projects is fine if they relate to structured reasoning and you're participating in the community, not just dropping links. If your only posts are links to your own stuff, that's spam.

## 6. Use flairs

Tag your posts with the appropriate flair. It helps people find what they're looking for.
