# First Posts Plan

Launch with 5-7 posts over the first few days. These establish what good content looks like and give subscribers something to read and respond to.

---

## Post 1: Intro post (pinned)
**Flair**: Announcement
**Content**: The intro post (see intro_post.md)

---

## Post 2: Worked session — ARAW on a real question
**Flair**: Session
**Title**: "ARAW session: Should I open-source this project?"

Share the actual ARAW session that was run to evaluate making reasoning-toolkit public. This is a real session with a real outcome — it demonstrates the method by showing it applied to itself. Include commentary on what each phase surfaced and what would have been missed without the alternation.

Why this is a good first post: it's meta (the tool analyzing whether to release the tool), it's honest (includes the limitations discovered), and it shows the actual output format so people know what to expect.

---

## Post 3: Comparison — reasoning-toolkit vs. other approaches
**Flair**: Comparison
**Title**: "How reasoning-toolkit compares to chain-of-thought, AI agents, and prompt libraries"

Expand the comparison table from the intro into a full post. For each category (chain-of-thought, AI agents, prompt libraries, debate frameworks, knowledge management), explain: what it does well, what it can't do, and where reasoning-toolkit fills the gap. Be honest about where the alternatives are better — chain-of-thought is faster for simple questions, agents are better for execution-heavy tasks.

Why this is a good first post: it answers the first question every visitor has ("why should I use this instead of X?") and sets a tone of honest comparison rather than marketing.

---

## Post 4: The visualization tool
**Flair**: Tool
**Title**: "Interactive ARAW visualization: see your reasoning as a graph"

Walk through the visualization tool with screenshots or a screen recording. Show: launching the server, navigating the graph, filtering by branch type and depth, clicking nodes for details, using the domain filter, exporting. Include a sample database so people can try it themselves.

Why this is a good first post: it's visual (good for Reddit engagement), it shows a unique capability, and it gives people something concrete to try.

---

## Post 5: The universal/heuristic distinction
**Flair**: Philosophy
**Title**: "Some reasoning methods always apply. Others depend on context. Here's how to tell the difference."

Adapted from the README's universal/heuristic section and the math essay. Present the distinction, give examples of each, explain the tier system, and invite discussion: do people agree with the classification? Are there skills that should be reclassified?

Why this is a good first post: it's the most philosophically interesting claim in the toolkit, it's debatable (which is good for engagement), and it directly invites responses.

---

## Post 6: "Try it yourself" challenge
**Flair**: Application
**Title**: "Pick a decision you're facing and run /araw on it. Share what you found."

Invite people to try the toolkit on a real question and post the results. Provide a simple template: what was the question, what did ARAW surface that you hadn't considered, what was the most surprising branch? This seeds the community with user-generated content.

Why this is a good first post: it invites participation, generates content, and produces real examples of the toolkit in use.

---

## Post 7: What's next for the project
**Flair**: Meta
**Title**: "Roadmap: what's planned and where help is needed"

Share what's planned for the toolkit (if anything concrete), what areas need the most work, and where community contributions would have the most impact. Be specific: "the evidence grounding engine needs more source types," "the visualization needs better mobile support," "we need more worked examples in domains outside tech."

Why this is a good first post: it turns passive readers into potential contributors by showing them exactly where they can help.

## Posting schedule

- Day 1: Post 1 (intro, pinned), Post 2 (session), Post 5 (philosophy)
- Day 2: Post 3 (comparison), Post 4 (visualization)
- Day 3: Post 6 (challenge), Post 7 (roadmap)

Spacing them out gives the sub activity over multiple days rather than a single burst.
