# Strategy Templates

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Every strategy exists within a game (competitive context). Every game has structure that determines which strategies work. These templates provide systematic ways to:
1. Characterize the game being played
2. Design strategies with clear mechanisms
3. Evaluate strategies along key dimensions
4. Match strategies to game archetypes

## Steps

### Step 1: Characterize the Game

**Game structure template:**
```
GAME CHARACTERIZATION:
Players: [who is competing/cooperating]
Objectives: [what each player wants]
Rules: [constraints, laws, norms]
Resources: [what's available to deploy]
Information: [who knows what — complete/incomplete]
Timing: [simultaneous/sequential, one-shot/repeated]
Payoffs: [zero-sum/positive-sum/negative-sum]
Barriers: [entry, exit, switching costs]
```

**Game archetype matching:**

| Archetype | Characteristics | Winning Strategies |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Winner-take-all | One winner, many losers | Speed, network effects, standards |
| Red ocean | Many competitors, similar offerings | Cost leadership or differentiation |
| Blue ocean | No competition (new market) | Value innovation, create demand |
| Repeated game | Same players, many rounds | Reciprocity, reputation, tit-for-tat |
| Coordination | All benefit from alignment | Standards, first-mover, communication |
| Chicken | Both lose from collision | Credible commitment, brinkmanship |
| Prisoner's dilemma | Individual vs collective interest | Cooperation mechanisms, punishment |
| Asymmetric | Players have different strengths | Leverage your asymmetry |
| Platform | Two-sided markets | Subsidize one side, monetize other |

### Step 2: Design Strategy Using Templates

**Strategy specification template:**
```
STRATEGY:
Name: [memorable label]
Game archetype: [from Step 1]
Mechanism: [HOW this strategy wins — the causal chain]
Key assumption: [what must be true for this to work]
Resource required: [what you need to deploy]
Timeline: [when results expected]
Risk: [what could go wrong]
Kill criterion: [when to abandon this strategy]
```

**Strategy mechanism types:**
- **Cost advantage**: Win by being cheaper (economies of scale, efficiency, location)
- **Differentiation**: Win by being different (features, brand, experience)
- **Focus**: Win by serving a niche better than generalists
- **Speed**: Win by being faster (first-mover, fast-follow, rapid iteration)
- **Network**: Win by having more connections (platforms, ecosystems)
- **Lock-in**: Win by making switching costly (standards, data, habits)
- **Asymmetric**: Win by fighting a different battle than competitors expect
- **Cooperation**: Win by aligning with others (alliances, standards, communities)

### Step 3: Evaluate Strategy

Score along key dimensions:

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Feasibility**: Can we actually execute this? | | |
| **Mechanism clarity**: Is the causal chain clear? | | |
| **Assumption validity**: Are key assumptions sound? | | |
| **Defensibility**: Can competitors copy this? | | |
| **Robustness**: Does it work if conditions change? | | |
| **Reversibility**: Can we exit if it fails? | | |
| **Alignment**: Does it fit our capabilities? | | |
| **Timing**: Is now the right time? | | |

**Red flags:**
- Mechanism isn't clear ("we'll win by being better" — HOW?)
- Assumptions aren't testable
- Strategy requires competitors to be stupid
- No kill criterion defined
- Relies on predictions about the future

### Step 4: Compare Strategies
If multiple strategies are under consideration:

| Criterion | Strategy A | Strategy B | Strategy C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Upside (best case) | | | |
| Downside (worst case) | | | |
| Probability of success | | | |
| Time to result | | | |
| Resource required | | | |
| Reversibility | | | |
| Learning value | | | |

### Step 5: Stress Test
For the top strategy:
1. What if the key assumption is WRONG?
2. What if a competitor does the SAME thing?
3. What if conditions CHANGE midway?
4. What if execution is SLOWER than expected?
5. What's the MINIMUM viable version? (Test before committing)

### Step 6: Report
```
STRATEGY ANALYSIS:
Game: [archetype] — [key characteristics]
Players: [who matters]

Recommended strategy:
Name: [label]
Mechanism: [how it wins]
Key assumption: [what must be true]
Timeline: [expected results]

Evaluation: [overall score] / 40
Strongest dimension: [which]
Weakest dimension: [which — this is where risk lives]

Kill criterion: [when to abandon]
Minimum viable test: [smallest version to validate]
```

## When to Use
- Designing new strategies
- Analyzing existing strategies
- Understanding competitive dynamics
- Comparing strategy options
- → INVOKE: /dse (strategy evaluation) for deeper evaluation
- → INVOKE: /dsd (strategy derivation) for deriving strategies from goals
- → INVOKE: /ol (competitive strategy) for adversarial contexts

## Verification
- [ ] Game characterized (not just "we have competition")
- [ ] Strategy mechanism is clear and causal
- [ ] Key assumptions stated and testable
- [ ] Strategy evaluated on multiple dimensions
- [ ] Stress-tested against assumption failure
- [ ] Kill criterion defined
