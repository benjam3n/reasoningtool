# Interview Preparation

## Overview
Comprehensive preparation system for job interviews covering research, story
development, question practice, and execution across interview types.

## Steps

### Step 1: Research the company
Develop deep understanding of the company:

1. Basic facts (required):
   - What does the company do? (mission, products, services)
   - Business model (how do they make money?)
   - Size (employees, revenue, funding if startup)
   - Recent news (last 3-6 months)
   - Key competitors

2. Deeper research (differentiating):
   - Company values and culture
   - Recent strategic moves or pivots
   - Challenges they're facing
   - Industry trends affecting them
   - Leadership background (CEO, your future manager)

3. Role-specific research:
   - Why is this role open? (growth, replacement, new initiative)
   - How does it fit in org structure?
   - What does success look like?
   - Current team composition

Sources:
- Company website (About, Careers, Blog)
- LinkedIn (company page, employees, your interviewers)
- Glassdoor (reviews, interview reports)
- News (Google News, industry publications)
- SEC filings (if public)
- Crunchbase (if startup)

### Step 2: Map required competencies
Identify what they're evaluating:

1. Extract from job description:
   - Required qualifications
   - Preferred qualifications
   - Implied competencies ("fast-paced" = adaptability)

2. Standard competencies by level:
   Individual Contributor:
   - Technical skills, problem-solving, collaboration
   - Initiative, learning ability, attention to detail

   Management:
   - Leadership, team development, delegation
   - Communication, stakeholder management, strategic thinking

   Executive:
   - Vision, influence, organizational leadership
   - Business judgment, crisis management

3. Company-specific values:
   - Map stated values to likely evaluation criteria
   - "Customer obsession" = expect customer focus questions
   - "Bias for action" = expect questions about speed/decisiveness

4. Role-specific requirements:
   - Technical skills to demonstrate
   - Domain knowledge expected
   - Stakeholder relationships to manage

### Step 3: Build your story bank
Develop STAR stories for each competency:

1. For each priority competency, prepare 1-2 stories:
   - Stories should demonstrate the competency clearly
   - Include quantified results
   - Be from relevant experience (recent, similar context)

2. Create versatile stories:
   - Best stories demonstrate multiple competencies
   - Can be adjusted for different question angles
   - Aim for 8-12 strong stories total

3. Story categories to cover:
   - Greatest accomplishment
   - Biggest failure/mistake and learning
   - Conflict with colleague
   - Disagreement with manager
   - Difficult decision
   - Time you led change
   - Time you influenced without authority
   - Challenge you overcame
   - Time you failed and recovered

4. Practice out loud:
   - Record yourself telling stories
   - Time them (2-3 minutes target)
   - Refine for clarity and impact

### Step 4: Prepare for likely questions
Anticipate and prepare for specific questions:

1. Universal questions (always prepare):
   - "Tell me about yourself" (2-minute pitch)
   - "Why are you interested in this role/company?"
   - "Why are you leaving your current job?"
   - "What's your greatest strength/weakness?"
   - "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
   - "What questions do you have for me?"

2. Behavioral questions (map to stories):
   - "Tell me about a time when..." format
   - Prepare to adapt stories to specific asks
   - Have backup stories if first doesn't fit

3. Technical questions (role-specific):
   - Review fundamentals for your field
   - Practice problem-solving out loud
   - Prepare to explain your thinking process

4. Curveball questions:
   - "What would your manager say about you?"
   - "Why shouldn't we hire you?"
   - "Explain [concept] to a 5-year-old"

5. Illegal/inappropriate questions:
   - Know what's off-limits
   - Prepare polite redirects

### Step 5: Prepare your questions
Develop thoughtful questions to ask:

1. Role and expectations:
   - "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
   - "What are the biggest challenges facing this team?"
   - "How is performance measured and feedback given?"

2. Team and culture:
   - "How would you describe the team culture?"
   - "What's your favorite thing about working here?"
   - "How do teams collaborate across functions?"

3. Growth and opportunity:
   - "What growth paths exist from this role?"
   - "How does the company support professional development?"

4. Strategic and informed:
   - Reference your research: "I read about [initiative]. How does this role connect to that?"
   - Show insight: "What's the team's approach to [industry challenge]?"

5. Questions to avoid:
   - Anything easily Googled
   - Compensation (save for offer stage or recruiter)
   - Immediate vacation requests
   - Negative Glassdoor rumors

Prepare 5-7 questions, ask 2-3 per interviewer (don't repeat)

### Step 6: Technical and role-specific prep
Prepare for specialized portions:

For technical interviews:
1. Review fundamentals in your domain
2. Practice problems similar to role requirements
3. Prepare to explain your thought process
4. Practice coding/whiteboarding if applicable
5. Review your own past projects to discuss

For case interviews:
1. Learn common frameworks (profitability, market entry)
2. Practice case structure and mental math
3. Prepare to think out loud

For presentations/work samples:
1. Understand the prompt thoroughly
2. Prepare materials in advance
3. Practice delivery with timing

For panel interviews:
1. Research each panelist
2. Prepare to address different stakeholder concerns
3. Practice directing attention appropriately

### Step 7: Execute the interview

During questions:

### Step 8: Follow up and debrief

1. Immediate (same day):
   - Send thank you email to each interviewer
   - Reference specific conversation point
   - Reiterate interest
   - Keep brief (3-4 sentences)

2. Debrief yourself:
   - What went well?
   - What could have gone better?
   - Questions you struggled with
   - Questions they asked that surprised you
   - What you learned about role/company
   - How interested are you now?

3. Update tracking:
   - Log interview in your tracker
   - Note next steps and timeline
   - Set follow-up reminder if no response

4. Continue preparation:
   - If advancing, prepare for next round
   - Address any gaps revealed in this round
   - Add new stories for questions you struggled with

5. If rejected:
   - Ask for feedback (politely, not everyone shares)
   - Identify improvement areas
   - Don't burn bridges
