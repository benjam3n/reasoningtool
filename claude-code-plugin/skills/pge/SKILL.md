# Pedagogy/Educational Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Learning science shows that orderings optimized for immediate performance often hurt long-term retention, and vice versa. These orderings optimize for durable understanding, not quick completion.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Interleaving Over Blocking
- Mix different topics/types rather than doing all of one type then all of another
- Feels harder but produces better discrimination and long-term retention
- **When**: learning to distinguish between concepts, studying for exams

### Rule 2: Spacing Over Massing
- Distribute practice over time rather than cramming
- Review material at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks...)
- **When**: any learning that needs to stick long-term

### Rule 3: Test Before Teaching
- Ask the question before providing the answer
- Even failed retrieval attempts improve subsequent learning
- **When**: introducing new material, review sessions

### Rule 4: Concrete Before Abstract
- Start with specific examples, then extract the general principle
- Multiple examples before the rule, not rule then examples
- **When**: teaching concepts, building intuition

### Rule 5: Desirable Difficulty
- Make learning slightly harder than comfortable
- Slow down presentation, remove scaffolding gradually
- Too easy = no learning. Too hard = frustration. Find the edge.
- **When**: skill development, progressive training

### Rule 6: Elaborative Interrogation
- After each concept: "Why does this work?" "How does this connect to X?"
- Forces deeper processing than passive review
- **When**: reading, studying, any intake of new material

## Application
1. Identify learning goal (recognition, recall, application, transfer?)
2. Choose ordering: higher-order goals need more interleaving and testing
3. Design practice schedule with spacing
4. Resist making it "easier" — desirable difficulty is the point

## When to Use
- Curriculum design, study planning, training programs
- Self-directed learning, skill acquisition

## Verification
- [ ] Topics interleaved (not blocked)
- [ ] Practice spaced (not massed)
- [ ] Retrieval practice included
- [ ] Difficulty level appropriate (challenging but achievable)
