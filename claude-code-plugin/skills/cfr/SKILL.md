# Conflict Resolution

## Overview
Systematic procedure for de-escalating tensions, finding common ground, and navigating difficult conversations productively

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess the situation and your readiness
Before engaging, understand what you're dealing with:

Situation assessment:
1. What is the actual conflict about? (content, relationship, identity, process?)
2. How escalated is it? (early tension vs active conflict vs heated)
3. What's the history? (first incident vs pattern)
4. Who else is affected?
5. What happens if this isn't resolved?
6. Is this the right time to address it?

Self-assessment:
1. Am I calm enough to have a productive conversation?
2. What are MY interests and needs? (not positions)
3. What might I be contributing to this situation?
4. Am I approaching this to resolve or to win?
5. What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?
6. What outcome would be truly good for everyone?

### Step 2: Understand their perspective genuinely
Before solving anything, seek to understand their view:

Perspective-taking:
1. What do they likely see as the problem?
2. What are their underlying interests and needs?
3. What pressures or constraints might they be facing?
4. How might they be feeling? (frustrated, threatened, unheard?)
5. What might they think YOUR motives are?
6. What's the most charitable interpretation of their behavior?

Gathering information:
- If you don't know, ask (not interrogate) to understand
- Listen for emotions and values, not just facts
- Look for the valid point in their position (there usually is one)

Common underlying interests:
- Respect and recognition
- Autonomy and control
- Fairness and equity
- Safety and security
- Being heard and understood

### Step 3: Find common ground and shared interests
Identify where your interests align:

Shared interests to look for:
- Both want the project/team/company to succeed
- Both want to work in a healthy environment
- Both want to be respected and heard
- Both want to find a workable solution
- Both have constraints they're working within

Common ground mapping:
1. List your key interests
2. List their likely key interests
3. Identify overlaps (shared interests)
4. Identify complementary interests (different but not conflicting)
5. Identify true conflicts (limited to fewer issues than you think)

Reframing:
- "Us vs the problem" not "me vs you"
- "How do we solve this together?"
- Frame the conversation around shared interests

### Step 4: Plan the conversation
Prepare for the difficult conversation:

Logistics:
- Private setting, not public or in passing
- Adequate time (don't rush important conversations)
- Low-stakes timing (not right before a deadline or after a setback)
- Request the conversation respectfully ("Can we talk about X?")

Opening approach:
- Start with genuine shared interest or appreciation
- State your intention (to understand and resolve, not to blame)
- Own your part if relevant
- Describe impact without attributing motive

Conversation structure:
1. Set collaborative tone (we're solving together)
2. Share your perspective (using I-statements)
3. Invite their perspective (genuinely)
4. Identify shared interests
5. Generate options together
6. Agree on path forward
7. Commit to follow-up

Phrases to use:
- "I'd like to understand your perspective on..."
- "When X happened, I felt... and I assumed... Was I reading that right?"
- "What I'm hoping for is... What are you hoping for?"
- "What would work for both of us?"

### Step 5: Have the conversation
Execute the conversation with skill and presence:

During the conversation:
1. Start with your planned opening (collaborative tone)
2. Share your perspective using I-statements
   - "I felt X when Y happened" not "You made me feel X"
   - "I noticed X and assumed Y, is that accurate?"
3. STOP and listen - genuinely seek to understand their response
4. Acknowledge their perspective (doesn't mean agreeing)
   - "It sounds like you're feeling..."
   - "I can see why that would be frustrating"
5. Look for the valid point and acknowledge it
6. Share where you see common ground
7. Brainstorm solutions together
8. Agree on specific next steps

If it gets heated:
- Slow down, lower your voice
- Acknowledge the emotion: "This is clearly important to both of us"
- Take a break if needed: "Let's pause and come back to this"
- Return to shared interests

What to avoid:
- Attacking character ("You always..." "You're being...")
- Defending before understanding
- Bringing up past issues not relevant to this conversation
- Trying to "win" the conversation

### Step 6: Reach resolution
Move from understanding to agreement:

Finding resolution:
1. Summarize shared understanding of the situation
2. Review shared interests
3. Generate multiple options (don't lock into first idea)
4. Evaluate options against shared interests
5. Choose path forward that addresses key interests of both parties
6. Be specific about who does what by when

Types of resolution:
- Agreement: Both parties commit to specific actions
- Understanding: No behavior change needed, just clarity
- Compromise: Both give something to get something
- Creative solution: New option that meets both parties' needs
- Agree to disagree: Acknowledge difference, agree how to move forward

Document the agreement:
- What specifically are we each committing to?
- What does success look like?
- When will we check in on progress?
- What will we do if the issue resurfaces?

### Step 7: Repair and prevent
After resolution, invest in the relationship:

Immediate repair:
- Thank them for the conversation
- Acknowledge what was difficult
- Reaffirm the relationship or working partnership
- Follow through on your commitments immediately

Ongoing relationship:
- Check in proactively before issues arise
- Assume good intent in future interactions
- Address small issues early (don't let them build up again)
- Give credit and appreciation when things go well

Systemic prevention:
- What structural or process changes would prevent similar conflicts?
- Are there norms the team needs to establish?
- Is there feedback that leadership needs to hear?
- What did you learn about your own patterns to watch for?


## When to Use
- Addressing ongoing tension with a colleague or team member
- Having a difficult conversation about performance or behavior
- Mediating disputes between team members
- Navigating disagreements with stakeholders or partners
- Addressing conflict in meetings before it derails progress
- Rebuilding relationships after a breakdown
- Delivering or receiving feedback that may be unwelcome
- Addressing issues early before they escalate
- Managing up when you disagree with your manager
- Resolving conflicts between personal values and work expectations

## Verification
- Assessed situation and your own readiness before engaging
- Genuinely attempted to understand their perspective first
- Identified shared interests and common ground
- Used I-statements and avoided blame language
- Listened more than talked during the conversation
- Reached specific, actionable agreement or understanding
- Planned relationship repair and prevention measures
