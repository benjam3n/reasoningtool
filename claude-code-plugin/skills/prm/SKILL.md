# Pre-Mortem Analysis

## Overview
Invented by Gary Klein. Instead of asking "What might go wrong?"
(prospective), assume "It went wrong" and ask "Why?" (retrospective).
People are better at explaining past events than predicting future ones.

This cognitive reframe makes failure modes easier to identify.

## Goal
Identify failure modes BEFORE they happen by assuming the project
failed and searching for causes. Inversion makes failure identification
easier than direct risk assessment.

## Steps

### Step 1: Describe the Plan
Summarize the plan/project being analyzed.
Include: Goal, approach, timeline, key assumptions.

**Output**: Plan summary

### Step 2: Assume Total Failure
Project forward to end of timeframe.
Assume the project has COMPLETELY FAILED.
Make it vivid: "It's [date]. The project has failed spectacularly."

**Output**: Failure scenario

### Step 3: Brainstorm Failure Causes
Working backward from the failure, list all plausible causes.
Use prompts to ensure coverage of different failure types.

Each person/perspective should generate causes independently
before sharing (reduces groupthink).

**Output**: List of failure causes

### Step 4: Assess Likelihood and Impact
For each cause, estimate:
- Likelihood (High/Medium/Low)
- Impact if it happens (High/Medium/Low)

Focus attention on High-High and High-Medium items.

**Output**: Prioritized failure causes

### Step 5: Identify Warning Signs
For each high-priority cause, ask:
"What early signs would indicate this is happening?"

Good warning signs are:
- Observable before the failure
- Specific enough to detect
- Early enough to respond

**Output**: Warning signs for each cause

### Step 6: Develop Mitigations
For each high-priority cause, develop:
- Prevention: How to stop it from happening
- Contingency: What to do if it happens anyway

Be specific about actions, owners, timing.

**Output**: Mitigation plans

### Step 7: Update the Plan
Incorporate mitigations into the original plan.
Add monitoring for warning signs.
Document contingencies.

**Output**: Updated plan with pre-mortem insights


## When to Use
- Before launching project/initiative
- Before major decision
- When planning has been optimistic
- To stress-test a plan
- To surface concerns people are hesitant to voice

## Verification
- Failure was assumed vividly and specifically
- Multiple failure categories were explored
- Causes were assessed for likelihood and impact
- Warning signs are observable and early
- Mitigations are specific and actionable
- Plan was updated with insights
