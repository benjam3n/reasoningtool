# Impossible To Achievable

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

"Impossible" usually means "I can't see how." This procedure takes goals that seem impossible, identifies exactly what makes them seem that way, challenges each impossibility claim, finds analogies where similar feats were achieved, and constructs a path from impossible to achievable through decomposition and reframing.

## Steps

### Step 1: State the "Impossible" Goal
1. What is the goal, stated precisely?
2. What makes it feel/seem impossible?
3. Who says it's impossible? (you, experts, everyone?)
4. Has anyone ever achieved this or something similar?
5. When you say "impossible" do you mean: physically impossible, practically impossible, personally impossible, or "I don't see how"?

### Step 2: Classify the Impossibility

| Type | Meaning | Approach |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Physical** | Violates laws of nature | Actually impossible. Redefine the goal. |
| **Logical** | Self-contradictory | Resolve the contradiction or redefine. |
| **Resource** | Lacks required resources | Find resources, reduce requirements, or stage. |
| **Knowledge** | Don't know how | Learn, find who does, or discover the method. |
| **Political** | Blocked by people/power | Navigate, negotiate, find allies, or reframe. |
| **Temporal** | Not enough time | Reduce scope, parallelize, or extend timeline. |
| **Psychological** | Fear, doubt, learned helplessness | Address the belief, not just the plan. |

### Step 3: Challenge Each Impossibility Claim
For each reason it seems impossible:
1. Is this actually true? What's the evidence?
2. Is it always true, or only under current conditions?
3. What would need to change for it to become possible?
4. Has anyone ever overcome this specific barrier?
5. → INVOKE: /aw [impossibility claim] — what if it's wrong?

### Step 4: Find Analogies
1. Has anyone achieved something structurally similar?
2. In other domains, how were similar barriers overcome?
3. What changed that made previously impossible things possible?
4. → INVOKE: /cda [impossible goal] for cross-domain analogies
5. Extract principles from analogies, not just stories

### Step 5: Decompose into Possible Sub-Goals
1. Break the impossible goal into components
2. Which components are individually achievable?
3. Which components are the hard ones?
4. For hard components: can they be further decomposed?
5. Continue until every sub-goal is at least plausibly achievable
6. → INVOKE: /dcm [goal] for systematic decomposition

### Step 6: Construct the Path
1. Order the sub-goals (which enables which?)
2. Identify the critical path (longest/hardest sequence)
3. For each sub-goal on critical path: what's the method?
4. Where are the remaining uncertainties?
5. Design experiments to resolve uncertainties before committing

### Step 7: Reality Check
1. Is the decomposed version actually the same goal, or a watered-down version?
2. If watered down: is that acceptable, or does it defeat the purpose?
3. What's the honest probability of success?
4. Is the attempt worthwhile even if success isn't guaranteed?
5. What's Plan B if the critical path fails?

```
TRANSFORMATION:
Original "impossible" goal: [statement]
Impossibility type: [physical/logical/resource/knowledge/political/temporal/psychological]

Challenges to impossibility:
1. [claim] → [challenged because] → [status: still holds / weakened / refuted]

Analogies found: [N]
Best analogy: [description and principle extracted]

Decomposed path:
1. [sub-goal] — Status: achievable / uncertain / hard
2. [sub-goal] — Status: achievable / uncertain / hard

Critical barriers remaining: [list]
Probability assessment: [honest %]
Verdict: [achievable / achievable-if / still impossible / redefine needed]
```

## When to Use
- When a goal feels impossible but you're not ready to give up
- When told "that can't be done"
- When facing a seemingly intractable problem
- When you need to transform ambition into action

## Verification
- [ ] Goal stated precisely
- [ ] Impossibility classified by type
- [ ] Each impossibility claim challenged with evidence
- [ ] Analogies sought from other domains
- [ ] Goal decomposed into sub-goals
- [ ] Path constructed with ordering
- [ ] Honest probability assessed
