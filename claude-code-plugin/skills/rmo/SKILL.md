# Resume Optimization

## Overview
Systematic approach to crafting resumes that pass ATS filters, capture attention,
and effectively communicate value to hiring managers.

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather and inventory all experience
Create comprehensive inventory of your professional history:
1. List every job with:
   - Company, title, dates
   - Key responsibilities
   - All achievements (big and small)
   - Skills used and developed
   - Metrics and numbers available

2. For each achievement, capture:
   - What was the situation/challenge?
   - What did you specifically do?
   - What was the measurable result?
   - Who benefited and how?

3. List all skills:
   - Technical skills (tools, languages, platforms)
   - Domain knowledge (industries, functions)
   - Soft skills with evidence

This becomes your "master resume" for all future tailoring.

### Step 2: Analyze target role requirements
Decode what the role actually requires:
1. If you have a specific job description:
   - Highlight required qualifications
   - Note preferred qualifications
   - Identify keywords used repeatedly
   - Understand the implicit priorities

2. If targeting a role type generally:
   - Review 5-10 job postings for this role
   - Note common requirements across postings
   - Identify industry-standard terminology
   - Check LinkedIn profiles of people in the role

3. Map requirements to your experience:
   - Required: Must show evidence of these
   - Preferred: Include if you have them
   - Gaps: Address strategically or acknowledge

### Step 3: Select and prioritize content
Choose what to include based on relevance:
1. From your master inventory, select:
   - Experiences most relevant to target
   - Achievements that demonstrate required skills
   - Skills that match job requirements

2. Prioritize ruthlessly:
   - Most relevant experiences get more space
   - Recent experience weighted over old
   - Cut irrelevant experience entirely if needed
   - Aim for 1 page (early career) or 2 pages max (experienced)

3. Decide on sections:
   - Include summary if story needs context
   - Skills section if technical or for ATS
   - Projects if changing careers or new grad
   - Cut sections that don't add value

### Step 4: Write achievement-focused bullets
Transform your experience into compelling bullets:
1. For each role, write 3-6 bullets:
   - Lead with strong action verb
   - Include context (scope, challenge)
   - Describe your specific contribution
   - End with measurable result

2. Use CAR formula:
   - Challenge: What was the problem/opportunity?
   - Action: What did you specifically do?
   - Result: What was the outcome?

3. Quantify everything possible:
   - Revenue, users, cost savings
   - Percentages of improvement
   - Time saved, efficiency gained
   - Team size, project scope

4. Incorporate keywords naturally:
   - Use exact terms from job description
   - Don't keyword-stuff, integrate naturally

Power verbs by category:
- Leadership: Led, Directed, Orchestrated, Championed
- Achievement: Achieved, Exceeded, Delivered, Accomplished
- Creation: Built, Developed, Designed, Launched
- Improvement: Optimized, Streamlined, Enhanced, Transformed
- Analysis: Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Identified

### Step 5: Craft supporting sections
Complete remaining resume sections:

1. Summary (if including):
   - First sentence: Who you are (title, years, domain)
   - Second sentence: Key achievements or expertise
   - Third sentence: What you're seeking (optional)
   - Total: 2-4 sentences, no fluff

2. Skills section:
   - Group by category (Languages, Frameworks, Tools)
   - List in order of relevance to role
   - Include both technical and domain skills
   - Match terminology to job description

3. Education:
   - Most recent/relevant degree first
   - Include GPA only if >3.5 and recent grad
   - Add relevant coursework if new to field
   - Include certifications if relevant

4. Optional sections if space allows:
   - Projects: For career changers or to show initiative
   - Certifications: If specifically required
   - Awards: If notable and relevant

### Step 6: Format for ATS and humans
Apply formatting that works for both systems:

1. Structure:
   - Clear section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
   - Reverse chronological within sections
   - Consistent date format throughout
   - No tables, columns, or text boxes

2. Typography:
   - Standard font (Arial, Calibri, Garamond)
   - 10-12pt body text, slightly larger headers
   - Bold for company names and job titles
   - Bullets for achievements

3. Layout:
   - 0.5-1 inch margins
   - Adequate white space
   - 1 page for <10 years experience, 2 pages max for senior
   - Name and contact info at very top

4. File format:
   - Save as PDF (preserves formatting)
   - Use simple filename: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf
   - Keep .docx version for systems that require it

### Step 7: Review and refine
Quality check before submission:

1. Proofread thoroughly:
   - Read out loud to catch awkward phrasing
   - Check spelling, grammar, punctuation
   - Verify all dates and numbers
   - Ensure consistency (formatting, tense, style)

2. Test ATS compatibility:
   - Run through free ATS scanner (Jobscan, Resume Worded)
   - Check keyword match percentage
   - Verify parsing is accurate

3. Get feedback:
   - Ask someone in target industry to review
   - Request specific feedback on clarity and impact
   - Test: "After 10 seconds, what do you remember?"

4. Final checks:
   - Contact info is current and professional
   - No personal info that could cause bias
   - Links work (LinkedIn, portfolio)
   - File size reasonable (<5MB)


## When to Use
- Creating a new resume for job search
- Tailoring resume for specific application
- Resume not generating interviews (conversion problem)
- Career pivot requiring repositioning
- Major accomplishments to add
- Resume hasn't been updated in 2+ years

## Verification
- Every bullet starts with action verb
- Every bullet has measurable outcome or clear impact
- Keywords from target role appear naturally throughout
- Formatting is ATS-friendly (no tables, simple layout)
- Length is appropriate (1-2 pages max)
- Contact info is current and professional
- Zero errors (spelling, grammar, consistency)
