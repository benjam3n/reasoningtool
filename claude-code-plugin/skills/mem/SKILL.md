# Mental Models

## Overview
Build and apply a latticework of mental models for better thinking across domains

## Steps

### Step 1: Audit current mental models
Assess what models you already use (implicitly or explicitly):
1. List frameworks you consciously apply
2. Identify models from your professional domain
3. Notice patterns in how you analyze problems
4. Recognize models you use without naming them
5. Assess depth of understanding for each

Depth levels:
- Heard of it: Know the name, vague concept
- Understand it: Can explain core mechanism
- Apply it: Have used successfully in analysis
- Teach it: Can explain with examples and limitations

Questions to surface implicit models:
- "How do you typically approach [problem type]?"
- "What do you look for when analyzing [situation]?"
- "What patterns do you rely on?"

### Step 2: Identify model gaps
Find blind spots in your mental model repertoire:
1. Map current models to disciplines
2. Identify disciplines with no representation
3. Review problem types you face; which models would help?
4. Compare to model catalog; what high-value models are missing?
5. Prioritize gaps by frequency of applicability

Gap analysis:
- Discipline gaps: Missing whole domains (e.g., no economics models)
- Problem gaps: Common problems without relevant models
- Depth gaps: Models known but not deeply understood

High-priority gaps:
- Models applicable across many situations
- Models for decisions you face frequently
- Models from disciplines outside your training

### Step 3: Deepen priority models
For each priority model, develop real understanding:
1. Study the model's origin and core mechanism
2. Understand when it applies and when it doesn't
3. Learn common misapplications and limitations
4. Find examples across multiple domains
5. Connect to other models you know

Learning approach:
- Read/watch primary sources on the model
- Study worked examples of application
- Practice applying to varied situations
- Teach/explain to solidify understanding
- Note failure cases and boundary conditions

Understanding checklist:
- Can explain core mechanism in simple terms
- Can give examples from 3+ domains
- Know when model applies and doesn't
- Aware of common misapplications
- Can connect to related models

### Step 4: Build application triggers
Create recognition patterns for when to apply each model:
1. Identify situations where each model applies
2. Create "if-then" triggers for recognition
3. Build cue-model associations
4. Practice pattern recognition
5. Create checklists for complex situations

Trigger format:
"When I see [situation features], consider [model]"

Examples:
- "When I see someone's behavior confusing, consider incentives"
- "When I see rapid early growth, consider S-curves and regression"
- "When I see conflict, consider win-win negotiation (Fisher)"
- "When I see a system, look for feedback loops"

Practice recognition:
- Review past decisions: what model would have helped?
- Read case studies: which models apply?
- Discuss with others: what models do they see?

### Step 5: Practice multi-model analysis
Apply multiple models to the same situation:
1. Select a problem or situation to analyze
2. Cycle through relevant models one by one
3. Note what each model reveals
4. Look for agreement and conflict between models
5. Synthesize into integrated understanding

Multi-model approach:
- Different models reveal different aspects
- Agreement across models increases confidence
- Conflict indicates complexity or model limits
- Synthesis produces richer understanding

Practice format:
- Take a case study or current problem
- Apply at least 3 models from different disciplines
- Write what each reveals
- Note where they agree/disagree
- Form integrated view

### Step 6: Build the latticework
Connect models into an integrated thinking system:
1. Map relationships between models
2. Identify which models complement each other
3. Note which models conflict (and when each applies)
4. Create combinations for common problem types
5. Develop personal model "stacks" for frequent situations

Model relationships:
- Complementary: Different aspects of same situation
- Hierarchical: One model contains another
- Conflicting: Contradictory predictions (context-dependent)
- Analogous: Similar structure, different domains

Model stacks (example for business decisions):
- Incentives + Second-order effects + Opportunity cost
- Supply/demand + Competitive advantage + Niches
- Feedback loops + Critical mass + Power laws

### Step 7: Maintain and expand
Ongoing development of mental model capability:
1. Apply models in real decisions (best practice)
2. Reflect on which models helped (or would have)
3. Periodically learn new models (2-3 per year)
4. Deepen understanding of existing models
5. Refine application triggers based on experience

Maintenance activities:
- After decisions: Which models applied?
- After surprises: Which model would have predicted this?
- Periodic review: Which models am I underusing?
- New learning: What model from another field could help?

Expansion:
- Don't add models faster than you can deeply learn them
- Prioritize models with wide applicability
- Learn from practitioners who use models well
- Read broadly across disciplines


## When to Use
- Facing novel problems without established solutions
- Making decisions with incomplete information
- Analyzing complex systems or situations
- Building general reasoning ability
- When domain-specific expertise is insufficient
- Seeking multiple perspectives on a problem
- Designing or evaluating strategies
- Teaching or explaining complex situations

## Verification
- Models are understood deeply, not just named
- Multiple disciplines are represented
- Application triggers exist for common situations
- Multi-model analysis is practiced
- Models are connected into a latticework
- Models are applied in real decisions
- Limitations and misapplications are known
