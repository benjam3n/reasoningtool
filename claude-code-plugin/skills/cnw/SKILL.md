# Constraint Workaround Meta-Procedure

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

When you face a constraint that seems to block progress, NEVER give up. There is ALWAYS a workaround.

Most successful people started with constraints others would consider fatal. They found workarounds that others didn't think to look for. The arbitrage: systematically find workarounds that ad hoc thinking misses.

## Steps

### Step 1: Name the Constraint Precisely
Vague constraints have no solutions. Precise constraints have many.

1. What exactly is blocked?
2. What exactly is blocking it?
3. Is this ACTUALLY a constraint, or just a perceived one?
4. Who says this is a constraint? Are they right?

**Constraint types:**
| Type | Example | Typical Workaround Direction |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Resource (money) | "Can't afford X" | Bootstrap, barter, find it free, earn it |
| Resource (time) | "Don't have time" | Delegate, automate, reduce scope, parallelize |
| Access | "Can't reach Y" | Find intermediary, find alternative, build own |
| Authority | "Not allowed to Z" | Get permission, find who can, reframe |
| Knowledge | "Don't know how" | Learn, hire, find who does, use AI |
| Skill | "Can't do X well" | Practice, partner, tool up, lower bar |
| Physical | "Not physically possible" | Redefine, approximate, find adjacent |
| Legal/regulatory | "Not permitted" | Different jurisdiction, different structure, comply |

### Step 2: Apply the Workaround Hierarchy
Try each level in order. Stop when you find one that works:

**Level 1: Eliminate** — Is the constraint actually necessary?
- Does the goal REALLY require what's constrained?
- Can you redefine the goal to avoid the constraint?
- Is the constraint based on an assumption you can challenge?

**Level 2: Substitute** — Can something else serve the same function?
- What alternatives exist?
- What would a person in a different field use?
- What's the cheapest/fastest/easiest substitute?

**Level 3: Borrow** — Can someone else provide what you need?
- Who has excess capacity of what you lack?
- What partnerships would solve this?
- Can you barter (trade what you have for what you need)?

**Level 4: Sequence** — Can you do it in a different order?
- Can you start with what you have and earn the rest along the way?
- Can you do a smaller version first that generates resources for the full version?
- Can you bootstrap?

**Level 5: Transform** — Can you change the nature of the constraint?
- Can you make the constraint into an advantage?
- Can you change the rules?
- Can you reframe the problem so the constraint doesn't apply?

**Level 6: Endure** — Can you push through despite the constraint?
- Can you do it slower but still do it?
- Can you accept a worse version that still achieves the core goal?
- Can you break it into pieces small enough to get past the constraint?

### Step 3: Generate Specific Workarounds
For each applicable level, generate concrete options:

| Level | Workaround | Feasibility | Effort | Risk |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|------|
| [level] | [specific workaround] | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L |

Generate at least 5 workarounds before evaluating any.

### Step 4: Evaluate Workarounds
For each workaround:
1. Does it actually solve the constraint? (Not just partially)
2. Does it create new constraints? (Don't trade one prison for another)
3. Is it sustainable? (Not just a one-time fix)
4. Is it aligned with the goal? (Not just a clever hack that misses the point)

### Step 5: Check for Self-Sabotage
Common reasons people don't see workarounds:
- **Learned helplessness**: "It can't be done" (without actually trying)
- **Status quo bias**: "This is how things work" (but who decided?)
- **Anchoring**: Fixated on the blocked path instead of looking for others
- **Identity**: "I'm not the kind of person who..." (constraint is actually self-imposed)
- **Comfort**: The constraint provides an excuse not to try

Honest question: Do you WANT to find a workaround, or does the constraint serve a hidden purpose?

### Step 6: Report
```
CONSTRAINT WORKAROUND:
Constraint: [precise description]
Type: [resource/access/authority/knowledge/skill/physical/legal]
Genuine: [yes / actually a perceived constraint]

Workarounds found:
| # | Level | Workaround | Feasibility | New Risks |
|---|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | [level] | [what] | [H/M/L] | [what new problems] |

Recommended: [best workaround]
Why: [feasible + doesn't create worse problems + aligned with goal]

Self-sabotage check: [any hidden reasons for accepting the constraint]
```

## When to Use
- You've identified a constraint that seems to block the goal
- System is tempted to say "you can't do this because..."
- Resource/authority/access gap seems insurmountable
- → INVOKE: /grfr (goal reframing) if constraint reveals goal needs reframing
- → INVOKE: /foht (figure out how to) for method discovery

## Verification
- [ ] Constraint precisely named (not vague)
- [ ] Constraint verified as genuine (not just assumed)
- [ ] All 6 workaround levels attempted
- [ ] At least 5 workarounds generated before evaluation
- [ ] Workarounds checked for new constraints they create
- [ ] Self-sabotage check performed
