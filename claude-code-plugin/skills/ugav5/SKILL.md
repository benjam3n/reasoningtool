# Universal Goal Analysis Framework v5

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The comprehensive question framework v5. Adds extensive analysis categories: causation, prediction, assumptions, biases, system dynamics, strategic interaction. Adds operational categories: delegation, capacity, handoffs, queues, interruptions. Adds meta-cognitive categories: cognitive load, attention allocation, sustained effort. Adds quality categories: validation, consistency, simplicity, metric gaming.

## Steps

### Step 1: STANDARD ANALYSIS
Apply the core framework from v4:
- → INVOKE: /ugav4 for base analysis (goal, situation, leverage, strategy, action, risk, communication, meta)

Then continue with v5 extensions below.

### Step 2: CAUSATION AND PREDICTION
1. Is there a known causal model for this domain? (What causes what?)
2. Which causal links are proven vs assumed?
3. What predictions does your strategy make? (If I do X, Y should happen by Z date)
4. How will you test those predictions?
5. What would DISPROVE your causal model? (If this doesn't happen, the model is wrong)

### Step 3: ASSUMPTIONS AND BELIEFS
1. List every assumption your strategy depends on
2. For each: is it tested or untested?
3. For each untested assumption: what's the cost of testing it now vs learning it's wrong later?
4. What beliefs do you hold about this domain that you've never questioned?
5. What would someone who DISAGREES with your approach say? What's the strongest version of their argument?

### Step 4: BIASES AND MENTAL MODELS
1. Is there a sunk cost influencing continued pursuit? (Would you start this today given current state?)
2. Is there anchoring on an initial estimate/plan that may be wrong?
3. Is there confirmation bias in your evidence gathering?
4. What mental model are you using? (E.g., "this is like a race" or "this is like gardening")
5. What does your mental model HIDE? (What aspects of reality doesn't it capture?)

### Step 5: SYSTEM DYNAMICS
1. Are there feedback loops? (Actions that amplify or dampen themselves)
2. Are there delays between action and effect? How long?
3. Are there thresholds? (Points where behavior changes dramatically)
4. Is the system stable or chaotic? (Small changes → small effects, or small changes → big effects?)
5. Are there emergent behaviors? (System-level outcomes not predictable from parts)

### Step 6: STRATEGIC INTERACTION
1. Is there a competitor/adversary? What are they optimizing for?
2. Will they react to your actions? How?
3. Is this zero-sum (your gain = their loss) or positive-sum (both can win)?
4. Is this a repeated game (you'll interact again) or one-shot?
5. What information do they have about your strategy?

### Step 7: OPERATIONAL CATEGORIES
7a. **Delegation:**
- What tasks can ONLY you do? What can others do?
- For delegated tasks: is the output quality acceptable?
- What's the cost of quality loss vs the cost of doing it yourself?

7b. **Capacity and Load:**
- What's your current capacity utilization? (% of maximum sustainable output)
- Is there slack? (If not, any disruption will cause cascade failure)
- What would you cut to create 20% slack?

7c. **Queues and Handoffs:**
- Where does work wait for someone? How long?
- Where are the handoff points? (Work passes from one person/system to another)
- What information is lost at handoffs?

7d. **Interruptions:**
- What interrupts the most important work? How often?
- What's the cost of each interruption? (Switching cost + recovery time)
- How to protect the most important work from interruption?

### Step 8: META-COGNITIVE CATEGORIES
1. **Cognitive load:** Is this goal consuming mental bandwidth beyond work time? Is that sustainable?
2. **Attention allocation:** What % of your attention goes to this vs other goals? Is that the right allocation?
3. **Sustained effort:** Can you maintain the required effort for the required duration? What's the burnout risk?
4. **Decision fatigue:** How many decisions does this goal require per day/week? Can any be automated or pre-decided?

### Step 9: QUALITY CATEGORIES
1. **Validation:** How do you know your output is correct? (Not "it feels right")
2. **Consistency:** Are you applying the same standards across similar decisions?
3. **Simplicity:** Is there a simpler approach that achieves 80% of the result?
4. **Metric gaming:** Are you optimizing the metric instead of the actual outcome?

### Step 10: Report
```
GOAL ANALYSIS v5:
[Include v4 report first, then add:]

Causal model: [known/assumed/unknown]
Key predictions: [if X then Y by Z]
Untested assumptions: [N — top 3 listed]
Active biases: [which ones detected]
System dynamics: [feedback loops, delays, thresholds]
Strategic interaction: [competitive dynamics]

Operational:
- Capacity utilization: [%]
- Main queue/bottleneck: [where]
- Interruption cost: [hours/week]

Meta-cognitive:
- Cognitive load: [sustainable/unsustainable]
- Attention allocation: [% to this goal]
- Burnout risk: [H/M/L]

Quality:
- Validation method: [how you know it's working]
- Simplification opportunity: [if any]
- Metric gaming risk: [what you might be optimizing wrong]
```

## When to Use
- Any new goal (most comprehensive version)
- Goals in complex systems with many interacting parts
- Goals requiring long sustained effort
- Goals in competitive/adversarial contexts
- → See also: /ugav2 (simple), /ugav3 (structured), /ugav4 (balanced)

## Verification
- [ ] Base v4 analysis completed
- [ ] Causal model assessed and predictions stated
- [ ] Assumptions listed and tested/untested status noted
- [ ] Biases actively checked
- [ ] System dynamics mapped
- [ ] Operational load assessed
- [ ] Meta-cognitive sustainability checked
- [ ] Quality validation method defined
