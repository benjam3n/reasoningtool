# Military Strategy Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Military doctrine has centuries of refinement in operating under uncertainty, time pressure, competition, and distributed execution. These principles apply to any competitive or high-stakes sequential decision-making.

## Core Principle

Concentrate resources at the decisive point. Don't spread thin across all fronts. Win where it matters most, accept risk elsewhere.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Schwerpunkt — Main Effort First
- Identify the decisive point (where success or failure is determined)
- Concentrate resources there
- Accept risk on secondary objectives
- **When**: limited resources, multiple fronts, need to choose where to win

### Rule 2: Secure Rear Before Advancing
- Don't advance until supply lines and fallback positions are secure
- In projects: don't scale until foundation is solid
- **When**: dependency on previous work, risk of overextension

### Rule 3: OODA Loop — Tempo Advantage
- Observe → Orient → Decide → Act, faster than the competition
- Speed of decision-making matters more than perfection
- **When**: competitive situations, changing environments

### Rule 4: Economy of Force
- Use minimum necessary resources on secondary objectives
- Free up maximum resources for main effort
- **When**: resource-constrained, multiple objectives

### Rule 5: Surprise and Initiative
- Do the unexpected. Act before the other side can react.
- Being predictable is a disadvantage
- **When**: competitive situations, first-mover advantages

### Rule 6: Unity of Command
- One person/entity makes decisions for each operation
- Avoid committee decisions in time-critical situations
- **When**: coordination across teams, fast-moving operations

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Decisive Point
- Where is the battle won or lost?
- What is the one thing that matters most?

### Step 2: Allocate Resources
- Main effort: maximum resources
- Supporting efforts: minimum necessary
- Reserve: keep something back for unexpected developments

### Step 3: Maintain Tempo
- Act faster than the situation changes
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough

## When to Use
- Competitive business situations
- Time-pressured projects with trade-offs
- Any situation with active opposition
- Resource allocation under constraint

## Verification
- [ ] Decisive point identified
- [ ] Resources concentrated at main effort
- [ ] Rear/foundations secured
- [ ] Decision tempo maintained
