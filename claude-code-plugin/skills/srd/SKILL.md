# Strategic Competitive Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

In competitive environments, the order of your moves communicates information and shapes opponent behavior. These orderings are for legitimate competitive contexts: business strategy, sports, games, debates.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Feint Then Strike
- Signal intent in one direction, execute in another
- Force opponent to commit resources to the wrong area
- **When**: competitive situations where misdirection is legitimate

### Rule 2: Strength from Weakness Ordering
- Present apparent weakness to draw opponent into overcommitting
- Then reveal actual capability
- **When**: negotiations, competitive positioning

### Rule 3: Tempo Control
- Alternate fast and slow moves to disrupt opponent's rhythm
- When they expect speed, go slow. When they expect deliberation, move fast.
- **When**: any sequential competitive interaction

### Rule 4: Sequential Revelation
- Don't reveal your full position at once
- Each revelation should change the strategic landscape in your favor
- **When**: negotiations, product launches, competitive announcements

### Rule 5: Precommitment
- Sometimes irrevocably committing first creates advantage
- "Burning bridges" forces opponents to adapt to your position
- **When**: credibility matters, first-mover advantage exists

## Application
1. Identify the competitive dynamic (who, what stakes, what information)
2. Choose ordering based on information asymmetry and position
3. Execute while monitoring opponent response
4. Adapt sequence based on opponent's moves

## When to Use
- Business competition, sports strategy, debate
- Any situation with active opponents reacting to your moves

## Verification
- [ ] Competitive dynamic understood
- [ ] Ordering accounts for opponent's likely responses
- [ ] Legitimate competitive context (not deception for harm)
- [ ] Adaptable to opponent's actual responses
