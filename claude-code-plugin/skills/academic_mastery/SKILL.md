# Academic Mastery

## Overview
Master academic subjects through structured learning, concept mapping, and competency verification

## Steps

### Step 1: Define mastery scope
Clarify what mastery means for your specific goal:
1. What should you be able to DO after mastery?
   - Solve problems? Read papers? Teach? Apply to other domains?
2. What level is needed?
   - Undergraduate, graduate, research-level?
3. What related topics are in/out of scope?
   - What's essential vs. nice-to-have?
4. What's the time commitment available?
   - Realistic weekly hours and total timeline
5. What does success look like concretely?
   - Specific papers to read, problems to solve, exams to pass

### Step 2: Map prerequisites
Identify what you need to know first:
1. Research what background the subject assumes
   - Check textbook prefaces, course prerequisites
2. Assess your current knowledge of these prerequisites
   - Be honest about gaps
3. List gaps that must be filled first
   - Distinguish blocking gaps from nice-to-have
4. Order prerequisites by dependency
   - What requires what?
5. Estimate time needed for prerequisite work

Common prerequisite categories:
- Mathematical maturity (proof techniques, abstraction)
- Notation and terminology
- Foundational concepts the subject builds on
- Related fields that provide context

### Step 3: Identify sources
Find the best learning materials:
1. Canonical textbooks
   - Ask experts, check university syllabi, read reviews
   - Look for "standard reference" mentions
2. Lecture notes and videos
   - University courses (MIT OCW, etc.)
   - Summer schools, workshops
3. Research papers (for advanced topics)
   - Survey papers for overview
   - Original papers for depth
4. Practice problems and exercises
   - Problem sets from courses
   - Competition problems
   - Textbook exercises

Prioritize: clarity > comprehensiveness for initial learning
Note: Multiple sources help see concepts from different angles

### Step 4: Build concept dependency graph
Map the structure of the subject:
1. List major concepts, definitions, and theorems
   - Skim table of contents, indices
   - Note what appears repeatedly
2. Identify dependencies (concept A requires B)
   - What must you understand to understand this?
3. Create dependency graph
   - Visual or textual representation
4. Identify foundational vs. advanced concepts
   - What's the base, what builds on it?
5. Note which concepts are most important for your goal
   - Not all concepts are equally relevant

Concept types:
- Definitions: new terms and their meanings
- Constructions: how to build mathematical objects
- Theorems: key results and their implications
- Techniques: proof methods, calculation approaches

### Step 5: Design learning path
Create ordered study sequence:
1. Topologically sort concept graph
   - Respect dependencies
2. Map concepts to source materials
   - Which chapter/lecture covers what?
3. Estimate time per section
   - Be realistic, include problem time
4. Build in review intervals
   - Schedule revisiting earlier material
5. Create checkpoints for progress verification
   - What should you be able to do after each section?

Path structure:
- Modules: logical groupings of related concepts
- Sessions: individual study units (2-4 hours)
- Milestones: checkpoints with verification

### Step 6: Execute active learning
For each concept/section:
1. Read/watch primary material
   - Take rough notes, mark confusions
2. Take notes in your own words (not copying)
   - Reformulate definitions
   - Restate theorems
3. Work through examples manually
   - Don't just read - do
4. Attempt exercises BEFORE checking solutions
   - Struggle is where learning happens
5. Explain concept aloud (Feynman technique)
   - If you can't explain simply, you don't understand
6. Connect to concepts already learned
   - How does this relate to what you know?
7. Identify remaining confusions
   - What's still unclear?

Warning signs of passive learning:
- Can follow explanations but can't produce them
- Skip exercises or check answers immediately
- Notes are copies, not reformulations

### Step 7: Verify competency
Test actual understanding rigorously:
1. Solve problems from different sources
   - Not just same textbook
2. Answer conceptual questions (not just computation)
   - "Why does this work?" "What if we changed X?"
3. Explain to someone else (or rubber duck)
   - Teaching reveals gaps
4. Apply to novel examples
   - Can you use this in new contexts?
5. Identify edge cases and exceptions
   - Where does this break down?

If struggling:
- Return to Step 6, re-study the concept
- Try different source for fresh perspective
- Identify specific gap in understanding
- Seek help (forums, teachers, peers)


## When to Use
- Learning mathematics, logic, or formal systems
- Studying philosophy or theoretical subjects
- Self-directed study of complex academic material
- Preparing for research or professional application requiring deep knowledge
- When genuine understanding matters (not just passing familiarity)
- Building foundational knowledge for a new field
- Reading academic papers that require background knowledge
- Preparing for graduate-level work or research

## Verification
- Prerequisites are identified and addressed before main study
- Concept dependencies are mapped and respected in study order
- Active learning methods are used (not passive reading)
- Exercises are attempted before checking solutions
- Competency is verified through problem-solving, not just recognition
- Spaced repetition maintains knowledge over time
- Can explain concepts in own words without notes
