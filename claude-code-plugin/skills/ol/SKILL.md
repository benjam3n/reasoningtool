## Overview

In competitive environments, the entity that can cycle through observe-orient-decide-act faster than opponents gains decisive advantage.

Originally developed to explain why F-86 pilots defeated superior MiG-15s at 10:1 ratios in the Korean War. The answer wasn't better planes but faster decision cycles — the F-86's bubble canopy and hydraulic controls let pilots observe and react faster.

Key insight: It's not just about speed, but about getting "inside" your opponent's decision loop, disrupting their orientation.

## Steps

### Step 1: OBSERVE — Gather Information
What's happening right now?

1. **Direct observation**: What can you see, measure, detect?
2. **External sources**: What are others reporting?
3. **Signal detection**: What's new or changed since last cycle?
4. **Anomalies**: What doesn't match expectations?
5. **Missing signals**: What should you be seeing but aren't?

**Quality matters more than quantity.** A few accurate observations beat mountains of data you can't process.

```
OBSERVATIONS:
1. [what you observe] — confidence: [H/M/L] — source: [how you know]
2. [observation]
3. [observation]
Key change since last cycle: [what's new]
```

### Step 2: ORIENT — Make Sense of Observations
**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step.** Orientation is the lens through which you interpret reality.

Orientation is shaped by:
1. **Previous experience**: What patterns do you recognize?
2. **Cultural traditions**: What does your culture/organization assume?
3. **Genetic heritage**: What cognitive biases are active?
4. **New information**: What do current observations suggest?
5. **Analysis/synthesis**: How do you connect the dots?

**Key questions:**
- What do these observations MEAN?
- What is the situation ACTUALLY? (Not what you want it to be)
- What is changing and in which direction?
- What mental model am I using? Is it still accurate?
- What would someone with a DIFFERENT mental model see?

**Orientation traps:**
| Trap | Description | Counter |
|------|------------|---------|
| Fighting the last war | Applying old patterns to new situation | Ask "what's different THIS time?" |
| Wishful thinking | Seeing what you want to see | Ask "what would a pessimist see?" |
| Confirmation bias | Only noticing supporting evidence | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| Complexity collapse | Oversimplifying to make it manageable | Hold complexity; don't resolve prematurely |

### Step 3: DECIDE — Choose a Course of Action
Based on your orientation:

1. What options are available?
2. Which option best addresses the situation as oriented?
3. What is the FASTEST option that's good enough? (Not perfect — good enough)
4. What is the decision's reversibility? (Irreversible → more caution; reversible → bias to speed)

**Decision speed rules:**
- If reversible and low-stakes: Decide immediately
- If reversible and high-stakes: Decide within one cycle
- If irreversible and low-stakes: Decide within one cycle
- If irreversible and high-stakes: Take one extra cycle maximum

**Avoid analysis paralysis:** A good decision now beats a perfect decision too late.

### Step 4: ACT — Execute
1. Act on the decision
2. Act FAST — delay erodes the advantage of the entire cycle
3. Act CLEANLY — ambiguous action creates ambiguous feedback
4. Observe the results of your action (feeds into next OBSERVE)

### Step 5: Cycle — Repeat Faster
The power isn't one cycle — it's cycling faster than the environment/opponent:

**Increasing cycle speed:**
- Reduce observation lag (better sensors, closer to the action)
- Improve orientation (better mental models, less bias)
- Streamline decisions (pre-decide for common scenarios)
- Remove action friction (authority to act without approval chains)

**Disrupting opponent's cycle:**
- Create ambiguity (make them uncertain what they're observing)
- Overload their orientation (present them with more situations than they can model)
- Invalidate their decisions (change the situation between their DECIDE and ACT)
- Increase their action friction (add obstacles between their decisions and execution)

### Step 6: Apply to Input
1. What is the competitive/dynamic situation?
2. Where are you in the OODA loop right now?
3. What's your current cycle time? Can it be reduced?
4. Where is the bottleneck? (Usually ORIENT)
5. Can you get inside your opponent's loop?

### Step 7: Report
```
OODA LOOP ANALYSIS:
Situation: [competitive context]

Current cycle:
OBSERVE: [key observations]
ORIENT: [interpretation/mental model]
DECIDE: [chosen action]
ACT: [execution plan]

Cycle speed: [fast/moderate/slow relative to opponent]
Bottleneck: [which step is slowest]
Speed-up opportunity: [how to cycle faster]

Opponent disruption: [how to disrupt their cycle]
Next cycle trigger: [what to watch for to start next OBSERVE]
```

## When to Use
- Competitive situations with time pressure
- Fast-moving environments requiring rapid adaptation
- Adversarial contexts (business competition, negotiation, games)
- Crisis response and incident management
- → INVOKE: /mil (military ordering) for military-derived strategies
- → INVOKE: /ct (crisis triage) for resource-constrained urgency

## Verification
- [ ] All four phases completed (not skipping ORIENT)
- [ ] ORIENT phase checked for biases
- [ ] Decision speed appropriate to reversibility and stakes
- [ ] Action executed cleanly (not ambiguously)
- [ ] Next cycle initiated (not stopping after one pass)
- [ ] Cycle speed assessed relative to opponent/environment
