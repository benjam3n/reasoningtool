# Personal Optimization

## Overview
N-of-1 experimentation framework for systematically improving personal health,
habits, and performance through baseline measurement, intervention testing, and iteration.

## Steps

### Step 1: Outcome Definition
Define what you're optimizing:
1. Primary outcome: One specific measurable variable
2. Secondary outcomes: Related variables to monitor
3. Measurement method: How will you measure? (subjective scale, device, etc.)
4. Timeframe: When do you measure? (daily, weekly)

Be specific: "energy level 1-10 at 3pm" not just "more energy"

### Step 2: Baseline Measurement
Establish current state WITHOUT intervention:
1. Measure for 1-2 weeks with no changes
2. Record at consistent times
3. Note confounders (stress, travel, illness)
4. Calculate average and variation

This is critical: skip and you can't know if intervention worked

### Step 3: Intervention Selection
Choose ONE intervention to test:
1. Research evidence-based options
2. Consider ease of implementation
3. Assess safety and risks
4. Start with most likely to work OR easiest

Only ONE at a time - multiple changes = can't attribute effects

### Step 4: Protocol Design
Design the experiment:
1. Duration: Minimum 2 weeks per phase
2. Washout: Time between interventions (if any)
3. Control conditions: What stays constant
4. Measurement protocol: Same as baseline
5. Exit criteria: When to abandon if harmful

### Step 5: Intervention Execution
Run the experiment:
1. Implement intervention consistently
2. Continue measuring outcomes
3. Log compliance (did you actually do it?)
4. Note confounders and unusual events
5. Do NOT judge results mid-experiment

### Step 6: Analysis
Evaluate results:
1. Compare intervention period to baseline
2. Calculate effect size (how much change?)
3. Assess consistency (did it work every time?)
4. Consider placebo/regression to mean
5. Note any side effects

Ask: Would I bet money this intervention caused the change?

### Step 7: Decision
Decide based on results:
- Clear positive effect: KEEP intervention, integrate into routine
- No effect: DROP intervention, try different one
- Unclear: Extend experiment or run reversal (ABA design)
- Negative effect: STOP immediately

### Step 8: Integration or Iteration
If keeping intervention:
1. Document what works
2. Simplify to minimum effective protocol
3. Build into routine/system
4. Continue monitoring (effects can fade)

If trying next intervention:
1. Return to baseline measurement (washout)
2. Select next intervention
3. Repeat from step 4


## When to Use
- Health improvement projects (sleep, exercise, nutrition)
- Habit formation and behavioral change
- Performance optimization
- When population studies don't match individual response

## Verification
- Baseline established before any intervention
- Only one variable changed at a time
- Effect measured objectively
- Results documented for future reference
