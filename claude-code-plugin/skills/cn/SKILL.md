# Communication Narrative Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The order you present information determines whether your audience understands it, remembers it, and acts on it. Different communication goals require different orderings. This provides proven narrative structures.

## Core Principle

Audiences process information sequentially. The first thing they hear frames everything after. The last thing they hear is what they remember. Structure accordingly.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Pyramid — Conclusion First
- Lead with the answer/recommendation
- Then supporting arguments
- Then evidence and details
- **When**: busy audience, executive communication, news writing
- **Why**: if they stop reading/listening at any point, they got the most important part

### Rule 2: Narrative Arc — Problem → Journey → Resolution
- Establish the problem/tension
- Walk through the journey/analysis
- Arrive at the resolution
- **When**: need audience buy-in, persuasion, storytelling
- **Why**: creates engagement through tension and resolution

### Rule 3: Layered — Overview → Detail → Deep Dive
- Start with the 30-second version
- Then the 5-minute version
- Then the full detail
- **When**: mixed audience (some want overview, some want depth)
- **Why**: everyone gets what they need, nobody sits through what they don't

### Rule 4: Compare and Contrast — Side by Side
- Present Option A and Option B in parallel
- Compare on each dimension
- Synthesize recommendation
- **When**: presenting choices, evaluation results
- **Why**: makes differences visible and comparison easy

### Rule 5: Chronological — First Things First
- Present events in time order
- **When**: process documentation, incident reports, tutorials
- **Why**: matches how things actually happened/should happen

### Rule 6: Most Important First — Descending Priority
- Rank all points by importance
- Present in descending order
- **When**: limited attention span, information dump
- **Why**: ensures most important points get heard even if time runs out

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Communication Goal
- Inform → Pyramid or Layered
- Persuade → Narrative Arc
- Compare → Compare and Contrast
- Teach → Chronological or Layered
- Report → Chronological or Most Important First

### Step 2: Identify Audience
- Executive → Pyramid (time-constrained, want bottom line)
- Technical → Layered (want to go deep on what matters)
- General → Narrative Arc (need engagement)
- Mixed → Layered (self-selecting depth)

### Step 3: Apply and Verify
- Structure content per chosen ordering
- Check: does each section flow from the previous?
- Check: if they only read the first 20%, do they get the key message?

## Anti-Patterns
- Burying the lead (conclusion last when audience is busy)
- Data dump (no ordering principle at all)
- Chronological for persuasion (boring, no tension)

## When to Use
- Presentations, memos, reports, proposals
- Any communication where structure matters

## Verification
- [ ] Communication goal identified
- [ ] Ordering matched to goal and audience
- [ ] Key message accessible early
- [ ] Flow is logical between sections
