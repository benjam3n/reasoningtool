# Language Goal Identification

## Overview
All language has a goal - it's trying to achieve something.
This procedure identifies what that goal is, which enables:
- Evaluation of whether the language achieves its goal
- Understanding WHY something was said
- Filtering illegitimate or confused communication

## Core Principle
The goal of language is more sophisticated than surface categories
like "inform," "persuade," "express." The deeper question is:
What state is the speaker trying to bring about?

## Steps

### Step 1: Receive the language
Take the statement, question, or communication to analyze.
Note the exact wording and context.

### Step 2: Identify surface layer
What is the grammatical form?
- Declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory?

This is the starting point, not the answer.

### Step 3: Identify functional layer
What is this language DOING?

Ask: If this language "succeeds," what has changed?
- Someone knows something they didn't? (Inform)
- Someone believes something they didn't? (Persuade)
- Someone does something they wouldn't have? (Direct)
- A relationship state changes? (Social function)
- The speaker has expressed something? (Express)

### Step 4: Identify need layer
WHY is the speaker pursuing this function?

Ask: What need is met if the function succeeds?
- Need to know/understand? (Epistemic)
- Need to act/decide? (Practical)
- Need for connection? (Social)
- Need to process feeling? (Emotional)
- Need to protect position? (Defensive)
- Need specific outcome? (Strategic)

### Step 5: Trace to intrinsic layer (if needed)
For deeper analysis, ask: WHY this need?

Keep asking "why?" until reaching intrinsic values:
- Wellbeing, truth, connection, security, meaning, etc.

This is optional for most applications but necessary for
goal-structure reconstruction.

### Step 6: State the goal
Synthesize the layers into a goal statement:

"[Speaker] is [doing X] because they [need Y] in service of [value Z]."

Or shorter: "The goal is [Y]."
