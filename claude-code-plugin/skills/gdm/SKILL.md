# Group Decision Making

## Overview
Systematic procedure for making effective decisions in groups, avoiding common pitfalls, and leveraging collective intelligence

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the decision and authority
Clarify what's being decided and who decides:
1. State the decision question clearly
2. Explain why group input is needed
3. Clarify the decision-making structure (consensus, vote, consultative)
4. Name the ultimate decision-maker if consultative
5. Explain what happens with the input

### Step 2: Gather independent input first
Collect unbiased perspectives before group discussion:
1. Have each participant write their initial view independently
2. Include: position, key reasons, concerns, and confidence level
3. Collect anonymously if possible to prevent anchoring
4. Do this BEFORE any group discussion
5. This prevents information cascades and groupthink

### Step 3: Generate and expand options
Ensure a full range of options is considered:
1. Share any pre-defined options
2. Brainstorm additional options (no critique during generation)
3. Include "do nothing" or status quo
4. Look for creative alternatives beyond obvious choices
5. Combine or modify options

### Step 4: Structured discussion with dissent
Facilitate discussion that welcomes disagreement:
1. Present summary of independent views (anonymized if helpful)
2. For each option, have someone advocate for it
3. Assign devil's advocate to challenge favored options
4. Explicitly ask: "What are we missing? What could go wrong?"
5. Ensure quieter voices are heard (round-robin or direct invitation)
6. Leader speaks last to avoid anchoring

### Step 5: Check for groupthink
Actively look for signs of premature consensus:
1. Is apparent agreement too quick or easy?
2. Have concerns been suppressed or dismissed?
3. Is anyone holding back?
4. Do a round: "What's one thing that still concerns you?"
5. Consider bringing in outside perspective

### Step 6: Decide using agreed method
Make the decision using the appropriate structure:
1. If consensus: Check each person for agreement and concerns
2. If voting: Conduct vote using chosen method
3. If consultative: Decision-maker states decision with rationale
4. Document the decision clearly
5. Acknowledge dissenting views and how they were considered

### Step 7: Commit and plan implementation
Ensure commitment and clear next steps:
1. Each participant states their commitment to support the decision
2. Even dissenters: "Disagree and commit" - will they support implementation?
3. Assign specific actions with owners and deadlines
4. Identify early warning signs to watch for
5. Schedule review point to assess decision outcome


## When to Use
- Decision requires multiple areas of expertise
- Implementation depends on stakeholder buy-in
- Decision affects many people who should have input
- Want to reduce individual bias and blind spots
- Complex problem benefits from diverse perspectives
- Need to build legitimacy for the decision
- Individual decision-maker lacks complete information

## Verification
- Decision authority clearly established before process
- Independent input gathered before group discussion
- Multiple options seriously considered
- Dissent explicitly welcomed and documented
- Groupthink check performed
- All participants committed to support implementation
- Review point scheduled
