# Knowledge to Action

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## STEP 0: What kind of inaction are you experiencing?

Write down the action you're not taking. Then classify:

| Your situation looks like... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| "I know the exact action but keep not doing it" | SECTION A (Blocked Action) |
| "I know the goal but not the specific next step" | SECTION B (Unclear Path) |
| "I keep starting but can't sustain it" | SECTION C (Abandoned Action) |
| "I'm doing things, but not the right things" | SECTION D (Displacement Activity) |
| "I don't know why I'm stuck" | SECTION E (Diagnosis) |

---

### SECTION A: Blocked Action -- "I know what to do but can't make myself do it"

**Step A1: Shrink the action until it's laughably small.**
- Whatever you think the action is, make it smaller.
- "Write the report" -> "Write one paragraph" -> "Write one sentence" -> "Open the document"
- Keep shrinking until you hit an action you could do RIGHT NOW in under 2 minutes.
- **What you should see**: An action so small it feels ridiculous to not do it.

**Step A2: Do the shrunken action. Right now. Before reading the next step.**
- Seriously. Do it. Then come back.
- Did you do it?
  - YES -> Go to Step A3.
  - NO, and the reason is logistical (not at my computer, etc.) -> Schedule a specific time within 24 hours. Write it down. Set an alarm. Go to Step A3 at that time.
  - NO, and I felt resistance even for the tiny action -> **Your blocker is emotional, not practical.** Go to SECTION E, Step E3.

**Step A3: Now do the next-smallest increment.**
- Don't plan the whole sequence. Just do the next small piece.
- After each piece, ask: "Can I do one more small piece?"
  - YES -> Do it.
  - NO, I'm done for now -> That's fine. Write down exactly where you stopped and what the next tiny action is. Schedule when you'll do it.
- **What you should see**: More progress in 20 minutes of tiny steps than in weeks of planning.

**Step A4: After you've started, build a trigger.**
- A trigger is an existing daily event that you attach the action to.
- Formula: "After I [thing I already do every day], I will [small version of the action]."
- Examples: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write one paragraph." "After I close my laptop at end of day, I will send one outreach email."
- **What you should see**: A specific trigger written down, connected to a specific tiny action.

-> Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION B: Unclear Path -- "I know the goal but not the next step"

**Step B1: Write down the goal. Then answer: "What would be true the moment BEFORE the goal is achieved?"**
- Not the end state -- the state one step before the end.
- Example: Goal = "Launch the product." One step before = "Product is deployed and tested."
- **What you should see**: A concrete pre-condition.

**Step B2: Keep going backward. What would be true the moment before THAT?**
- Repeat until you arrive at something that IS ALREADY TRUE right now.
- **What you should see**: A chain of states from "now" to "goal achieved."

**Step B3: Find the first gap -- the transition from a true state to a not-yet-true state.**
- That transition is your actual next action.
- If that transition is still too big, break IT down using the same backward technique.
- **What you should see**: A single, concrete action you can take today.

**Step B4: Is there anything you need BEFORE you can take that action?**
- If YES -> That prerequisite is your real next action. Address it first.
- If NO -> Go to Section A, Step A1 with this action.

-> Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

---

### SECTION C: Abandoned Action -- "I keep starting but can't sustain it"

**Step C1: How many times have you started and stopped?**
- 1-2 times -> You haven't really tried yet. Go to Section A.
- 3+ times -> There's a structural problem. Continue to Step C2.

**Step C2: At what point do you stop each time?**
- Write down specifically when you quit. Look for the pattern.
  - "I stop when it gets hard" -> Go to Step C3.
  - "I stop when something else comes up" -> Go to Step C4.
  - "I stop when I don't see results" -> Go to Step C5.
  - "I don't know, I just... stop" -> Go to Step C6.

**Step C3: The difficulty wall.**
- You're hitting the point where the learning curve steepens or the work gets genuinely challenging.
- Action: Break the hard part into sub-parts. Which specific sub-part stops you? Address ONLY that sub-part.
- If the sub-part requires a skill you don't have -> learn that specific skill first.
- **What you should see**: The intimidating monolith broken into manageable pieces.

**Step C4: Competing commitments.**
- List everything that "comes up" and takes priority. These are your competing commitments.
- For each one, ask: "Is this genuinely more important, or does it just feel more urgent?"
  - More important -> Your action plan needs to account for this reality. Reduce the scope of your target action so it fits around the competing commitment.
  - More urgent but less important -> Create a pre-commitment: decide IN ADVANCE what you'll do when the competing commitment appears. Write it down: "When [urgent thing] comes up, I will [specific response] and then return to [my action] at [specific time]."
- **What you should see**: A realistic plan that accounts for your actual life, not a fantasy life with no interruptions.

**Step C5: The feedback desert.**
- You need artificial progress markers because natural feedback is too slow.
- Create a tracking system: a simple log, spreadsheet, or physical chart.
- Track INPUTS (actions taken) not OUTPUTS (results achieved). You control inputs; outputs are lagging indicators.
- Review your input log weekly. If inputs are consistent, results will come. If inputs aren't consistent, that's the real problem -- go to Step C2 and re-diagnose.
- **What you should see**: A visible record of effort that proves you're making progress even when results aren't visible yet.

**Step C6: The silent quit.**
- You stop without deciding to stop. The action just... fades.
- This usually means the action isn't connected to anything you actually care about.
- Ask: "If I never did this, what bad thing would actually happen?"
  - If you can't name a concrete consequence -> You might not need to do this. It may be a "should" imposed by someone else's values. Reconsider whether this action belongs on your list at all.
  - If you CAN name a consequence -> Make the consequence vivid and present. Write it on a card you see daily. The action fades because the consequence is abstract. Make it concrete.
- **What you should see**: Either a clear reason this action matters (which remotivates) or the realization that it doesn't (which frees you to drop it).

-> Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

### SECTION D: Displacement Activity -- "I'm busy but not on the right things"

**Step D1: List everything you did in the last 48 hours related to this goal.**
- Include planning, researching, organizing, discussing, and "preparing."
- **What you should see**: A list that's probably heavy on preparation and light on output.

**Step D2: Circle the items that produced a tangible artifact.**
- An artifact is something someone else could look at: a document, a prototype, a sent message, a completed form, a built thing.
- If everything else is planning/research/discussion -> **You are using preparation as a substitute for action.**
- **What you should see**: The honest ratio of preparation to production.

**Step D3: Identify the one action you're avoiding.**
- Look at your list. What's conspicuously absent? What would you be doing if you were making real progress?
- That absent action is the one you're displacing.
- Why are you avoiding it? Write down the honest answer.
  - "It's scary" -> Go to Section E, Step E3.
  - "It's boring" -> Go to Step D4.
  - "I don't know how" -> Go to Section B.
  - "It doesn't matter as much as these other things" -> Are you sure? If yes, change your goal. If no, see Step D4.

**Step D4: Make a rule: produce before you prepare.**
- Before any planning/research/organizing session, you must produce one artifact first.
- The artifact can be small (a single email, one paragraph, one prototype sketch).
- This inverts the displacement pattern: production first, then preparation as a reward.
- **What you should see**: Daily output of at least one artifact, even on low-motivation days.

-> Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

### SECTION E: Diagnosis -- "I don't know why I'm stuck"

**Step E1: The physical test.**
- Stand up. Walk to where you would do the action. Put your hands on the tools you'd use (keyboard, phone, pen, whatever).
- What happened?
  - "I started doing it" -> Your problem was activation energy. Go to Section A.
  - "I felt resistance in my body" (tension, avoidance, wanting to walk away) -> Continue to Step E2.
  - "I realized I don't actually know the next step" -> Go to Section B.

**Step E2: Name the competing commitment.**
- Complete this sentence: "I'm committed to [the action], but I'm also committed to ___."
- The blank is the competing commitment. Common ones:
  - "...not looking stupid"
  - "...keeping my options open"
  - "...not disrupting my current life"
  - "...being seen as competent"
  - "...avoiding conflict"
- **What you should see**: The hidden commitment that's actually running the show.

**Step E3: The emotional barrier.**
- Name the emotion: fear, shame, anxiety, dread, boredom, resentment.
- Now ask: "What's the worst thing that happens if I do this action and it goes badly?"
- Write down the worst case. Read it aloud.
- Now ask: "Could I survive that worst case?"
  - YES (which is almost always true) -> The fear is disproportionate to the actual risk. Acknowledge the fear, then do the action anyway. Fear + action = courage. Fear + inaction = stagnation.
  - NO (actual catastrophic risk) -> Your inaction might be justified. Reduce the risk: find a smaller first action that tests the waters without full exposure. Go to Section A, Step A1 with the reduced-risk version.
- **What you should see**: The actual risk stated clearly, which is almost always smaller than the imagined risk.

**Step E4: The identity check.**
- Complete this sentence: "The kind of person who does [this action] is ___."
- Is that description compatible with how you see yourself?
  - YES -> Your block isn't identity. Return to Step E1 and pick a different path.
  - NO -> You've found the core issue. You're not blocked by logistics, emotions, or knowledge. You're blocked because the action requires becoming someone you haven't decided to become yet.
  - **What to do**: You need to decide: are you willing to update your self-concept? If yes, start with the smallest action that the "new identity" person would take, and do it once. Identity follows behavior, not the other way around. One action doesn't make you that person. But it starts the shift.

-> Go to COMPLETION CHECK.

### COMPLETION CHECK

Answer these questions:

1. **Did you take at least one concrete action as a result of this procedure?**
   - YES -> The procedure worked. Repeat the triggering mechanism (Section A, Step A4) daily.
   - NO -> Which section did you end up in? Return to that section and identify what's still blocking you. If you've been through multiple sections without acting, the block is likely in Section E (emotional/identity) regardless of where you think it is.

2. **Is the action sustainable, or was it a one-time push?**
   - Sustainable (trigger exists, environment supports it, competing commitments managed) -> You're done.
   - One-time push -> Go to Section C to build sustainability.

3. **Are you doing the RIGHT action, or just AN action?**
   - Right action (connected to real goal, produces artifacts, passes the "does this actually matter" test) -> You're done.
   - Just busy -> Go to Section D.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: The 2-Minute Rule
If the next action takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to a list, don't schedule it, don't think about it. Just do it now. Most meaningful progress chains are made of 2-minute links.

### Card 2: The Motivation Myth
```
What people think: Motivation -> Action -> Results
What actually works: Tiny Action -> Small Result -> Motivation -> More Action -> More Results
```
Start before you're motivated. Motivation is a consequence of action, not a prerequisite.

### Card 3: The Five Blockers (in order of frequency)
1. **Unclear next step** (50% of all inaction) -> Make it concrete and tiny
2. **High activation energy** (20%) -> Reduce setup friction
3. **Competing commitment** (15%) -> Surface it, then choose
4. **Emotional barrier** (10%) -> Name it, do it anyway
5. **Identity conflict** (5%) -> Decide who you're becoming

### Card 4: The Displacement Detector
Ask: "Did I produce an artifact today, or did I only prepare to produce one?"
- Artifact = progress
- Preparation without artifact = probably displacement

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Treating this as another planning exercise.** If you read this entire procedure and don't take a physical action before putting it down, you've fallen into the meta-trap. The procedure only works if you DO the steps, not read about them.

2. **Starting at Section E when the problem is Section A.** Most inaction is caused by unclear or too-large next steps, not deep psychological blocks. Try the simplest explanation first.

3. **Blaming willpower.** "I just need more discipline" is almost never the right diagnosis. If you need willpower to do something daily, your environment is wrong or your action is too large.

4. **Skipping the trigger (Step A4).** Taking one action feels like success. But without a trigger, you won't take the action tomorrow. The trigger is where the procedure converts from a one-time intervention to a sustainable behavior.

5. **Assuming you need to fix yourself.** Sometimes the action is wrong, not you. If sustained effort through this procedure still yields no progress, revisit whether this is actually the right action.

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

- **When you genuinely need more information**: This procedure assumes the knowledge exists. If you truly don't know what to do (not "I'm uncertain" but "I have no information"), go learn first.
- **When rest is the right action**: Chronic inaction can be burnout, not blockage. If you're exhausted, the procedure is: rest, recover, then come back. Forcing action through exhaustion produces garbage output.
- **When the action requires other people's cooperation**: This procedure is for individual action. If your block is "I need my boss to approve this" or "I need my team to agree," you need a negotiation/influence procedure, not a personal action procedure.
- **When you're grieving, in crisis, or processing trauma**: Action-forcing procedures are inappropriate during acute emotional events. Handle the human need first.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: The Side Project Developer

**Situation**: Has learned React, has a project idea, has a design doc. Hasn't written a line of code in 6 weeks.
**Step 0**: "I know what to do but can't make myself do it." -> Section A.
- A1: "Write the app" -> "Set up the project" -> "Run create-react-app" -> "Open the terminal." Shrunken action: open the terminal.
- A2: Opens terminal. Done. -> A3.
- A3: Types `npx create-react-app my-project`. Done. Next: create the first component file. Does it. Next: write the component skeleton. Does it. 25 minutes pass.
- A4: Trigger: "After I close Slack at end of workday, I will open the terminal and write one component."

**Result**: The 6-week block was pure activation energy. Once started, momentum carried.

### Example 2: The Aspiring Author

**Situation**: Has an outline, has researched the topic thoroughly, has blocked "writing time" on the calendar for months. Spends writing time reorganizing notes instead.
**Step 0**: "I'm doing things but not the right things." -> Section D.
- D1: Last 48 hours: reorganized Notion workspace, read 3 articles "for research," color-coded the outline, discussed the book with a friend.
- D2: Artifacts produced: zero. No sentences written.
- D3: The avoided action: writing actual sentences. Why? "It's scary -- what if it's bad."
- -> Section E, Step E3: Worst case if the writing is bad? "I delete it and try again." Can I survive that? Obviously yes.
- Returns to Section A, Step A1: "Write one bad sentence. It doesn't have to be good."
- A2: Writes one sentence. Then another. Then a paragraph.
- D4: New rule: before opening Notion to organize, write 200 words first. Organizing is the reward.

**Result**: Displacement activity was a coping mechanism for fear of judgment. Making the first output explicitly "allowed to be bad" removed the barrier.

### Example 3: The Health-Conscious Non-Exerciser

**Situation**: Knows exercise is important. Has a gym membership. Has workout plans saved. Goes once, then stops for months. Repeat 5 times.
**Step 0**: "I keep starting but can't sustain it." -> Section C.
- C1: Started and stopped 5 times. Structural problem.
- C2: "I stop when something else comes up." -> Step C4.
- C4: Competing commitments: work deadlines, family dinners, social plans, fatigue. All feel "more important."
  - Are they genuinely more important? Work deadlines: sometimes. Family: sometimes. Social plans: rarely. Fatigue: usually not.
  - Pre-commitment: "When a work deadline competes with gym time, I will do a 15-minute home workout instead of skipping entirely. When I'm tired, I will go to the gym and do only 10 minutes -- I'm allowed to leave after 10 minutes."
- Creates trigger: "After I put on my shoes in the morning, I will put my gym bag by the door."

**Result**: The all-or-nothing framing ("full workout or nothing") was the structural problem. Permission to do a tiny version removed the competing commitment pressure.
