# Salary Negotiation

## Overview
Systematic approach to negotiating job offers that maximizes total compensation
while maintaining relationships and ensuring mutual satisfaction.

## Steps

### Step 1: Research market compensation
Gather data on what the role pays:

1. Salary databases:
   - levels.fyi (tech, very accurate)
   - Glassdoor (broad but sometimes outdated)
   - Payscale, Salary.com (traditional industries)
   - Blind (tech, anonymous data)
   - LinkedIn Salary Insights

2. Industry sources:
   - Professional association surveys
   - Recruiting firm salary guides
   - Job postings with salary ranges

3. Network intelligence:
   - Ask people in similar roles (carefully)
   - Recruiters can share ranges
   - Informational interviews

4. Adjust for factors:
   - Location (cost of living)
   - Company size and stage
   - Industry norms
   - Your experience level

Determine:
- Market range for role (25th, 50th, 75th percentile)
- Where you should fall in that range
- Total comp, not just base

### Step 2: Analyze the offer
Break down what they're offering:

1. Calculate total compensation:
   - Base salary
   - Signing bonus (if any)
   - Annual bonus (target × expected payout)
   - Equity (annual value, accounting for vesting)
   - Benefits value (especially if you can quantify)

2. Compare to market data:
   - Where does total comp fall in range?
   - Which components are above/below market?
   - What's the split (base heavy vs equity heavy)?

3. Identify negotiation opportunities:
   - Components below market
   - Areas with likely flexibility
   - Non-monetary items that matter to you

4. Assess your leverage:
   - How much do they want you specifically?
   - What's your BATNA worth?
   - Are there competing offers?
   - How urgent is their hiring need?

### Step 3: Define your targets
Set clear negotiation goals:

1. Determine your walk-away point:
   - Minimum acceptable total compensation
   - Must-have terms (non-negotiable)
   - Based on BATNA value

2. Set your target:
   - Best realistic outcome
   - Justified by market data
   - Accounts for your experience and leverage

3. Set your opening ask:
   - Ambitious but defensible
   - Usually 10-20% above their offer
   - Or at 75th percentile of market range

4. Plan your negotiation priorities:
   - Most important component to improve
   - Secondary asks
   - Nice-to-haves you can concede

Remember:
- Don't anchor too high (seem unreasonable)
- Don't anchor too low (leave money on table)
- Have justification ready for your number

### Step 4: Plan your approach
Develop negotiation strategy:

1. Timing:
   - Express enthusiasm first, then negotiate
   - Get full offer details before countering
   - Don't rush; take time to consider
   - Typical timeline: 2-7 days to respond

2. Communication channel:
   - Phone/video for discussion, email for confirmation
   - Write your points in advance
   - Practice delivery

3. Frame positively:
   - Express genuine enthusiasm
   - Position as collaborative problem-solving
   - Use "we" language ("how can we get to X?")

4. Script your key points:
   - Opening: Thanks and enthusiasm
   - Ask: Specific number with brief justification
   - Handle pushback: Prepared responses
   - Alternative asks: If base is capped

5. Prepare for their moves:
   - "This is our best offer" -> ask about non-base items
   - "Budget is fixed" -> ask about signing bonus or early review
   - "Take it or leave it" -> ask for time, test if real

### Step 5: Execute negotiation
Have the negotiation conversation:

1. Opening:
   "Thank you so much for the offer. I'm really excited about
   this opportunity and [specific reason]. I've had a chance to
   review the details and would like to discuss the compensation."

2. Make your ask:
   "Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I was hoping
   we could get to $X for the base salary. I'm seeing similar
   roles in the $X-Y range, and given [your specific value], I
   believe this is fair."

3. Listen and respond:
   - If yes: Express thanks, confirm in writing
   - If counter: Consider, don't immediately accept
   - If no: Explore alternatives

4. Explore alternatives if base capped:
   "I understand there may be constraints on base. Are there
   other ways to bridge the gap? Perhaps a signing bonus,
   additional equity, or accelerated review timeline?"

5. Never accept verbally on the spot:
   "Thank you. I'd like a day to review the full package and
   discuss with my family. Can we connect tomorrow?"

Red lines:
- Don't lie about other offers
- Don't make ultimatums you won't keep
- Don't be aggressive or entitled
- Don't negotiate forever (1-2 rounds is typical)

### Step 6: Close and document
Finalize the agreement properly:

1. Get it in writing:
   - Request updated offer letter with all negotiated terms
   - Review every number and term carefully
   - Confirm start date, title, reporting structure
   - Check for anything missing or different

2. Before accepting:
   - Compare final offer to your walk-away point
   - Consider non-monetary factors (growth, culture, work)
   - Trust your gut on overall fit

3. Accept professionally:
   - Written acceptance
   - Express enthusiasm
   - Confirm next steps

4. Handle declined offers:
   - Thank them professionally
   - Keep door open for future
   - You may cross paths again

5. Wrap up:
   - Give proper notice at current job
   - Don't burn bridges
   - Prepare for new role
