# Detection Verification Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

When investigating potential deception or anomalies, the order of investigation matters. Check the hardest-to-fake evidence first, establish baselines before looking for deviations, and verify independently before confronting.

## Core Principle

Liars optimize for the most obvious checks. Your ordering should prioritize what's hardest to fake, most independent, and least expected.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Hardest to Fake First
- Check evidence that would be most difficult to fabricate or manipulate
- Physical evidence before testimony, data before narrative, timestamps before content
- **Why**: if the hardest-to-fake evidence is clean, softer evidence is more trustworthy

### Rule 2: Baseline Before Deviation
- Establish what normal looks like before looking for abnormal
- Compare against historical patterns, peer behavior, expected distributions
- **Why**: you can't detect anomalies without knowing what normal is

### Rule 3: Independent Sources Before Correlated
- Check independently generated evidence before checking sources that could have been coordinated
- **Why**: correlated sources could tell a consistent false story

### Rule 4: Periphery Before Center
- Check surrounding evidence before the main claim
- Verify context, metadata, and secondary details
- **Why**: deception focuses on the main story; peripheral details are more likely to be authentic or reveal inconsistencies

### Rule 5: Pattern Before Instance
- Look for systematic patterns before investigating individual cases
- Statistical anomalies across many instances are harder to explain away than single events
- **Why**: one anomaly might be coincidence; a pattern is signal

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Define What You're Checking
- What is the claim or behavior under investigation?
- What would deception/fraud look like?
- What would innocence look like?

### Step 2: Identify Evidence Types
- Physical / digital / testimonial / statistical
- Rank by difficulty to fake
- Identify which are independent vs correlated

### Step 3: Execute in Order
1. Check hardest-to-fake evidence
2. Establish baseline patterns
3. Check independent sources
4. Look at peripheral details
5. Examine statistical patterns
6. Only then: confront or conclude

## Anti-Patterns
- Starting with confrontation (tips off deceiver)
- Relying on testimony alone (easiest to fake)
- Checking only the main claim (missing peripheral inconsistencies)
- Confirmation bias (looking for guilt, ignoring innocence evidence)

## When to Use
- Fraud investigation
- Due diligence
- Fact-checking claims
- Security audits
- Any situation where trust needs verification

## Verification
- [ ] Evidence ranked by difficulty to fake
- [ ] Baseline established
- [ ] Independent sources checked before correlated
- [ ] Peripheral evidence examined
- [ ] Both deception and innocence hypotheses considered
