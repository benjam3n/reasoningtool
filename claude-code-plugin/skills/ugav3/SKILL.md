# Universal Goal Analysis Framework v3

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The comprehensive question framework v3. All unclear terminology replaced with literal definitions. Complex questions decomposed into sub-procedures. All questions pass: "Does answering this yield a fact that determines what to do?" Infrastructure elevated to full category. Stakeholder analysis restructured. No questions that allow interpretation variance between rational people.

## Steps

### Step 1: GOAL DEFINITION (Decomposed)
1. State the goal in one sentence with a verb, object, and metric
2. What is the metric? What unit? What current value? What target value?
3. By what date must the target be reached?
4. Who judges whether the goal is met? What evidence do they accept?
5. If two people evaluated this goal independently, would they agree on whether it's met? If not, refine until they would.

### Step 2: STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS (Restructured)
For each person affected by this goal:

| Person | What they want | What they control | Their current action | What would change their action |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| [name] | [specific want] | [specific resource/decision] | [what they're doing now] | [what event/info changes it] |

Key question: For each stakeholder, does achieving your goal HELP or HURT their goals?
- If helps: they're a natural ally — make it visible
- If hurts: they're a natural obstacle — plan for resistance
- If neutral: don't spend energy on them

### Step 3: INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
3a. **Physical infrastructure:**
- What tools/equipment/space is needed?
- Is it available now? If not, how to get it? (Cost, timeline)

3b. **Knowledge infrastructure:**
- What do you need to know that you don't? (List specific unknowns)
- Where is each piece of information? (Source, not "research")
- How long to acquire each piece?

3c. **Process infrastructure:**
- What recurring actions are needed? (Daily/weekly habits)
- What systems track progress? (Not "I'll remember" — actual system)
- What decision rules handle common situations? (So you don't re-decide)

3d. **Social infrastructure:**
- Who needs to be involved? In what capacity?
- What agreements are needed? (Not "support" — specific commitments)
- What communication cadence keeps everyone aligned?

### Step 4: DECISION-MAKER ANALYSIS (Fully Decomposed)
If someone else makes a key decision:
1. Who specifically makes the decision? (Name, not title)
2. What criteria do they use? (Observed criteria, not stated criteria)
3. What information do they need to decide? In what format?
4. When is the decision made? (Date/trigger)
5. Who influences them? Through what channel?
6. What have they decided in similar past situations?
7. What is their default action if no one intervenes? (This is the baseline to beat)

### Step 5: EXECUTION PLAN
1. List every action required, in order of dependency
2. For each action:
   - Input: what's needed to start
   - Output: what's produced when done
   - Duration: how long
   - Owner: who does it
   - Verification: how to confirm it's done correctly
3. What is the critical path? (Longest chain of dependent actions)
4. What can be done in parallel?
5. Where are the bottlenecks?

### Step 6: MONITORING
1. What three numbers would you check weekly?
   - Leading indicator: [predicts future outcome]
   - Activity indicator: [measures effort]
   - Outcome indicator: [measures result]
2. For each number: what range is "on track"? What range triggers action?
3. What is the review cadence and who reviews?

### Step 7: Report
```
GOAL ANALYSIS v3:
Goal: [one sentence with verb, object, metric, deadline]
Metric: [unit] | Current: [N] | Target: [N] | By: [date]

Stakeholders: [N allies, N obstacles, N neutral]
Infrastructure gaps: [what's missing]
Key decision-maker: [who, when they decide, what they need]

Critical path: [longest dependency chain]
Bottleneck: [slowest/hardest step]

Weekly metrics:
1. [leading indicator]
2. [activity indicator]
3. [outcome indicator]
```

## When to Use
- Any new goal (more rigorous than v2)
- Goals requiring coordination with others
- Goals where execution discipline matters
- → See also: /ugav2 (simpler), /ugav4, /ugav5 (more categories)

## Verification
- [ ] Goal passes two-person agreement test
- [ ] Stakeholders analyzed for alignment/opposition
- [ ] Infrastructure decomposed into physical, knowledge, process, social
- [ ] Decision-makers analyzed with observed (not stated) criteria
- [ ] Execution plan has dependencies, owners, and verification
- [ ] Monitoring has specific numbers and action triggers
