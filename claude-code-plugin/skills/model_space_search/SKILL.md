# Model Space Search

## Overview
Understanding = finding a model that fits.
Instead of settling on first model that seems plausible:
1. Generate multiple competing models
2. Score each against fit criteria
3. Select the model with best support

This prevents premature closure on a suboptimal model.

## Goal
Generate multiple possible models/explanations for a phenomenon,
then search for the one that best fits the evidence.

## Steps

### Step 1: Describe the Phenomenon
Clearly state what you're trying to model.
What patterns, behaviors, or outcomes need explaining?

**Output**: Phenomenon description

### Step 2: List Observations
Document all relevant observations/data.
These are what models must account for.

**Output**: Observation list

### Step 3: Generate Null Model
What's the simplest explanation?
This is the baseline to beat.

**Output**: Null model

### Step 4: Generate Causal Models
For each plausible cause, build a model.
State cause, mechanism, predictions.

**Output**: Causal models

### Step 5: Generate Mechanistic Models
What mechanisms could produce the observations?
Build models around different mechanisms.

**Output**: Mechanistic models

### Step 6: Generate Analogical Models
What similar phenomena have known models?
Import and adapt.

**Output**: Analogical models

### Step 7: Compile Model List
List all generated models.
State each clearly with:
- Core claim
- Mechanism
- Key predictions
- Required assumptions

**Output**: Master model list

### Step 8: Score Each Model
For each model, score on criteria:
- Explains observations
- No contradictions
- Predictive accuracy
- Simplicity
- Generalizability
- Coherence
- Mechanism clarity

**Output**: Scored models

### Step 9: Compare Models
Create comparison table.
Identify which model wins on which criteria.
Look for dominant model (wins on most).

**Output**: Model comparison

### Step 10: Select Best Model
Select model with highest score.
Note:
- Confidence (how much better than alternatives?)
- What would change the selection?
- What further evidence would help?

**Output**: Selected model

### Step 11: State Implications
If this model is correct:
- What else should be true?
- What should we expect to see?
- What actions does this suggest?

**Output**: Model implications


## When to Use
- Trying to understand a phenomenon
- Multiple explanations seem plausible
- Need to choose between theories
- Building mental models
- Scientific/analytical inquiry

## Verification
- Multiple models were generated (not just favorite)
- Null model was included as baseline
- Models are clearly stated with mechanisms
- Scoring was consistent across models
- Best model accounts for anomalies
- Implications and next steps identified
