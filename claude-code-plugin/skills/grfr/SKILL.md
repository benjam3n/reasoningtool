# Goal Reframing Procedure

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Transform "impossible" or problematic goals into achievable versions.

CORE PHILOSOPHY: There is no such thing as an impossible goal.
There is only insufficient decomposition or incorrect framing.

"Impossible" usually means one of:
- We haven't thought deeply enough about what's actually required
- We're using the wrong frame (literal vs metaphorical)
- We haven't found the achievable version that captures the intent
- We said airplanes would take a million years in 1900

"Unethical" goals can almost always be achieved ethically:
- The underlying need is usually legitimate
- Only the METHOD was problematic
- Reframe to achieve the same outcome through ethical means

## CRITICAL: Reframing vs Substitution

**Reframing IS a form of goal change.** This skill explicitly handles substitution.

### Step 0: Capture Original and Get Consent

```
ORIGINAL GOAL (verbatim): "[user's exact words]"
```

**Acknowledge upfront**: "I'm going to propose a REFRAME of your goal. This means
suggesting a different way to think about what you want. The reframed version may
be a different goal that achieves what matters to you."

### Reframing Types

| Type | What It Does | Consent Level |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Scope Preservation** | Same goal, different approach | Low (clarification-like) |
| **Intent Preservation** | Different goal, same underlying value | Medium (explain difference) |
| **Value Discovery** | Different goal based on discovered values | High (explicit consent) |
| **Complete Pivot** | Different goal, different value | Highest (may be rejection) |

### Consent Template for Reframes

```
REFRAME PROPOSAL
================
Your original goal: "[original]"

I'm proposing a reframe: "[reframed goal]"

This is a [SCOPE/INTENT/VALUE/PIVOT] reframe:
- What's preserved: [what stays the same]
- What changes: [what's different]
- Why I think it helps: [reasoning]

If you achieved the reframed goal but NOT the original, would that be:
[ ] Acceptable (the reframe captures what matters)
[ ] Not acceptable (I still want the original)
[ ] I need to think about it

Your choice?
```

## When to Use
- Goal seems "impossible"
- Goal seems unethical or harmful
- Goal is too vague to act on
- Goal is expressed as outcome beyond control
- System is tempted to reject or give up

---

## Context-Adaptive Variants

### Reframe-Lite (URGENT)
**Steps**:
1. Capture original
2. One quick reframe attempt
3. If blocked, acknowledge and move on

### Reframe-Standard
**Steps**: Full procedure with consent check

### Reframe-Full (HIGH stakes)
**Steps**: Full procedure + multiple reframe options + user selects

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand Why Goal Seems Impossible
- What specific obstacle makes it "impossible"?
- Is it physically impossible, or just very hard?
- Is it impossible as stated, or as interpreted?

### Step 2: Identify the Underlying Value
- What would achieving this goal give you?
- What's the deeper need being served?
- → INVOKE: /value_elicitation if unclear

### Step 3: Generate Reframe Options
Generate multiple reframes at different levels:

1. **Scope Preservation Reframe**: Same goal, remove unnecessary constraints
2. **Intent Preservation Reframe**: Different goal, same underlying value
3. **Value Discovery Reframe**: Different goal based on what we learned matters
4. **Literal vs Metaphorical**: Is the goal meant literally or as an expression?

### Step 4: Present Options with Honest Assessment

For each reframe:
- What it achieves
- What it doesn't achieve
- How it relates to original

### Step 5: Get Explicit Choice

User selects:
- One of the reframes
- Original goal anyway (with acknowledgment of difficulty)
- Something else (iterate)

---

## Verification
- [ ] Original goal captured verbatim
- [ ] Reframe type identified
- [ ] User consent obtained for non-trivial reframes
- [ ] User understands what's preserved and what's lost
- [ ] If honest rejection, reason is factual and specific

## Niche Documentation

### Where This Skill Works Best
- Goals that seem impossible but have achievable variants
- Goals where underlying value is different from stated goal
- Situations where user is stuck on one framing

### Where This Skill Struggles
- Goals that are genuinely impossible (use honest rejection)
- Goals where user doesn't want alternatives
- Time-critical situations (use Reframe-Lite)

### Integration
- Often invoked from: /goal_understanding, /goal_refinement
- Routes to: /goal_decomposition, /steps_generation
- Gate: clarification_vs_substitution (but this skill is explicitly about substitution)
