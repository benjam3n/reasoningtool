# Habit Formation

## Overview
Build new habits and break unwanted ones using behavioral science principles

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the habit clearly
Specify exactly what behavior you want to establish or eliminate:
1. State the specific behavior (not vague like "be healthier")
2. Identify if building new habit or breaking existing one
3. Connect to underlying motivation and values
4. Determine desired frequency (daily, weekly, situational)
5. Define what "done" looks like

### Step 2: Design the habit using four laws
Apply habit science to design for success:

FOR BUILDING:
- Cue (Make it obvious): Where and when? What will trigger it?
- Craving (Make it attractive): How to make it appealing?
- Response (Make it easy): What's the 2-minute version?
- Reward (Make it satisfying): What immediate reward?

FOR BREAKING:
- Cue (Make it invisible): How to hide/remove triggers?
- Craving (Make it unattractive): How to reframe the appeal?
- Response (Make it difficult): What friction can be added?
- Reward (Make it unsatisfying): What immediate cost?

### Step 3: Prepare the environment
Modify physical and digital environment for success:
1. Identify environmental cues that support or hinder the habit
2. Design visibility changes (what to see/hide)
3. Reduce/add steps to the behavior
4. Set up tools and resources in advance
5. Consider social environment (who supports/undermines)

FOR BUILDING:
- Make cues visible and obvious
- Remove obstacles between you and the behavior
- Prepare everything needed in advance

FOR BREAKING:
- Remove or hide cues
- Add obstacles between you and the behavior
- Remove enabling tools/substances

### Step 4: Start with the two-minute version
Begin with the smallest viable version:
1. Identify the gateway habit (2 minutes or less)
2. Focus on showing up, not performance
3. Make it impossible to fail
4. Build the identity before the behavior
5. Protect the streak at all costs

Examples:
- "Exercise daily" → "Put on workout clothes"
- "Read more" → "Read one page"
- "Meditate" → "Sit in meditation position for 60 seconds"

### Step 5: Set up tracking system
Implement habit tracking for accountability:
1. Choose tracking method (calendar, app, journal)
2. Define what counts as completion
3. Establish tracking ritual (when to mark complete)
4. Make tracking visible
5. Plan for missed days (never miss twice)

### Step 6: Establish accountability
Create accountability mechanisms:
1. Identify accountability type (self, social, financial)
2. Find accountability partner or group if using social
3. Define check-in frequency and format
4. Establish consequences for missing (if helpful)
5. Create commitment device if needed

Options:
- Self: Public commitment, written contract with self
- Social: Accountability partner, group, public updates
- Financial: Commitment contract, bet, stake money

### Step 7: Execute and monitor
Run the habit with monitoring:
1. Execute the two-minute version consistently
2. Track completion daily
3. Review weekly (what's working, what isn't)
4. Apply "never miss twice" rule
5. Identify and address obstacles
6. Gradually scale up when ready (not before)


## When to Use
- Building a new daily or recurring behavior
- Breaking an unwanted automatic behavior
- Improving daily routines and productivity
- Supporting goal achievement through consistent actions
- Creating sustainable lifestyle changes
- Establishing professional routines (morning routine, review habits)
- Stacking new behaviors onto existing ones
- Recovering from habit lapses or fresh starts

## Verification
- Habit is specifically defined with clear completion criteria
- Implementation intention specifies when, where, and what
- Two-minute gateway version identified and used initially
- Environment is designed to support the habit
- Tracking system is in place and being used
- Accountability mechanism matches the person and stakes
- Never miss twice rule is understood and applied
