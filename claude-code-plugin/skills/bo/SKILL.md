## Overview

Comprehensive procedure for business goals including starting, growing, and operating businesses. Covers the gaps in the thin business domain.

Most business advice is generic. This procedure provides frameworks for the actual hard decisions.

## Steps

### Step 1: Classify the Business Question
What type of business challenge is the input?

| Type | Route to | Key Question |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Starting a business | Step 2a | Is this viable? |
| Revenue/sales | Step 2b | How to get customers? |
| Pricing | Step 2c | What to charge? |
| Hiring/team | Step 2d | Who to hire and when? |
| Growth | Step 2e | How to scale? |
| Operations | Step 2f | How to run efficiently? |
| Financial | Step 2g | How to manage money? |

### Step 2a: Starting — Viability Assessment
Before building anything:
1. **Problem**: What specific problem does this solve? For whom?
2. **Evidence**: How do you KNOW this is a real problem? (Not assumed — validated)
3. **Solution**: Why is YOUR solution better than alternatives?
4. **Market**: How many people have this problem and would pay to solve it?
5. **Economics**: Can you deliver the solution profitably?
6. **Moat**: What prevents a competitor from copying you?
- → INVOKE: /cd (customer development) for problem validation

### Step 2b: Revenue — Customer Acquisition
1. **Who** is the ideal customer? (Specific, not "everyone")
2. **Where** are they? (Physical/digital channels)
3. **What** message resonates? (Problem → solution → proof)
4. **How** do they buy? (Sales process, decision factors)
5. **Cost**: What does it cost to acquire one customer?
6. **Value**: What is one customer worth over their lifetime?
7. Rule: Customer Lifetime Value must be > 3× Customer Acquisition Cost

### Step 2c: Pricing
1. **Cost-plus**: What does it cost to deliver + target margin?
2. **Value-based**: What is the customer's alternative? Price below that.
3. **Competitive**: What do similar solutions cost?
4. **Test**: Try different prices and measure conversion × revenue
5. Common mistake: pricing too LOW (signals low quality, attracts wrong customers)

### Step 2d: Hiring
1. **When to hire**: Only when the work exceeds what current people can do AND the hire will generate more revenue than their cost
2. **Who first**: Hire for your weakest critical function (not your favorite)
3. **How to evaluate**: Past results in similar context > credentials > interviews
4. **Common mistake**: Hiring before product-market fit is confirmed

### Step 2e: Growth
1. **Organic**: Content, SEO, word of mouth, community
2. **Paid**: Advertising, partnerships, affiliate programs
3. **Product-led**: Free tier, viral features, network effects
4. **Sales-led**: Direct sales team, outbound, enterprise
5. Choose based on: Customer Acquisition Cost ceiling, product complexity, deal size

### Step 2f: Operations
1. **Systematize**: Document processes so they're repeatable without you
2. **Measure**: Track the 3-5 metrics that actually matter (not vanity metrics)
3. **Automate**: Remove humans from processes that don't need judgment
4. **Delegate**: Give others authority to make decisions in their domain
5. Key metric: Revenue per employee (simplest measure of operational efficiency)

### Step 2g: Financial Management
1. **Cash flow**: Revenue timing vs expense timing (this kills businesses, not profitability)
2. **Unit economics**: Revenue per customer - cost per customer = margin per customer
3. **Runway**: Cash ÷ monthly burn = months until broke
4. **Break-even**: Fixed costs ÷ margin per unit = units to break even
5. → INVOKE: /bm (budget management) for detailed financial planning
6. → INVOKE: /cfm (cash flow management) for cash flow optimization

### Step 3: Apply Framework to Input
1. Classify the input (Step 1)
2. Apply the relevant sub-step
3. Identify the key decision or action needed
4. Check: is the advice specific enough to act on? If not, ask for more context

### Step 4: Report
```
