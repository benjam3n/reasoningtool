# Multi-Party and Institutional Goals Handler

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Handler for goals that require navigating institutions, groups, politics, and multiple stakeholders with different interests. These goals can't be achieved through individual action alone. They require coalition building, persuasion, negotiation, and understanding power dynamics.

## Steps

### Step 1: Map the Decision Landscape
1. What decision needs to be made?
2. Who makes the decision? (The actual decision-maker, not just who should)
3. What is the formal process? (Vote, consensus, executive decision, committee)
4. What is the informal process? (Who really influences what?)

### Step 2: Stakeholder Analysis
For each relevant stakeholder:

| Stakeholder | Interest | Position | Power | Influence | Movability |
|------------|---------|----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| [who] | [what they want] | [for/against/neutral] | [H/M/L] | [who they influence] | [H/M/L] |

**Position categories:**
- Champion: Actively supports your goal
- Supporter: Agrees but won't actively push
- Neutral: No strong position
- Skeptic: Has concerns but persuadable
- Opponent: Actively opposes
- Blocker: Has veto power and uses it

### Step 3: Understand Each Stakeholder's World
For each key stakeholder:
1. What do they care about MOST? (Not what you think they should care about)
2. What are they afraid of?
3. What would make this a WIN for them?
4. What have they said publicly vs privately?
5. Who do THEY listen to?
6. What is their decision-making style? (Data, relationships, authority, consensus)

### Step 4: Build Your Coalition
**Coalition strategy:**
1. Start with champions (easy wins, build momentum)
2. Move supporters to champions (ask for specific actions)
3. Convert neutrals to supporters (show what's in it for them)
4. Address skeptic concerns (listen, then adjust)
5. Isolate or co-opt opponents (don't waste energy converting true opponents)
6. Navigate around or negotiate with blockers

**For each coalition member:**
| Person | Current Position | Target Position | What They Need | Your Ask |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| [name] | [current] | [desired] | [what moves them] | [specific request] |

### Step 5: Craft Messages
Different stakeholders need different messages:

| Stakeholder Type | Message Focus | Frame |
|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Data-driven | Evidence, ROI, metrics | "The numbers show..." |
| Relationship-driven | Trust, testimonials, consensus | "People we respect are doing..." |
| Authority-driven | Precedent, hierarchy, mandate | "Leadership has indicated..." |
| Risk-averse | Safety, reversibility, pilot | "Low risk way to test..." |
| Innovation-driven | Novelty, competitive advantage | "First-mover opportunity..." |

**One message per stakeholder, tailored to what they care about.**

### Step 6: Navigate the Process
1. **Timing**: When is the best moment to push? (Budget cycles, leadership changes, crises)
2. **Sequencing**: Who to approach first? (Build support before approaching opponents)
3. **Forums**: Where to have key conversations? (Formal meetings vs 1-on-1 vs informal)
4. **Framing**: How to present it? (As continuation vs change, as their idea vs yours)
5. **Fallback**: If blocked, what's plan B?

### Step 7: Handle Opposition
When stakeholders oppose:
1. **Listen first**: Understand their REAL concern (not their stated one)
2. **Find common ground**: What do you AGREE on?
3. **Address concerns**: Can you modify your proposal to address legitimate concerns?
4. **Trade**: What can you offer them in exchange for support?
5. **Escalate**: If needed, go to someone with more authority (use sparingly)
6. **Wait**: Sometimes timing is the issue — try again later with more support

### Step 8: Report
```
MULTI-PARTY GOAL ANALYSIS:
Goal: [what needs to happen]
Decision-maker: [who ultimately decides]
Decision process: [how the decision is made]

Stakeholder map:
| Stakeholder | Position | Power | Strategy |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| [name] | [for/against/neutral] | [H/M/L] | [approach] |

Coalition status:
Champions: [N] | Supporters: [N] | Neutral: [N] | Skeptics: [N] | Opponents: [N]

Strategy:
1. [first move — who, what, when]
2. [second move]
3. [third move]

Key risk: [biggest obstacle]
Fallback: [if primary approach fails]
```

## When to Use
- Goal requires decisions from groups/committees
- Multiple stakeholders with different interests
- Institutional or organizational change
- Need to build coalitions
- → INVOKE: /skm (stakeholder management) for deeper stakeholder analysis
- → INVOKE: /neg (negotiation) for negotiation preparation
- → INVOKE: /orc (orchestration) for multi-channel influence

## Verification
- [ ] Decision landscape mapped (who decides, how)
- [ ] All stakeholders identified with positions and power
- [ ] Stakeholder motivations understood (not assumed)
- [ ] Coalition building strategy with specific asks
- [ ] Messages tailored to each stakeholder type
- [ ] Fallback plan if primary approach fails
