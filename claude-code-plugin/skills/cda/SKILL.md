# Cross-Domain Analogy

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Find **analogous situations in other domains** to:
- Import proven solutions from elsewhere
- See your problem from fresh perspectives
- Discover patterns that transcend domains
- Generate truly novel approaches

**Why cross-domain works**:
- Most problems have been solved somewhere else
- Novel insights often come from unexpected connections
- Domain experts suffer from "curse of knowledge"—outsider perspectives help

## The Analogy Process

### Step 1: Abstract the Problem

Strip away domain-specific details to find the core pattern:

```
PROBLEM ABSTRACTION:

Original problem: [specific problem statement]

Core pattern (domain-neutral):
- What is the STRUCTURE? [relationship between elements]
- What is the DYNAMIC? [how things change/interact]
- What is the GOAL? [desired end state]
- What is the CONSTRAINT? [what limits solutions]

ABSTRACTED PROBLEM:
"[Generic description without domain terms]"

Example:
Original: "Our sales team isn't hitting targets"
Abstracted: "A group's collective output is below the threshold needed"
```

---

### Step 2: Search for Analogous Domains

For the abstracted problem, scan domains:

```
ANALOGY SEARCH:

Abstracted problem: [from Step 1]

| Domain | Analogous Situation | Similarity Score |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Biology | [situation in biology] | [1-10] |
| Military | [situation in military] | [1-10] |
| Sports | [situation in sports] | [1-10] |
| Medicine | [situation in medicine] | [1-10] |
| Economics | [situation in economics] | [1-10] |
| Architecture | [situation in architecture] | [1-10] |
...

TOP 3 ANALOGIES (highest similarity):
1. [Domain]: [situation] - Score: [X]
2. [Domain]: [situation] - Score: [X]
3. [Domain]: [situation] - Score: [X]
```

---

### Step 3: Deep Dive on Top Analogies

For each top analogy:

```
ANALOGY DEEP DIVE: [Domain] - [Situation]
===================================================

THE ANALOGY:
Your problem: [original problem]
Analogous to: [situation in other domain]

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
| Your Domain | -> | Analogous Domain |
|-------------|---|------------------|
| [Element A] | -> | [Element A'] |
| [Element B] | -> | [Element B'] |
| [Process X] | -> | [Process X'] |
| [Goal Y] | -> | [Goal Y'] |
| [Constraint Z] | -> | [Constraint Z'] |

HOW THEY SOLVE IT IN [DOMAIN]:
1. [Solution approach 1]
2. [Solution approach 2]
3. [Solution approach 3]

WHY IT WORKS THERE:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

WHAT WE CAN IMPORT:
- [Transferable insight 1]
- [Transferable insight 2]

WHAT DOESN'T TRANSFER:
- [Non-transferable element]: Because [reason]

ADAPTATION NEEDED:
- [How to adapt the solution to your domain]

===================================================
```

---

### Step 4: Cross-Pollinate Insights

Combine insights from multiple analogies:

```
CROSS-POLLINATION:

Insight from [Domain 1]: [insight]
Insight from [Domain 2]: [insight]
Insight from [Domain 3]: [insight]

COMBINED INSIGHT:
[What emerges from combining these perspectives]

NOVEL APPROACH:
[New solution that wouldn't come from any single domain]
```

---

### Step 5: Validate the Analogy

Check that the analogy isn't misleading:

```
ANALOGY VALIDATION:

Analogy: [your domain] is like [other domain]

SIMILARITIES (analogy holds):
[x] [Structural similarity 1]
[x] [Dynamic similarity 2]
[x] [Constraint similarity 3]

DIFFERENCES (analogy breaks):
[!] [Key difference 1] - Impact: [how this affects applicability]
[!] [Key difference 2] - Impact: [how this affects applicability]

ANALOGY STRENGTH: [Strong / Moderate / Weak / Misleading]

SAFE TO IMPORT:
- [Insight that transfers despite differences]

DANGEROUS TO IMPORT:
- [Insight that seems relevant but breaks due to differences]
```

---

### Step 6: Generate Analogy-Informed Solutions

```
===================================================
CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHT SYNTHESIS: [topic]
===================================================

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
[Problem statement]

ANALOGIES EXPLORED:
1. [Domain 1]: [situation]
2. [Domain 2]: [situation]
3. [Domain 3]: [situation]

===================================================

KEY INSIGHTS IMPORTED:

From [Domain 1]:
- [Insight] -> Applied to your domain: [application]

From [Domain 2]:
- [Insight] -> Applied to your domain: [application]

From [Domain 3]:
- [Insight] -> Applied to your domain: [application]

===================================================

NOVEL SOLUTIONS (analogy-informed):

1. [Solution 1]
   Source analogy: [domain]
   How it applies: [explanation]
   Adaptation needed: [what to change]

2. [Solution 2]
   Source analogy: [domain]
   How it applies: [explanation]
   Adaptation needed: [what to change]

3. [Solution 3] (cross-pollinated)
   Source analogies: [domain 1] + [domain 2]
   How it applies: [explanation]
   Adaptation needed: [what to change]

===================================================

REFRAMED UNDERSTANDING:

Before analogies: [how you saw the problem]
After analogies: [new way of seeing it]

What changed: [key shift in understanding]

===================================================
```

## Quick Analogy (Abbreviated)

For fast cross-domain insight:

```
QUICK ANALOGY: [problem]

Core pattern: [abstracted problem]

Best analogy: [domain] - [situation]

They solve it by: [approach]

We could try: [imported solution]

Key difference to watch: [what might not transfer]
```

---

## Example: "How do we onboard new employees faster?"

### Step 1: Abstract
- Core pattern: "Integrating new elements into a functioning system quickly"
- Goal: Rapid integration without disrupting system
- Constraint: New elements lack system-specific knowledge

### Step 2: Search Analogies

| Domain | Situation | Score |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Biology | Organ transplant acceptance | 8 |
| Military | Integrating new recruits into unit | 9 |
| Sports | Trading deadline acquisitions | 8 |
| Cooking | Adding ingredients mid-recipe | 6 |
| Music | New musician joining established band | 9 |

### Step 3: Deep Dive - Military

```
ANALOGY: Military unit integration

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
| Company | -> | Military |
|---------|---|----------|
| New hire | -> | New recruit |
| Team | -> | Squad/unit |
| Company culture | -> | Unit traditions |
| Skills needed | -> | Combat readiness |
| Manager | -> | Squad leader |

HOW MILITARY SOLVES IT:
1. Battle buddy system (pair with experienced soldier)
2. Immediate real responsibilities (not just observation)
3. Unit history and tradition education
4. Physical integration (same quarters, meals)
5. Graduated challenge increase

WHAT WE CAN IMPORT:
- Buddy system -> Onboarding buddy
- Immediate contribution -> Day-1 tasks
- Culture immersion -> Company story sessions
- Physical proximity -> Desk placement strategy
```

### Step 4: Cross-Pollinate

```
From Military: Buddy system + immediate real work
From Music: Learn the "songbook" (standard repertoire)
From Sports: Film study (watch how team operates)

COMBINED:
- Pair with buddy
- Contribute immediately to real work
- Study recorded meetings/decisions
- Learn the "greatest hits" (key past projects)
```

### Step 5: Validate

```
Military analogy breaks because:
- Company can't demand 24/7 immersion
- Lower stakes = less urgency
- More role specialization

Safe to import: Buddy system, immediate contribution
Risky: Expecting military-level commitment
```

## Analogy Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Surface similarity** | Looks similar but different dynamics | "Users are like fish" (shallow) |
| **Forced mapping** | Stretching analogy too far | Mapping every element when few transfer |
| **Authority borrowing** | Using prestigious domain for credibility | "It's like Navy SEALs" for everything |
| **Single-domain fixation** | Only looking at one analogous domain | Only military analogies for business |
