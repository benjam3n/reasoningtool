# Motivation Psychology Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Optimal ordering for human executors differs from optimal ordering for machines. Humans have energy cycles, need motivation, lose focus, and are affected by sequence effects. These orderings account for psychology to maximize sustained output.

## Core Principle

Sequence work to build and maintain momentum. Humans perform best when tasks match their current energy level and each completed task fuels motivation for the next.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Quick Win First
- Start with a small, completable task that generates visible progress
- Completion triggers dopamine, building momentum for harder tasks
- **When**: starting a project, returning after a break, low motivation

### Rule 2: Hard Task at Peak Energy
- Schedule the most cognitively demanding work during peak energy hours
- For most people: first 2-4 hours of the work day
- Save routine/administrative work for low-energy periods
- **When**: tasks vary in difficulty, energy is limited

### Rule 3: Alternate Difficulty
- Don't stack all hard tasks together (burnout) or all easy tasks (boredom)
- Alternate: hard → easy → hard → easy
- **When**: long work sessions, mixed task difficulty

### Rule 4: Commitment Escalation
- Start with small commitments, increase gradually
- "Just do 5 minutes" → "Since I started, I'll do 15 more" → full engagement
- **When**: procrastination, resistance to starting

### Rule 5: End on a High
- Stop while things are going well, not when exhausted
- Leave a clear next step for tomorrow (Hemingway's technique)
- **When**: ongoing projects, maintaining motivation across sessions

### Rule 6: Visible Progress
- Order tasks so progress is visible after each one
- Prefer many small completions over one large task
- **When**: long projects, team morale

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Assess Energy and Motivation
- What's the current energy level? (high/medium/low)
- What's the current motivation? (eager/neutral/resistant)
- How long is the work session?

### Step 2: Match Tasks to State
- High energy + eager → hardest/most important task
- Low energy + resistant → quick win, then escalate
- Medium → alternate difficulty

### Step 3: Build in Recovery
- Break after 90 minutes of focused work
- Change task type after deep focus sessions
- Don't rely on willpower — design the sequence to maintain engagement

## When to Use
- Personal productivity planning
- Team sprint planning
- Any work involving human execution over time

## Verification
- [ ] Tasks ordered by difficulty/energy match
- [ ] Quick wins available for momentum
- [ ] Hard tasks scheduled at peak energy
- [ ] Recovery points included
- [ ] Clear next step at end of session
