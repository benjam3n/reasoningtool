# Budgeting

## Overview
Create, manage, and optimize budgets for projects, organizations, or personal finances

## Steps

### Step 1: Define budget scope and approach
Establish the boundaries and methodology for the budget:
1. Define what the budget covers (time period, activities, entities)
2. Identify the budget owner and approval chain
3. Select budgeting approach (zero-based, incremental, activity-based, envelope)
4. Determine level of detail needed
5. Set timeline for budget creation and approval

### Step 2: Gather inputs and historical data
Collect all information needed for accurate estimates:
1. Pull historical spending data from previous periods
2. Gather quotes and estimates for planned expenses
3. Review existing contracts and commitments
4. Interview stakeholders about requirements
5. Identify any known changes from previous periods

### Step 3: Identify and structure budget categories
Define the category structure for the budget:
1. Select appropriate category template (project/operational/personal)
2. Customize categories for your specific context
3. Ensure categories are mutually exclusive
4. Ensure categories are collectively exhaustive
5. Define clear criteria for categorizing expenses

### Step 4: Estimate costs for each category
Build bottom-up estimates for each budget line:
1. For each category, select estimation technique
2. Calculate estimate using chosen method
3. Document all assumptions behind estimates
4. Note confidence level (high/medium/low)
5. Flag any estimates requiring validation

### Step 5: Add contingency reserve
Calculate appropriate contingency based on risk:
1. Assess overall project/budget risk level
2. Review confidence levels of estimates
3. Check historical accuracy of similar budgets
4. Calculate contingency percentage
5. Add contingency as separate line item

### Step 6: Review and adjust against constraints
Compare draft budget to constraints and adjust:
1. Sum all line items plus contingency
2. Compare to budget constraint (if any)
3. If over budget, prioritize line items
4. Identify potential cuts or scope reductions
5. Document trade-offs and decisions
6. Negotiate with stakeholders as needed

### Step 7: Get budget approval
Prepare and submit budget for approval:
1. Create budget summary document
2. Include key assumptions and risks
3. Present to approvers
4. Address questions and concerns
5. Obtain formal approval signatures


## When to Use
- Starting a new project or venture that requires financial planning
- Beginning annual or quarterly planning cycles
- Facing financial constraints that require optimization
- Need to justify expenditure to stakeholders
- Transitioning from ad-hoc spending to structured budgeting
- Preparing for investor presentations or funding requests
- Evaluating cost reduction opportunities
- Managing cash flow during variable revenue periods

## Verification
- All cost categories are represented (no obvious gaps)
- Assumptions are documented for each estimate
- Contingency is appropriate for risk level
- Budget fits within constraints or variance is approved
- Tracking system is set up and ready to use
- Monitoring schedule is established
