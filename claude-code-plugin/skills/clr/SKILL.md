# Client Retention System

## Overview
Systematic approach to retaining clients through tiered engagement strategies and value-add touchpoints.

## Steps

### Step 1: Client Segmentation
Assign each client to a tier based on value:
- Tier 1 (Top 20%): High revenue, high potential, good fit
- Tier 2 (Next 30%): Moderate value, engagement potential
- Tier 3 (Bottom 50%): Lower value, maintain automated relationship

Score on: past revenue, future potential, ease of working together

### Step 2: CRM/Tracking Setup
Create tracking system with fields:
- Client name, company, contact info
- Tier assignment
- Engagement history (touchpoints sent, responses)
- Notes/preferences
- Last contact date
- Next scheduled contact

### Step 3: Template Creation
Create 5+ value-touch email templates:
1. Industry insight share
2. Resource/tool share
3. Check-in with value
4. Trigger response (news about their company/industry)
5. Re-engagement (for quiet clients)

Tone: Professional but warm, personalization required

### Step 4: Automation Setup
Configure automated systems:
- Follow-up reminders (never miss a contact date)
- Industry monitoring (Google Alerts for client companies)
- Calendar blocks for retention work (2-3 hours/week)
- Trigger alerts when client news detected

### Step 5: Layered Strategy Execution
Apply different strategies by tier:

ALL TIERS:
- Foundation layer: Consistent small-value touches (monthly)
- Intelligence layer: Trigger-based relevant outreach

TIER 1 ONLY:
- Strategic Sniper: Annual deep strategic review
- Inner Circle: Network facilitation (optional)

TIER 2:
- Partial network facilitation

TIER 3:
- Automated touches only

### Step 6: Weekly Rhythm
30-minute weekly retention review:
1. Check overdue contacts
2. Review triggers fired
3. Note responses received
4. Plan next week's touches
5. Update tracking system

### Step 7: Monthly Analysis
Calculate and review:
- Touches sent vs planned
- Response rate
- Positive/neutral/negative breakdown
- Trigger events detected and responded to

Adjust: templates, frequency, value types based on data

### Step 8: Quarterly Review
Evaluate progress toward targets:
- Repeat business rate (target: 30%+)
- Client lifetime value trend
- Referral rate
- Time to re-engagement

Decide: Persist / Adjust / Pivot


## When to Use
- Service-based business wanting repeat clients
- Consulting/freelance work with ongoing client relationships
- Any business where client lifetime value matters

## Verification
- Can look up any client's tier, last contact, next scheduled
- All templates ready for use
- Automation triggering correctly
- Repeat business rate measurable
