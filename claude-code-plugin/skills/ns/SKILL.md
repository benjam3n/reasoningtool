# Negotiation Strategy Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

In negotiations and strategic interactions, the order of moves determines outcomes. What you reveal first, what you ask for first, and when you make concessions all affect the other party's behavior. Game-theoretic orderings for sequential decisions.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Anchor First
- Make the first offer to set the reference point
- Subsequent discussion revolves around adjustments to the anchor
- **When**: you have better information than the counterparty

### Rule 2: Listen Before Proposing
- Understand what the other party wants before revealing what you want
- Information asymmetry is leverage
- **When**: you have less information, or the other party's priorities are unclear

### Rule 3: Easy Agreements First
- Start with points of agreement to build rapport and momentum
- Progress to contentious issues after trust is established
- **When**: complex multi-issue negotiations, relationship matters

### Rule 4: Linkage — Package Before Itemize
- Present issues as a package rather than negotiating item by item
- Enables trades across issues (I give on X, you give on Y)
- **When**: multi-issue negotiations, creating win-win

### Rule 5: Irreversible Concessions Last
- Make reversible concessions first (temporary, conditional)
- Save irreversible concessions for the end, when you know what you're getting
- **When**: high-stakes negotiations, trust is uncertain

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Assess the Situation
- What are your priorities? (rank issues)
- What are their likely priorities?
- What is your BATNA (best alternative)?
- Is this a one-time or repeated interaction?

### Step 2: Choose Strategy
- Strong position + good info → Anchor First
- Weak position or uncertain → Listen Before Proposing
- Complex multi-issue → Easy Agreements First + Linkage
- High stakes → Irreversible Last

### Step 3: Execute and Adapt
- Follow the ordering but adapt based on counterparty responses
- Reciprocate cooperation, don't reward bad faith

## When to Use
- Business negotiations, contract discussions
- Salary negotiations, partnership terms
- Any interaction where order of moves matters
