# Customer Discovery

## Overview
Validate customer problems and solutions before building

## Steps

### Step 1: Define hypothesis to test
State your assumptions clearly in testable form:
1. Customer: "I believe [customer segment] ..."
2. Problem: "... has the problem of [specific problem] ..."
3. Solution: "... which can be solved by [proposed solution] ..."
4. Value: "... and they would pay [price/effort] for it."

For each component, rate your confidence level (high/medium/low)
and identify what evidence would validate or invalidate it.

### Step 2: Identify and recruit interview targets
Define your early adopter profile:
- Has the problem acutely (not just mildly)
- Knows they have the problem (aware of pain)
- Actively seeking solution (not passive)
- Has budget/authority to buy
- Willing to try new things (not risk-averse)

Find them through:
- LinkedIn searches and outreach
- Online communities (Reddit, forums, Slack groups)
- Professional associations and events
- Referrals from your network
- Paid recruiting services if needed

Screen candidates with qualifying questions before scheduling.

### Step 3: Conduct problem interviews
For each interview, follow this structure:

Opening (2 min):
- Thank them for time
- Explain purpose: learning, not selling
- Ask permission to take notes

Context (5 min):
- "Tell me about your role/situation"
- "Walk me through a typical day/week"
- "What are your biggest challenges?"

Problem exploration (15 min):
- "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
- "What happened? Walk me through it"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do about it?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What does it cost you (time, money, stress)?"

Current solutions (10 min):
- "What do you do today to address this?"
- "What tools/processes do you use?"
- "What do you like about current approach?"
- "What do you wish was different?"
- "Have you tried other solutions? What happened?"

Wrap-up (3 min):
- Summarize what you heard
- Ask if you missed anything
- Ask for referrals
- Thank them

Listen for strong signals: they've tried to solve it, spending money,
frustrated with current solutions, ask when yours is available.

Avoid: pitching, leading questions, asking "would you buy X?"

### Step 4: Synthesize problem findings
Analyze interview data for patterns:
1. Group similar responses into themes
2. Count frequency of each theme
3. Note contradictions and outliers
4. Identify potential customer segments

Assess against validation criteria:
- Do 70%+ have the problem?
- Is it a top 3 priority for them?
- Are they spending time/money on it?
- Are current solutions inadequate?

Document surprising insights and questions for further exploration.

### Step 5: Conduct solution interviews
If problem is validated, test solution resonance:

Context (5 min):
- Briefly revisit the problem they described

Solution demo (10 min):
- Show mockup, prototype, or concept
- Explain key features and benefits
- Watch their reaction closely

Feedback (15 min):
- "What's your initial reaction?"
- "What do you like?"
- "What concerns you?"
- "What's missing?"
- "Would this solve your problem?"
- "How would this fit into your workflow?"

Commitment test (5 min):
- "If this existed today, would you use it?"
- "What would you pay for this?"
- "Can I add you to beta list?"
- "Would you pre-order/put down deposit?"

Track commitment ladder:
- Verbal interest (weak - polite response)
- Email/contact for updates (mild interest)
- Time commitment - more calls (moderate)
- Letter of intent (strong)
- Pre-order/deposit (very strong)

### Step 6: Synthesize and decide
Compile all findings into validation assessment:

Problem validation:
- Severity rating across interviews
- Willingness to pay for solution
- Underserved by current alternatives

Solution validation:
- Does it solve the validated problem?
- Is it preferred over alternatives?
- Is there commitment evidence (not just compliments)?
- Are objections addressable?

Make go/no-go recommendation:
- GO: Both problem and solution validated with evidence
- PIVOT: Problem validated but solution needs rework
- ITERATE: Need more interviews or different segment
- STOP: Problem not validated or market too small

### Step 7: Document and communicate findings
Create comprehensive discovery report:
1. Executive summary with recommendation
2. Hypothesis tested and validation results
3. Customer insights and segments identified
4. Key quotes and evidence
5. Recommended next steps

Share findings with stakeholders:
- Product team for solution refinement
- Leadership for go/no-go decision
- Sales/marketing for positioning insights

Update product roadmap or pivot plan based on findings.


## When to Use
- Starting a new product or business idea
- Before significant development investment (time, money, resources)
- When launching a new feature that requires substantial effort
- When assumptions about customer needs haven't been validated
- Pivoting or expanding into new markets or segments
- When previous product attempts have failed to gain traction
- Before committing to a specific solution architecture
- When stakeholders disagree about customer priorities

## Verification
- Sufficient interviews conducted (minimum 10-15 for problem discovery)
- Interviews were with qualified early adopter profiles
- Questions were open-ended and non-leading
- Listened more than talked in each interview
- Evidence includes specific quotes and behaviors, not just opinions
- Both confirming and disconfirming evidence was sought
- Commitment was tested with concrete asks, not hypotheticals
