# Exploratory Goals

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Most goal procedures assume you know what success looks like. Exploratory goals are different: success IS the discovery. You don't know what you're looking for until you find it. Requires breadth before depth, surprise as signal, and flexible termination.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Exploration Space
1. What domain/space are you exploring?
2. Boundaries? (in scope vs out)
3. Why explore? What motivated this?
4. What would a valuable discovery look like? (even vaguely)
5. What would make the exploration a waste?

### Step 2: Choose Exploration Strategy

| Knowledge Level | Strategy | Approach |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Know nothing | Random sampling | Wide, shallow passes |
| Know the dimensions | Systematic sweep | Cover each dimension |
| Know some regions | Expand from known | Explore adjacent areas |
| Have a hunch | Directed search | Follow hunch, verify no tunnel vision |

Allocate 70% exploration, 30% exploitation of findings. Set checkpoints to reassess.

### Step 3: Set Discovery Criteria
1. What counts as a "finding"? Minimum threshold: surprising, useful, or connective
2. What counts as "significant"?
3. Recording format (log, tags)

### Step 4: Execute Exploration Passes
Per pass:
1. Define scope (which region)
2. Execute using chosen strategy
3. Record: what found, what surprised, what questions raised, what connects
4. Rate: noise / minor / interesting / significant
5. After each pass: continue here or move to new region?

### Step 5: Synthesize
1. Cluster findings by theme
2. Identify patterns across findings
3. What's the emerging picture?
4. What are biggest surprises?
5. What new questions emerged?

### Step 6: Decide Next Direction
- **Go deeper**: One finding warrants deep investigation → targeted goal
- **Go wider**: More to discover → another pass
- **Stop**: Diminishing returns → document and close
- **Pivot**: Exploration revealed the REAL question → redefine

EXPLORATION REPORT:
Space: [description]
Strategy: [strategy]
Passes: [N]
Findings: [N total, N significant]

Key discoveries:
1. [discovery] — [significance]
2. [discovery] — [significance]

Patterns: [what findings suggest together]
Open questions: [still unknown]
Recommendation: [deeper / wider / stop / pivot]
```

## When to Use
- Research without a hypothesis
- Entering a new domain
- Creative brainstorming
- When you don't know what you don't know

## Verification
- [ ] Space defined with boundaries
- [ ] Strategy chosen and justified
- [ ] Discovery criteria set before exploring
- [ ] Findings recorded systematically
- [ ] Synthesis performed
- [ ] Next direction decided
