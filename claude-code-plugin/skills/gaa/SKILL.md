# GOSM Approach Audit

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Apply the system's own verification standards to the system itself. If GOSM claims to be rigorous, this rigor must survive self-application. This procedure identifies what GOSM claims, tests each claim, and honestly reports where it succeeds and fails.

## Steps

### Step 1: Inventory Claims
1. What does GOSM claim to do?
2. What does it claim to be better than?
3. What implicit claims does its design make?
4. What does its documentation promise?

### Step 2: Test Each Claim
For each claim, apply the system's own verification standard:
1. What evidence supports this claim?
2. What would falsify it?
3. Has it been tested? By whom? In what conditions?
4. → INVOKE: /araw [claim] for rigorous testing

### Step 3: Identify Limitations
1. Where does the system clearly NOT work?
2. Where does it work in theory but not in practice?
3. What assumptions does it make that may not hold?
4. Where is it overcomplicated for the value it provides?
5. Where is it underdeveloped?

### Step 4: Compare to Alternatives
1. What alternatives exist for what GOSM does?
2. Where are alternatives better?
3. Where is GOSM genuinely better?
4. Where is the comparison not yet made honestly?

### Step 5: Report Honestly
```
GOSM SELF-AUDIT:
Claims tested: [N]
Claims validated: [N]
Claims weakened: [N]
Claims refuted: [N]

Key strengths: [what genuinely works]
Key weaknesses: [what doesn't]
Key limitations: [where it shouldn't be used]
Improvement priorities: [what to fix first]
```

## When to Use
- Periodic system health check
- After major changes to the system
- When someone questions the system's validity

## Verification
- [ ] All major claims identified
- [ ] Each tested using the system's own standards
- [ ] Limitations stated honestly (not defensively)
- [ ] Comparison to alternatives attempted
