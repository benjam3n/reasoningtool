# Inversion Method (How to Fail)

## Overview
Charlie Munger's favorite technique: "Invert, always invert."
It's often easier to identify failure modes than success factors.
Finding ways to fail → Avoiding them → More likely to succeed.

Also known as: "Kill the company" exercise, Pre-mortem, Via negativa

## Goal
Find how to succeed by first asking "How would I guarantee failure?"
Then do the opposite. Inversion often reveals non-obvious insights.

## Steps

### Step 1: State the Goal
Clearly state what you're trying to achieve.
Be specific about what success looks like.

**Output**: Goal statement

### Step 2: Invert the Goal
Ask: "How would I GUARANTEE failure?"
Not "might fail" but "definitely fail."

Reframe: "If I wanted to [opposite of goal], what would I do?"

**Output**: Inverted goal

### Step 3: Brainstorm Failure Modes
List all the ways to guarantee failure.
Be thorough and honest. Include:
- Obvious failures
- Subtle failures
- Failures of omission (not doing things)
- Failures of commission (doing wrong things)
- Psychological failures (mindset, motivation)
- Environmental failures (wrong context, timing)

**Output**: Exhaustive failure list

### Step 4: Invert Each Failure Mode
For each failure mode, state its opposite.
This becomes a success factor.

**Output**: Success factors

### Step 5: Prioritize Success Factors
Not all success factors are equal.
Prioritize by:
- Impact (how much does this matter?)
- Controllability (can I actually do this?)
- Likelihood (how likely is the failure mode?)

**Output**: Prioritized success factors

### Step 6: Create Action Plan
Convert success factors to specific actions.
Include both:
- Things TO DO
- Things to AVOID

**Output**: Action plan


## When to Use
- Planning a project/venture
- Evaluating a strategy
- Improving a process
- Personal goals
- When "how to succeed" is unclear

## Verification
- Goal was clearly stated
- Failure modes are genuine (would actually cause failure)
- Inversions are true opposites
- Actions are specific and actionable
- Both do's and don'ts are included
