# Stakeholder Management

## Overview
Engage stakeholders effectively throughout the project

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify stakeholders
Create comprehensive list of everyone affected by or affecting the project:
1. Brainstorm stakeholder categories:
   Internal:
   - Executive sponsors and leadership
   - Project team members
   - Functional managers providing resources
   - Other project managers with dependencies
   - Affected departments/business units
   - IT, Legal, Finance, HR as appropriate
   - Internal users of deliverables
   External:
   - Customers and end users
   - Vendors and suppliers
   - Partners and contractors
   - Regulatory bodies
   - Industry groups
2. Use multiple techniques to identify:
   - Review organizational charts
   - Ask "who else should know about this?"
   - Check similar past projects
   - Ask each stakeholder who else matters
   - Review approval and decision processes
3. For each stakeholder, capture:
   - Name (or group name for large groups)
   - Title/Role
   - Organization/Department
   - Contact information
   - Relationship to project
4. Avoid common omissions:
   - People affected by change but not involved in creating it
   - Support and operations teams
   - Procurement and legal
   - Customer-facing staff
   - Those who failed past similar projects

### Step 2: Analyze stakeholders
Understand each stakeholder's position and needs:
1. For each stakeholder, assess:
   Interest:
   - What do they care about regarding this project?
   - How will the project affect them personally?
   - What's their motivation?
   - What do they need from the project?
   Influence/Power:
   - What's their authority over the project?
   - Can they provide or withhold resources?
   - Do they control key decisions?
   - What's their organizational influence?
   Attitude:
   - Are they a supporter, neutral, or resistor?
   - What's their history with similar initiatives?
   - What concerns might they have?
   - What would change their attitude?
2. Create power/interest grid:
   High Power, High Interest: Manage closely (key players)
   High Power, Low Interest: Keep satisfied
   Low Power, High Interest: Keep informed
   Low Power, Low Interest: Monitor
3. Identify stakeholder relationships:
   - Who influences whom?
   - What alliances exist?
   - What conflicts exist?
   - Who are the informal influencers?
4. Document expectations:
   - What does each stakeholder expect from the project?
   - What do they expect from the project team?
   - What are their success criteria?
   - How will they judge the project?

### Step 3: Build RACI matrix
Define clear responsibilities for decisions and deliverables:
1. Identify items needing RACI:
   - Major decisions (scope changes, budget, timeline)
   - Key deliverables
   - Important activities
   - Approval gates
2. For each item, assign roles:
   R - Responsible: Who does the work?
   A - Accountable: Who has final authority? (only one person)
   C - Consulted: Who must be consulted before decision? (two-way)
   I - Informed: Who must be told after decision? (one-way)
3. RACI rules:
   - Every item must have exactly one A
   - Every item must have at least one R
   - Minimize C's to avoid decision paralysis
   - Don't overload individuals with too many R's
4. Validate the matrix:
   - Review with key stakeholders
   - Check for gaps (items with no A or R)
   - Check for overload (too many R's for one person)
   - Ensure A's have appropriate authority
5. Common items for project RACI:
   - Scope change approval
   - Budget decisions
   - Risk acceptance
   - Quality sign-off
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline changes
   - Vendor selection
   - Go/no-go decisions

### Step 4: Develop communication plan
Define how each stakeholder will receive information:
1. For each stakeholder or stakeholder group, determine:
   What information they need:
   - Status updates
   - Decisions requiring input
   - Risk and issue alerts
   - Milestone achievements
   - Changes affecting them
   How often:
   - Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly
   - As-needed for urgent items
   - Based on project phase intensity
   What format:
   - Email updates
   - Meetings (1:1, group, all-hands)
   - Reports/dashboards
   - Presentations
   - Informal conversations
   Who delivers:
   - Project manager
   - Sponsor
   - Team lead
   - Subject matter expert
2. Create communication schedule:
   - Regular recurring communications
   - Milestone-based communications
   - Trigger-based communications
3. Design key communication artifacts:
   - Status report template
   - Executive summary format
   - Risk/issue escalation format
   - Meeting agendas
4. Define escalation paths:
   - When to escalate
   - To whom
   - Expected response time
5. Plan for difficult communications:
   - How to deliver bad news
   - How to manage expectations
   - How to handle disagreements

### Step 5: Develop engagement strategies
Create specific approaches for managing key stakeholders:
1. For each high-priority stakeholder, develop strategy:
   Current state:
   - Current attitude (supporter/neutral/resistor)
   - Current engagement level
   - Key concerns or interests
   Desired state:
   - What attitude and engagement do we need?
   - What support specifically do we need from them?
   Strategy to bridge gap:
   - Actions to build relationship
   - How to address their concerns
   - What value can we provide them?
   - Who can influence them positively?
2. Strategies for different stakeholder types:
   Supporters:
   - Keep engaged and informed
   - Leverage their influence
   - Ask them to advocate
   - Thank them publicly
   Neutrals:
   - Understand their concerns
   - Demonstrate value to them
   - Address their needs
   - Regular check-ins
   Resistors:
   - Understand root cause of resistance
   - Address legitimate concerns
   - Find common ground
   - Use influencers they trust
   - Document agreements
3. Relationship-building actions:
   - Regular 1:1 meetings with key stakeholders
   - Involve them in appropriate decisions
   - Seek their input and expertise
   - Keep promises, build trust
   - Give credit and recognition

### Step 6: Manage expectations
Align stakeholder expectations with project reality:
1. Surface all expectations:
   - Review documented expectations from analysis
   - Probe for unstated expectations
   - Check for conflicts between stakeholders
   - Identify unrealistic expectations
2. Address misaligned expectations:
   - Compare expectations to project charter
   - Identify gaps clearly
   - Discuss with stakeholders early
   - Negotiate realistic alternatives
   - Document agreements
3. Set expectations proactively:
   - Be clear about what will and won't be delivered
   - Explain constraints and tradeoffs
   - Describe decision-making process
   - Clarify their role and involvement
   - Under-promise, over-deliver
4. Manage ongoing expectations:
   - Regular reality checks
   - Early warning of potential issues
   - Re-baseline when changes occur
   - Celebrate wins, acknowledge setbacks honestly

### Step 7: Execute and monitor
Implement stakeholder management and adjust as needed:
1. Execute communication plan:
   - Deliver scheduled communications
   - Use appropriate templates
   - Track what was communicated to whom
2. Execute engagement strategies:
   - Hold planned stakeholder meetings
   - Take relationship-building actions
   - Address concerns as they arise
3. Track stakeholder issues:
   - Maintain stakeholder issues log
   - Track concerns raised
   - Document actions taken
   - Monitor resolution
4. Monitor stakeholder sentiment:
   - Watch for changes in attitude
   - Note escalating concerns
   - Identify new supporters or resistors
   - Track engagement levels
5. Adjust approach as needed:
   - Update stakeholder analysis quarterly
   - Revise strategies when attitudes change
   - Add new stakeholders as identified
   - Modify communication based on feedback


## When to Use
- At project initiation to identify and analyze stakeholders
- When planning communication and engagement strategies
- When stakeholder relationships need improvement
- When new stakeholders join the project
- When stakeholder concerns are escalating
- At key project milestones to update stakeholder analysis
- When navigating organizational politics affecting the project
- When resistance to the project emerges

## Verification
- All stakeholders are identified and documented
- Power/interest analysis complete for key stakeholders
- RACI matrix covers major decisions and deliverables
- Communication plan is realistic and being followed
- Key stakeholder concerns are tracked and addressed
- Stakeholder sentiment is monitored regularly
- Engagement strategies are in place for high-priority stakeholders
