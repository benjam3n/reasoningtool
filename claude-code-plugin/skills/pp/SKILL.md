## Overview

Structured approach to acquiring components, materials, and services. Prevents the common failures: ordering wrong parts, missing lead times, no backup suppliers, accepting defective goods.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define Requirements
1. What is needed? (part numbers, specs, quantities)
2. When is it needed? (deadline, project phase)
3. Quality requirements (tolerances, certifications, standards)
4. Budget constraints

### Step 2: Source Suppliers
1. Identify 2-3 potential suppliers per item (never single source for critical items)
2. Evaluate: price, lead time, quality history, reliability, MOQ
3. Request quotes with delivery timeline
4. Check: are there long-lead items that need ordering NOW?

### Step 3: Order
1. Create purchase order with: specs, quantity, price, delivery date, quality requirements
2. Confirm order receipt with supplier
3. Track order status (set reminders at milestones)
4. Have contingency if supplier fails to deliver

### Step 4: Receive and Verify
1. Inspect delivery against PO (quantity, part numbers, condition)
2. Quality check: does it meet spec? Visual inspection minimum, measurement for critical items
3. Document any discrepancies
4. Accept, reject, or conditionally accept with noted issues

### Step 5: Manage Inventory
1. Store properly (ESD protection, temperature, shelf life)
2. Track quantities and locations
3. Reorder before running out (set reorder points)

## When to Use
- Building physical products, prototypes, systems
- Any project requiring purchased components

## Verification
- [ ] Requirements specified before sourcing
- [ ] Multiple suppliers identified for critical items
- [ ] Lead times accounted for in project schedule
- [ ] Incoming quality verified
- [ ] Inventory tracked
