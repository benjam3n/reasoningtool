# Data Collection

## Overview
Systematic procedure for gathering research data through surveys, interviews, observation, and secondary sources

## Steps

### Step 1: Define data requirements
Determine what data you need to answer the research question:

1. IDENTIFY CONSTRUCTS
   - What concepts need to be measured?
   - What is the conceptual definition of each?
   - How will you know if you've measured it?

2. SPECIFY VARIABLES
   For each construct:
   - Name and type (continuous, categorical, etc.)
   - Unit of measurement
   - Expected range of values
   - Required precision

3. DETERMINE DATA TYPE NEEDED

   Quantitative data:
   - Numerical measurements
   - Counts and frequencies
   - Ratings and scales
   - Best for: Testing hypotheses, measuring magnitude

   Qualitative data:
   - Words, narratives, descriptions
   - Themes and meanings
   - Context and interpretation
   - Best for: Exploration, understanding experience

   Mixed methods:
   - Combine both types
   - Triangulation for validation
   - Complementary insights

4. ASSESS EXISTING MEASURES
   - Are validated instruments available?
   - What is their reliability and validity?
   - Are they appropriate for your population?
   - Do they need adaptation?

5. GAP ANALYSIS
   - What measures exist?
   - What needs to be created?
   - What validation is needed?

### Step 2: Design sampling strategy
Develop a plan for selecting study participants or units:

PROBABILITY SAMPLING (for generalization):

1. Simple Random Sampling
   - Every unit has equal chance of selection
   - Use: Homogeneous populations, sampling frame available
   - Method: Random number generator from complete list
   - Pro: Unbiased; Con: Requires complete list

2. Stratified Random Sampling
   - Divide population into strata, random sample within each
   - Use: Ensure representation of subgroups
   - Method: Sample proportionally or equally from each stratum
   - Pro: Guaranteed representation; Con: Need stratum info

3. Cluster Sampling
   - Randomly select clusters, then sample within clusters
   - Use: Geographically dispersed populations
   - Method: Random selection of schools, clinics, regions
   - Pro: Practical; Con: Less efficient, design effect

4. Systematic Sampling
   - Select every kth unit from list
   - Use: When random selection impractical
   - Method: Random start, then every kth
   - Pro: Simple; Con: Risk if list has periodicity

NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING (for depth, not generalization):

1. Purposive/Judgment Sampling
   - Researcher selects based on criteria
   - Use: Qualitative research, expert selection
   - Types: Maximum variation, typical case, extreme case

2. Convenience Sampling
   - Whoever is available
   - Use: Pilot studies, exploratory research
   - Limitation: Cannot generalize

3. Snowball Sampling
   - Participants recruit others
   - Use: Hidden or hard-to-reach populations
   - Limitation: Network effects, not random

4. Quota Sampling
   - Fill quotas for subgroups
   - Use: Ensure demographic representation
   - Limitation: Selection within quota not random

SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:

For quantitative:
- Power analysis (see statistical_analysis procedure)
- Rule of thumb: 30+ per group for central limit theorem
- Survey research: Consider response rate inflation

For qualitative:
- Saturation: Until no new themes emerge
- Typical range: 12-30 interviews for homogeneous group
- More for heterogeneous populations

Document:
- Sampling method and rationale
- Target sample size with justification
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Recruitment procedures

### Step 3: Design survey instruments
Create surveys and questionnaires (if applicable):

QUESTION TYPES:

1. Closed-ended questions
   - Multiple choice: Select one from options
   - Multiple response: Select all that apply
   - Rating scales: Likert, semantic differential
   - Ranking: Order options by preference
   - Pro: Easy to analyze; Con: May miss nuance

2. Open-ended questions
   - Free text response
   - Pro: Rich data; Con: Harder to analyze
   - Use sparingly; at end of survey

SCALE DESIGN:

Likert scales:
- Typically 5 or 7 points
- Balanced (equal positive/negative options)
- Include neutral midpoint (usually)
- Label all points or just endpoints

Examples:
- 5-point agreement: Strongly disagree to Strongly agree
- 5-point frequency: Never to Always
- 7-point satisfaction: Extremely dissatisfied to Extremely satisfied

QUESTION WRITING RULES:

DO:
- Use simple, clear language
- Ask one thing per question (no double-barreled)
- Define terms that might be ambiguous
- Ensure response options are exhaustive and exclusive
- Include "Not applicable" or "Don't know" when appropriate

DON'T:
- Use leading or loaded questions
- Use double negatives
- Assume knowledge respondent may not have
- Use jargon or technical terms without definition
- Make questions too long

SURVEY STRUCTURE:

1. Introduction
   - Purpose of study
   - Time estimate
   - Confidentiality statement
   - Consent information

2. Screening questions
   - Verify eligibility
   - Route to appropriate sections

3. Main questions
   - Start with easy, engaging questions
   - Group by topic
   - Place sensitive questions later
   - Logical flow within sections

4. Demographics
   - Usually at end (unless needed for screening)
   - Only collect what's needed

5. Closing
   - Thank participant
   - Provide contact for questions

PILOT TESTING:
- Test with 5-10 similar respondents
- Check: Comprehension, timing, technical issues
- Cognitive interviews: Ask respondents to think aloud
- Revise based on feedback

### Step 4: Design interview and focus group protocols
Create protocols for qualitative data collection (if applicable):

INTERVIEW TYPES:

1. Structured interviews
   - Fixed questions in fixed order
   - All participants get same questions
   - Use: Systematic data for comparison
   - Easier to analyze; less depth

2. Semi-structured interviews
   - Guide with key topics/questions
   - Flexibility to probe and follow-up
   - Use: Balance structure and depth
   - Most common in qualitative research

3. Unstructured interviews
   - Minimal predetermined questions
   - Conversation-like, participant-led
   - Use: Exploratory, understanding lived experience
   - Hardest to analyze; richest data

INTERVIEW GUIDE DESIGN:

Structure:
1. Introduction (5 min)
   - Introduce yourself and study
   - Explain process, recording, confidentiality
   - Obtain consent
   - Warm-up question (easy, rapport-building)

2. Main questions (majority of time)
   - Start broad, then narrow
   - Use open-ended questions
   - Group by theme
   - Include probes for each question

3. Closing (5 min)
   - Wrap-up question ("Anything else?")
   - Thank participant
   - Explain next steps

QUESTION TYPES FOR INTERVIEWS:

- Grand tour: "Tell me about your experience with..."
- Specific: "What happened when...?"
- Contrast: "How does X compare to Y?"
- Hypothetical: "What would happen if...?"
- Devil's advocate: "Some people say... What do you think?"

PROBES (follow-up techniques):
- Elaboration: "Tell me more about that"
- Clarification: "What do you mean by...?"
- Example: "Can you give me an example?"
- Silence: Pause and wait for more
- Echo: Repeat last phrase as question

FOCUS GROUP CONSIDERATIONS:

Group composition:
- Typically 6-10 participants
- Homogeneous enough for comfort
- Heterogeneous enough for diverse views

Moderator guide:
- Opening activity/icebreaker
- 5-6 main discussion questions
- Activities if appropriate (card sorts, etc.)
- Plan for dominant/quiet participants

Logistics:
- Room setup (circle or U-shape)
- Recording equipment (audio, video)
- Note-taker role
- Refreshments (builds rapport)

### Step 5: Plan observational methods
Design systematic observation protocols (if applicable):

OBSERVATION TYPES:

1. Participant observation
   - Researcher participates in setting
   - Insider perspective
   - Use: Ethnography, understanding culture
   - Challenge: Maintain objectivity

2. Non-participant observation
   - Researcher observes without participating
   - Outsider perspective
   - Use: Behavior coding, unobtrusive measurement
   - Challenge: May miss context

3. Structured observation
   - Predetermined behaviors to observe
   - Coding scheme with categories
   - Quantifiable data
   - Use: Testing specific hypotheses

4. Unstructured observation
   - Open-ended field notes
   - Emergent categories
   - Qualitative data
   - Use: Exploration, discovery

DEVELOPING OBSERVATION PROTOCOL:

1. Define what to observe
   - Specific behaviors, events, interactions
   - Physical environment
   - Time and duration

2. Create coding scheme (for structured)
   - Mutually exclusive categories
   - Exhaustive (covers all possibilities)
   - Operational definitions for each code
   - Examples and non-examples

3. Determine recording method
   - Real-time coding: Code as events occur
   - Interval recording: Code at fixed intervals
   - Event recording: Code each occurrence
   - Narrative: Write field notes

4. Plan observation schedule
   - When and where to observe
   - Duration of sessions
   - Number of sessions needed
   - Sampling of times/locations

FIELD NOTES:

Include:
- Date, time, location, duration
- Who was present
- What happened (descriptive)
- Your interpretations (separate from description)
- Questions and reflections

Write up:
- During observation: Brief notes
- Immediately after: Expand to full notes
- Regular memos: Emerging themes and insights

INTER-RATER RELIABILITY:

For structured observation:
- Train multiple observers
- Have them code same sessions
- Calculate agreement (Cohen's kappa)
- Target: kappa > 0.80
- Resolve disagreements through discussion

### Step 6: Identify and evaluate secondary data
Assess and acquire existing data sources (if applicable):

TYPES OF SECONDARY DATA:

1. Official statistics
   - Government data (census, BLS, CDC)
   - International organizations (World Bank, UN)
   - Pro: Large scale, authoritative
   - Con: May not match your exact needs

2. Administrative data
   - Records created for operational purposes
   - Health records, school records, transaction logs
   - Pro: Covers entire population, objective
   - Con: Not designed for research, access issues

3. Survey data archives
   - Data from previous surveys
   - ICPSR, Pew, GSS, etc.
   - Pro: Often high quality, documented
   - Con: Variables may not match your needs

4. Research datasets
   - Data from previous studies
   - Shared by researchers for replication
   - Pro: Relevant to your field
   - Con: May have restrictions

5. Commercial data
   - Purchased from data vendors
   - Market research, consumer behavior
   - Pro: Detailed, proprietary
   - Con: Expensive, unclear methodology

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Relevance
   - Does it measure what you need?
   - Does it cover your population?
   - Is the time period appropriate?

2. Quality
   - How was data collected?
   - What is the sample size and response rate?
   - Are there known quality issues?
   - Is methodology documented?

3. Availability
   - Is data publicly available?
   - What are access restrictions?
   - Cost to acquire?
   - Data use agreements required?

4. Documentation
   - Is there a codebook?
   - Are variables well-defined?
   - Is methodology described?
   - Are limitations documented?

COMBINING DATA SOURCES:

- Ensure compatible definitions
- Harmonize coding schemes
- Document any transformations
- Be aware of different error structures

### Step 7: Develop quality assurance procedures
Plan for ensuring data quality throughout collection:

PREVENTION (before/during collection):

1. Training
   - Train all data collectors
   - Standardize procedures
   - Practice with mock sessions
   - Certification/testing

2. Standardization
   - Written protocols for all procedures
   - Scripts for surveys/interviews
   - Decision rules for ambiguous situations

3. Built-in checks
   - Validation rules in electronic surveys
   - Range checks (flag out-of-range values)
   - Consistency checks (flag contradictions)
   - Attention checks (catch inattentive respondents)

MONITORING (during collection):

1. Progress tracking
   - Monitor response rates
   - Track completion times
   - Identify problematic items/sections

2. Ongoing review
   - Review first batch of data closely
   - Check for interviewer effects
   - Spot-check recordings/transcripts

3. Regular calibration
   - Periodic retraining
   - Inter-rater reliability checks
   - Address drift in coding

CLEANING (after collection):

1. Data validation
   - Check for duplicates
   - Verify range constraints
   - Check skip logic executed correctly
   - Validate against external data if possible

2. Missing data assessment
   - Extent of missingness
   - Patterns (random vs. systematic)
   - Reasons for missingness

3. Outlier identification
   - Statistical detection methods
   - Investigate flagged values
   - Decide: Correct, exclude, or retain

4. Documentation
   - Data dictionary with all variables
   - Record all cleaning decisions
   - Version control for datasets

RESPONSE RATE AND NON-RESPONSE:

- Track response rate: Completed / Eligible contacted
- Analyze non-response: Do responders differ from non-responders?
- Non-response bias analysis if possible
- Document efforts to maximize response

### Step 8: Address ethical considerations
Ensure ethical data collection:

CORE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES:

1. Respect for persons (autonomy)
   - Informed consent
   - Voluntary participation
   - Right to withdraw
   - Protect those with diminished autonomy

2. Beneficence
   - Maximize benefits
   - Minimize harm
   - Balance risks and benefits

3. Justice
   - Fair selection of participants
   - Equitable distribution of burdens and benefits
   - No exploitation of vulnerable groups

INFORMED CONSENT:

Must include:
- Purpose of research
- Procedures involved
- Duration of participation
- Risks and benefits
- Confidentiality protections
- Voluntary nature, right to withdraw
- Contact information for questions

Documentation:
- Written consent for most research
- Verbal consent with waiver if justified
- Online: Click-through consent
- Keep consent forms separate from data

Special populations:
- Children: Parental consent + child assent
- Cognitively impaired: Legally authorized representative
- Prisoners: Special protections required

CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY:

Data protection:
- De-identify data (remove names, IDs)
- Secure storage (encryption, access controls)
- Limited access (need-to-know basis)
- Secure disposal when no longer needed

Anonymity vs. confidentiality:
- Anonymous: You don't know who provided data
- Confidential: You know but protect identity

Reporting:
- Never report individual-level identifying data
- Suppress small cells in tables
- Use pseudonyms in qualitative reports

IRB/ETHICS REVIEW:

Categories:
- Exempt: Minimal risk, standard procedures
- Expedited: Minimal risk, more complex
- Full board: Greater than minimal risk

Prepare:
- Protocol describing all procedures
- Consent documents
- Data collection instruments
- Data security plan

Ongoing:
- Report adverse events
- Get approval for protocol changes
- Annual renewal if continuing
