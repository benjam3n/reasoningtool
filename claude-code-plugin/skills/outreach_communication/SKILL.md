# Outreach Communication

## Overview
Craft and send high-quality outreach communications that maximize response rates

## Steps

### Step 1: Research and context gathering
Before drafting, gather all relevant context:

1. Recipient research:
   - Full name and correct title
   - Organization and their role in it
   - Any prior interactions or relationship
   - Their likely concerns and priorities
   - Best communication channel

2. Subject matter preparation:
   - Key facts and data to include
   - Quantified impacts (numbers, not vague claims)
   - Before/after comparisons if applicable
   - Supporting materials to attach

3. Strategic considerations:
   - Why would THIS person care?
   - What's in it for THEM specifically?
   - What objections might they have?
   - Who else might need to approve?

SAFETY: Only use publicly available information or information
provided by the user. Do not attempt to access private data.

### Step 2: Draft subject line
Create subject line that maximizes open rate:

Format: "[Benefit/Hook] - [Specific Context]"

Good examples:
- "Free Infrastructure Opportunity - [City Name] Railroad Crossing"
- "Zero-Cost Safety Improvement - Request for Brief Support"
- "$30M Tunnel Opportunity - [Organization] Partnership"

Avoid:
- Vague subjects ("Quick question", "Following up", "Hi")
- Clickbait ("You won't believe...")
- All caps or excessive punctuation
- Generic ("Request", "Inquiry", "Question")
- Too long (keep under 50 characters if possible)

SAFETY: Subject must be accurate and not misleading.

### Step 3: Compose opening hook
First 1-2 sentences must establish relevance immediately:

Purpose: Get them to keep reading
Format: Why THIS person should care
Max length: 2 sentences

Structure:
- State the opportunity/situation
- Connect it to THEIR role/organization

Example:
"The Boring Company is awarding a free 1-mile tunnel to the winning
proposal in their Tunnel Vision competition. I'm preparing a submission
focused on [their jurisdiction/asset]."

Do NOT start with:
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "My name is X and I am..."
- Long background before the point
- Apologies for reaching out

SAFETY: Opening must be truthful and verifiable.

### Step 4: Describe the situation
Establish shared understanding of the context:

Include:
- Current state (problem or opportunity)
- Quantified impact (numbers, not adjectives)
- Why it matters to THEM specifically

Example:
"The railroad crossing at [Location] has seen [X] fatalities in the
past decade. For [Railroad], this represents ongoing liability exposure
and operational delays. For [City], it's a persistent safety concern."

Use data whenever possible:
- "[X] fatalities over [Y] years"
- "[X] vehicles per day affected"
- "[X] minutes of daily delays"
- "$[X] estimated cost/impact"

SAFETY: All facts must be verified and sourced.
Note source of data if not widely known.

### Step 5: State the ask clearly
Make the request crystal clear and specific:

Must include:
- EXACTLY what you need
- EXACTLY what form it takes
- EXACTLY by when

Format: "I'm requesting [specific thing] by [specific date]."

Good example:
"I'm requesting a brief letter of support (1 page or less) on
[Organization] letterhead by February 9, 2026."

Bad examples:
- "Would you be willing to provide some support?"
- "Let me know if you can help."
- "Any assistance would be appreciated."

SAFETY: Ask must be reasonable and appropriate for the relationship.
Do not ask for confidential information or inappropriate favors.

### Step 6: Articulate their benefit (WIIFM)
Explain why saying yes is in THEIR best interest:

Address:
- What they gain
- What risk is removed
- What cost is avoided
- What recognition they get

Example:
"For [Railroad], this tunnel would:
- Eliminate liability from crossing incidents
- Remove train-vehicle delay events
- Demonstrate safety leadership
- Cost nothing (TBC builds for free if selected)"

Key principle: Lead with THEIR benefit, not yours.

SAFETY: Benefits must be real and achievable, not exaggerated.

### Step 7: Provide action instructions
Make it as easy as possible to say yes:

Include step-by-step instructions with multiple options:

OPTION A (Easiest):
"Reply to this email with 'Yes, send me a draft' and I'll
prepare everything for your signature."

OPTION B (Self-service):
"Download the attached draft letter template, modify as needed,
print on letterhead, sign, and email back as PDF."

OPTION C (Need more info):
"If you need more information first, reply with your questions
or suggest a brief call time."

Principle: Remove all friction. The easier to say yes, the
higher the response rate.

SAFETY: Do not pressure or manipulate. Provide genuine options
including graceful ways to decline.

### Step 8: Show before/after outcome
Make the outcome concrete with visual comparison:

Format:
CURRENT: [Quantified current state]
AFTER: [Quantified future state if they act]

Example:
"CURRENT: Crossing averages 0.3 fatalities/year, 15 min daily delays
AFTER TUNNEL: Zero crossing fatalities, zero delays, permanently

If selected, construction could begin 2027, completion 2028."

Use tables for complex comparisons:
| Metric | Today | After |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Fatality risk | X | 0 |
| Daily delays | Y | 0 |
| Cost to you | N/A | $0 |

SAFETY: Projections must be realistic and supportable.

### Step 9: Assemble and format
Combine all elements into scannable format:

Structure:
1. Subject line
2. Salutation
3. Opening hook (1-2 sentences)
4. The situation (1 paragraph)
5. The ask (clearly labeled, specific)
6. Why say yes (bulleted benefits)
7. How to act (numbered options)
8. Before/after (table if complex)
9. Closing (offer to discuss)
10. Signature with full contact info

Formatting guidelines:
- Use headers/bold for scanability
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include whitespace
- Put most important info early

SAFETY: Review complete draft before marking ready.
Flag any concerns about tone or content.

### Step 10: Create follow-up plan
Plan for if no response received:

Follow-up schedule:
- Day 3-4: If no response, send brief follow-up
- Day 7-8: If still no response, try different channel or escalate
- Day 14+: Final attempt or move to next contact

Follow-up principles:
- Acknowledge previous email briefly
- Restate core ask
- Make response even easier
- Provide new information if available

SAFETY: Respect boundaries. Maximum 2-3 follow-ups.
If explicit decline received, stop contact immediately.

### Step 11: Log and track
Create tracking entry for this outreach:

Record:
- Recipient name and organization
- Date and time sent
- Subject and summary of ask
- Status (sent/pending approval/draft)
- Next action date
- Any response received

Update stakeholder database if applicable.

SAFETY: All communications logged for audit.
Human approval required before sending.


## When to Use
- Initial contact with stakeholders for support or information
- Follow-up communications when no response received
- Requesting specific action (letters of support, meetings, data)
- Building relationships for project success
- Gathering information from external sources
- Coordinating with multiple parties on shared objectives
- Introducing proposals or opportunities to decision makers
- Re-engaging after previous positive interaction

## Verification
- Subject line is specific and benefit-oriented
- Opening establishes relevance within 2 sentences
- Ask is specific, bounded, and has deadline
- WIIFM (benefits to recipient) are clear and specific
- Action steps are easy to follow with multiple options
- Formatting is scannable with clear visual hierarchy
- Tone is professional-warm, not corporate-speak
- All facts are verified and sourced
- Human has approved before sending
