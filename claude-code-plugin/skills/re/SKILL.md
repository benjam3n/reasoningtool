# Reading Effectively

## Overview
Read strategically for comprehension, retention, and application using research-backed techniques

## Steps

### Step 1: Clarify reading purpose
Define why you're reading before you start:
1. What do you need to get from this reading?
2. How will you use what you learn?
3. What questions do you want answered?
4. What's your deadline or time constraint?
5. Is this reference, learning, or application?

Purpose types:
- Overview: Get the gist, decide if worth more time
- Information: Extract specific facts or answers
- Understanding: Deeply comprehend concepts
- Mastery: Learn for later teaching or expert application
- Enjoyment: Pleasure reading (different rules apply)

Purpose → Strategy:
- Overview → Scanning/skimming
- Information → Targeted reading, search
- Understanding → Active reading (SQ3R)
- Mastery → Study reading with review cycles

### Step 2: Preview the material
Survey before deep reading (Survey from SQ3R):
1. Read title, subtitle, author information
2. Read preface/introduction (author's purpose and approach)
3. Scan table of contents (structure and scope)
4. Look at chapter headings and subheadings
5. Examine figures, diagrams, tables
6. Read conclusion/summary
7. Check index for key terms

Preview questions:
- What is this about overall?
- How is it organized?
- What does the author seem to emphasize?
- What do I already know about this?
- What do I expect to learn?

Time: 10-15 minutes for a book chapter, 5 minutes for an article

### Step 3: Generate questions
Convert structure into questions (Question from SQ3R):
1. Turn each heading/subheading into a question
2. Add questions from your purpose
3. Add questions from curiosity
4. Write questions down (don't just think them)
5. Use questions to create reading purpose

Question types:
- Factual: "What is X?"
- Explanatory: "Why does X happen?"
- Relational: "How does X relate to Y?"
- Application: "How can I use X?"
- Critical: "Is X actually true? What's the evidence?"

Example transformations:
- "Types of Memory" → "What are the types of memory? How do they differ?"
- "Causes of Depression" → "What causes depression? Which causes are most important?"

### Step 4: Read actively
Read with engagement, seeking answers (Read from SQ3R):
1. Read one section at a time
2. Read to answer your questions
3. Slow down for difficult parts
4. Mark key passages and confusions
5. Pause to check understanding

Active reading behaviors:
- Ask "What is the main point here?"
- Ask "How does this connect to what I know?"
- Ask "What's the evidence for this claim?"
- Mark important passages
- Note questions and reactions
- Pause at section ends to summarize mentally

If struggling:
- Re-read the difficult section
- Read more slowly
- Look up unknown terms
- Skip and return later
- Seek supplementary explanation

### Step 5: Recite and recall
Test comprehension without looking (Recite from SQ3R):
1. After each section, close the book/look away
2. Recall the main points from memory
3. Answer your questions from memory
4. Note what you couldn't recall
5. Check against text and fill gaps

Recitation methods:
- Say aloud: "This section was about... The main points were..."
- Write brief summary (few sentences)
- Answer questions without looking
- Explain to an imaginary person

Why this works:
- Retrieval strengthens memory (testing effect)
- Reveals what you actually understood vs. felt you understood
- Identifies gaps while they can still be filled

Frequency: After each section (not just at end)

### Step 6: Take structured notes
Create durable notes for later use:
1. Choose note-taking system based on material and purpose
2. Capture in your own words (not copying)
3. Include key concepts, definitions, examples
4. Note connections to other knowledge
5. Record questions and reactions

Note content:
- Main ideas and supporting points
- Key terms and definitions
- Important examples
- Your questions and reactions
- Connections to other knowledge
- Potential applications

Note quality check:
- Could understand these notes in 6 months?
- Could someone else understand them?
- Are they in your words, not author's?
- Do they capture what matters most?

### Step 7: Review and consolidate
Strengthen retention and prepare for use (Review from SQ3R):
1. Review notes immediately after finishing
2. Test yourself on key points
3. Identify what's most important
4. Connect to existing knowledge
5. Plan how to use/apply what you learned
6. Schedule follow-up review

Review activities:
- Read through notes
- Cover notes, test recall of main points
- Answer original questions from memory
- Explain the material as if teaching
- Identify specific applications

Follow-up schedule:
- Same day: Brief review
- Next day: Test recall
- One week: Review and apply
- One month: Reinforce or move to SRS if needed


## When to Use
- Reading textbooks or technical material for learning
- Reading non-fiction for knowledge extraction
- Preparing for exams or professional application
- When retention matters, not just exposure
- When reading efficiency needs improvement
- Tackling difficult or dense material
- Building knowledge in a new field
- When you've read but can't recall or apply

## Verification
- Reading purpose is clear before starting
- Preview creates structure before deep reading
- Questions guide reading (not passive consumption)
- Active reading behaviors are employed
- Recall is tested during and after reading
- Notes are in own words and usable
- Review and application are planned
