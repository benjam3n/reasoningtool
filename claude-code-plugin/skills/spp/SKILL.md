# Spatial Proteomics

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Spatial proteomics maps where proteins are in cells and tissues, revealing organization that bulk measurements miss. This procedure guides technology selection, experiment design, data analysis, and biological interpretation for spatial protein profiling.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Biological Question
1. What do you want to learn about protein spatial organization?
2. Scale: subcellular / cellular / tissue / organ?
3. Multiplexing need: how many proteins simultaneously?
4. Throughput: how many samples/conditions?
5. Quantitative or qualitative readout?

### Step 2: Select Technology

| Method | Proteins | Resolution | Throughput | Best for |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| IF/IHC | 1-5 | Subcellular | High | Targeted validation |
| CODEX/PhenoCycler | 40-60 | Cellular | Medium | Tissue phenotyping |
| MIBI-TOF | 40+ | Subcellular | Low | High-resolution tissue |
| IMC | 40+ | ~1μm | Low-Medium | Metal-tagged antibodies |
| MERFISH (protein) | 100+ | Subcellular | Medium | High-plex subcellular |
| Mass spec imaging | 1000+ | ~10-50μm | Low | Discovery/unbiased |

Selection criteria: resolution needed, multiplexing need, sample type, available equipment.

### Step 3: Design the Experiment
1. Panel design: select proteins based on question (markers, targets, controls)
2. Antibody validation: confirm specificity for spatial context
3. Sample preparation: fixation, sectioning, antigen retrieval optimization
4. Controls: positive tissue, negative controls, isotype controls
5. Technical replicates: minimum 3 per condition
6. ROI selection strategy: random, targeted, or hybrid

### Step 4: Execute and Acquire Data
1. Process samples per protocol
2. Acquire images/data per technology requirements
3. Include quality control checks at each stage
4. Document all deviations from protocol

### Step 5: Analyze Spatial Data
1. **Cell segmentation**: identify individual cells
2. **Phenotyping**: classify cell types based on marker expression
3. **Spatial statistics**: analyze neighborhood composition, distances, interactions
   - Nearest neighbor analysis
   - Spatial autocorrelation
   - Interaction analysis (which cell types are adjacent?)
4. **Cluster analysis**: identify spatial niches or microenvironments
5. **Comparison**: statistical testing across conditions/samples

### Step 6: Interpret and Validate
1. What spatial patterns emerge?
2. Do patterns correlate with biological outcomes?
3. Validate key findings with orthogonal methods
4. Place findings in biological context
5. Identify mechanistic hypotheses generated by spatial data
