## Overview
Systematic procedure for preparing and delivering impactful presentations, speeches, and talks

## Steps

### Step 1: Analyze audience and context
Before creating any content, understand your audience deeply:
1. Who will be in the room? (roles, demographics, group size)
2. What do they already know about this topic?
3. What do they expect from this presentation?
4. What are their pain points or concerns related to your topic?
5. What would make this talk valuable TO THEM?
6. What's the physical/virtual setup? (room size, AV, remote)
7. What happens before and after your talk? (context matters)

### Step 2: Define your core message
Distill your talk to one essential message:
1. If the audience remembers only ONE thing, what should it be?
2. Write your core message in one sentence (15 words or less)
3. Test: Would someone who missed your talk understand it from this sentence?
4. This message should appear at least 3 times in your talk
5. All content should support or illustrate this message
6. If content doesn't serve the core message, cut it

### Step 3: Structure your content
Build the architecture of your talk:

Opening (10-15% of time):
- Hook: Grab attention in first 30 seconds (story, question, surprising fact)
- Establish credibility and relevance
- Preview: Tell them what you'll tell them
- State your core message

Body (70-80% of time):
- Limit to 3 main points (audiences can't absorb more)
- Each point follows: Claim -> Evidence -> Example -> Relevance
- Include stories and concrete examples (not just abstract concepts)
- Build in transitions between sections
- Return to core message after each main point

Close (10-15% of time):
- Signal you're concluding ("In closing..." not "So, yeah...")
- Summarize: Tell them what you told them
- Restate core message powerfully
- Call to action: What should they do with this information?
- Strong final line (not "Any questions?")

### Step 4: Develop stories and examples
Make abstract concepts concrete and memorable:
1. For each main point, find at least one specific story or example
2. Stories should have: character, conflict, resolution, lesson
3. Use the "STAR" format: Situation, Task, Action, Result
4. Personal stories are more compelling than hypotheticals
5. Make examples relevant to THIS audience's experience
6. Include sensory details that help people visualize
7. Practice telling each story until it flows naturally

### Step 5: Create visual aids (if applicable)
Design slides or visuals that enhance, not compete with, your message:
1. Slides support YOU, not replace you (you are the presentation)
2. One idea per slide maximum
3. Use images over text whenever possible
4. If using text: 6 words or fewer per slide
5. No bullet points if you can avoid them
6. Data should be visualized, not shown in tables
7. Use consistent, simple design (no busy templates)
8. Include blank/pause slides for key moments
9. Number slides for easy navigation during Q&A

### Step 6: Prepare for Q&A
Anticipate and prepare for audience questions:
1. List 10 questions you might be asked (hardest ones first)
2. Prepare concise answers for each (30-60 seconds)
3. Practice bridging from hostile questions to your message
4. Prepare "I don't know" responses that maintain credibility
5. Plan for common Q&A challenges (tangential questions, hostile questioners)
6. Prepare 2-3 questions to seed if audience is quiet
7. Decide how you'll handle questions during vs after the talk

### Step 7: Practice delivery
Rehearse until delivery is natural, not memorized:

Practice sequence:
1. Read through silently (content familiarization)
2. Talk through sections out loud (find your words)
3. Full run-through standing up with slides (timing)
4. Record yourself and review (identify weak spots)
5. Practice in front of someone and get feedback
6. Final run-throughs focusing on weak spots

Delivery elements to practice:
- Opening: Practice until it's automatic under stress
- Transitions: Know exactly how to move between sections
- Stories: Tell them until they flow naturally
- Closing: Memorize your final line word-for-word
- Timing: Know which sections to cut if running long

Volume: Minimum 3 full run-throughs, more for important talks

### Step 8: Manage nerves and energy
Channel anxiety into positive energy:

Before the talk:
- Reframe: Nervousness is excitement, your body preparing to perform
- Prepare obsessively: Confidence comes from preparation
- Arrive early: Familiarize yourself with room and equipment
- Move your body: Walk, stretch, do light exercise to burn adrenaline
- Breathe: 4 counts in, 4 counts hold, 4 counts out (repeat 5x)
- Power pose: 2 minutes of expansive posture before going on
- Visualize success: See yourself delivering confidently

During the talk:
- Focus on serving the audience, not on yourself
- Find friendly faces to speak to
- If you lose your place, pause and breathe (feels longer to you)
- Move purposefully to channel nervous energy
- Remember: Audience wants you to succeed

After the talk:
- Adrenaline will spike - this is normal
- Don't immediately critique yourself harshly
- Write down what worked while it's fresh

### Step 9: Deliver the presentation
Execute your preparation with presence and connection:

Physical presence:
- Stand grounded, feet shoulder-width apart
- Make eye contact (3-5 seconds per person, or sections for large rooms)
- Use purposeful gestures (avoid fidgeting or repetitive movements)
- Move with intention (not pacing)
- Vary your position in the room

Vocal delivery:
- Speak louder and slower than feels natural
- Pause before and after key points (silence is powerful)
- Vary pace and pitch to maintain interest
- Emphasize key words with volume or pause
- Avoid filler words (um, uh, like, so)

Audience connection:
- Start with the audience, not your slides
- Read the room and adapt (energy level, confusion, engagement)
- Ask questions to involve the audience
- Acknowledge reactions (laughter, nodding, confusion)
- Be genuinely present, not performing a script

### Step 10: Handle Q&A effectively
Manage questions with confidence and clarity:

Receiving questions:
- Listen fully before formulating response
- Repeat or paraphrase question for large audiences
- Thank the questioner genuinely (not perfunctorily)
- If unclear, ask for clarification

Answering questions:
- Keep answers concise (30-60 seconds typical)
- Structure: Answer, Evidence, Bridge back to message
- It's okay to say "I don't know, but I'll find out"
- Redirect off-topic questions: "That's interesting - let's discuss offline"
- Address the whole room, not just the questioner

Difficult situations:
- Hostile questioner: Stay calm, acknowledge their point, bridge to your message
- Long-winded questioner: Wait for breath, summarize their question, answer briefly
- No questions: Ask your seeded question, or "A question I often get is..."
- Wrong question: Answer the question they should have asked

### Step 11: Reflect and improve
Capture learnings while they're fresh:
1. What went well? (specific moments, audience reactions)
2. What would you do differently?
3. Where did the audience engage most? Least?
4. Did the core message land?
5. How was your pacing and timing?
6. What questions revealed gaps in your content?
7. Get feedback from trusted observers if possible
8. Watch recording if available (painful but valuable)
