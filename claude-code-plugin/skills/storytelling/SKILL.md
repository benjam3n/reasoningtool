# Storytelling

## Overview
Systematic procedure for crafting and delivering compelling stories that create emotional connection and drive action

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the story's purpose and message
Before selecting or crafting a story, clarify what it must accomplish:
1. What's the ONE point you want this story to make?
2. What emotion do you want the audience to feel?
3. What action or belief change should result?
4. Why does this audience need to hear this story?
5. What makes this the right moment for this story?
6. What would be lost if you just stated the point without a story?

### Step 2: Select or develop your story
Choose the right story from your experiences or craft one:

Story sources (in order of impact):
1. Personal experience (most powerful, most vulnerable)
2. Someone you know directly (still personal, less vulnerable)
3. Customer/user stories (powerful for business contexts)
4. Historical or well-known stories (least vulnerable, most universal)
5. Hypothetical scenarios (useful for teaching, less emotional impact)

Evaluation criteria:
- Does it clearly illustrate the key message?
- Is it appropriate for this audience and context?
- Do you have the right to tell this story?
- Is the specificity level right (not too abstract, not too detailed)?
- Does it have natural conflict and resolution?
- Can you tell it authentically?

### Step 3: Structure the narrative arc
Shape the story using proven narrative structure:

CLASSIC ARC (works for most stories):
1. HOOK: Grab attention in the first line (not "So, one time...")
2. SETUP: Establish character, context, and stakes (who, where, what matters)
3. CONFLICT: Introduce the problem, challenge, or obstacle (stories need tension)
4. RISING ACTION: Show the struggle, the attempts, the journey
5. CLIMAX: The turning point, decision, or revelation
6. RESOLUTION: What happened as a result
7. LESSON: The meaning, connected to your key message (often implicit)

Alternative structures:
- STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result (good for professional stories)
- BEFORE/AFTER: Contrast state before and after the change
- IN MEDIA RES: Start in the middle of action, then explain
- NESTED: Story within a story for complex lessons

### Step 4: Add sensory and emotional details
Make the story vivid and emotionally resonant:

Sensory details:
- What did you SEE? (specific visual details, not generic)
- What did you HEAR? (dialogue, sounds, ambient noise)
- Physical sensations? (nervous stomach, racing heart, cold hands)

Emotional honesty:
- What were you actually feeling? (fear, doubt, excitement)
- What was at stake emotionally?
- Where is the vulnerability? (vulnerability creates connection)

Specific over generic:
- Names and places (not "a colleague" but "Sarah")
- Numbers and times ("3am" not "late at night")
- Exact dialogue (not "he said something like...")

Show don't tell:
- "My hands were shaking" not "I was nervous"
- "She turned and walked out" not "She was upset"
- Action and dialogue reveal character, not description

### Step 5: Craft the hook and the landing
The opening and closing are the most important parts:

HOOKS that work:
- Drop into action: "The phone rang at 3am and everything changed."
- Provocative statement: "I was wrong about everything."
- Question: "Have you ever had a moment that changed everything?"
- Sensory: "The fluorescent lights buzzed in the empty office."
- Contrast: "Two weeks earlier, I'd been celebrating."

HOOKS to avoid:
- "So, this one time..."
- "I want to tell you a story about..."
- "This is a funny story..." (don't preview, let them discover)
- Starting with backstory before the hook

LANDING the story:
- The lesson should emerge naturally from the story
- Don't over-explain ("The point of that story is...")
- Let there be a beat of silence after the climax
- Connect explicitly to the key message if needed
- Strong final line that resonates

### Step 6: Adjust for time and context
Create versions of different lengths and contexts:

30-second version (elevator):
- Hook + core conflict + resolution + lesson
- Cut all but essential details

2-minute version (standard):
- Full arc with key details
- Most common for meetings and presentations

5-minute version (keynote):
- Full sensory details and emotional journey
- Multiple beats and subsidiary tensions

Context adjustments:
- Written vs spoken (written can have more detail, spoken needs more beats)
- Formal vs informal (adjust language and vulnerability level)
- Large audience vs small (large needs bigger gestures, clearer structure)
- Known audience vs strangers (adjust how much context to provide)

### Step 7: Practice and refine
Stories get better every time you tell them:

Practice method:
1. Tell it out loud (not just in your head)
2. Record yourself and listen back
3. Tell it to someone and watch their reactions
4. Note which parts land, which fall flat
5. Refine language, cut dead weight
6. Practice the hook until it's automatic

Refinement questions:
- Where do people's eyes light up? (keep those parts)
- Where do they check their phone? (cut or revise)
- What questions do they ask? (add that context)
- Does the ending land? (adjust the landing)

Signs the story is ready:
- You can tell it without notes
- The hook comes out smoothly every time
- You enjoy telling it (energy matters)
- People remember it and reference it later


## When to Use
- Making a point memorable in a presentation or meeting
- Inspiring teams during change or uncertainty
- Building culture by sharing organizational values in action
- Pitching ideas where emotional connection matters
- Teaching concepts through concrete examples
- Building rapport and trust with new relationships
- Sharing lessons learned without lecturing
- Making data and statistics meaningful
- Persuading when logic alone isn't working
- Creating content that spreads and resonates

## Verification
- Story directly supports the key message (not tangential)
- Has clear narrative arc (hook, conflict, resolution, meaning)
- Contains specific sensory and emotional details
- Hook grabs attention in the first sentence
- Includes authentic vulnerability (not posturing)
- Landing connects to the key message without over-explaining
- Appropriate length for context
- Practiced out loud and refined
