# Proactive Question Rotation

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

A 24-week rotating list of questions for weekly review. Each week, engage with one question from the current category. After cycling through all categories, start again.

Categories cover: Situation, Goals, Strategy, Values, Action, and Meta. The rotation ensures systematic coverage of all important domains without overwhelming any single review session.

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine Current Week
1. What week number are we in? (1-24, cycling)
2. Which category does this week fall in?
3. What is this week's specific question?

**Rotation schedule:**
| Week | Category | Question |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Situation | What has changed in my environment since last review? |
| 2 | Goals | Are my current goals still the right goals? |
| 3 | Strategy | Is my current approach working? What's the evidence? |
| 4 | Values | Am I spending time on what I say matters most? |
| 5 | Action | What am I avoiding that I know I should do? |
| 6 | Meta | Am I asking the right questions? What am I not asking? |
| 7 | Situation | What threats or opportunities am I not seeing? |
| 8 | Goals | Which goal, if achieved, would make the others easier? |
| 9 | Strategy | What would I do differently if I started over today? |
| 10 | Values | Where am I compromising my values? Is it justified? |
| 11 | Action | What's the highest-leverage action I could take this week? |
| 12 | Meta | What assumptions am I making that I haven't tested? |
| 13 | Situation | What do others see about my situation that I don't? |
| 14 | Goals | What goal have I been pursuing out of inertia rather than conviction? |
| 15 | Strategy | What resources am I underutilizing? |
| 16 | Values | If I could only keep 3 commitments, which would they be? |
| 17 | Action | What have I been planning to do "someday" that I should either schedule or drop? |
| 18 | Meta | What feedback have I been ignoring or dismissing? |
| 19 | Situation | What's working well that I should protect and not accidentally break? |
| 20 | Goals | What would make me change my goals? Has that happened? |
| 21 | Strategy | Where am I over-investing for diminishing returns? |
| 22 | Values | What would I regret NOT doing if I looked back in 5 years? |
| 23 | Action | What's one thing I could stop doing to free up capacity? |
| 24 | Meta | How has my thinking changed in the last 6 months? What caused the change? |

### Step 2: Engage with the Question
1. Read the question
2. Set a timer for 15-30 minutes
3. Write freely in response — don't filter or organize
4. Look for surprises — anything unexpected in your answer is valuable

### Step 3: Extract Actionable Insights
From your free-write:
1. What did you learn that you didn't already know?
2. What action does this suggest?
3. Is there a decision to make?
4. Does this connect to answers from previous weeks?

### Step 4: Connect to Previous Cycles
If you have answers from the same question in previous cycles:
1. Compare current answer to previous — what changed?
2. Did you act on previous insights? What happened?
3. Are there patterns across cycles?
4. Are you seeing the same issue repeatedly? (If so, escalate — it's not getting solved by reflection alone)

### Step 5: Record and Plan
```
WEEKLY REVIEW — Week [N] of 24
Category: [Situation/Goals/Strategy/Values/Action/Meta]
Question: [this week's question]

Response summary: [key points from free-write]

Insights:
1. [insight]
2. [insight]

Actions:
- [ ] [specific action with deadline]

Connections to previous reviews:
- [link to related past insights]

Pattern alerts: [recurring themes across cycles]
```

### Step 6: Apply to Input
If the input specifies a particular question, topic, or context:
1. Use that as the focus instead of the rotation schedule
2. Still follow Steps 2-5
3. Note which category it falls into

If the input asks to review the system itself:
1. Are any categories consistently producing insights? (Keep emphasizing)
2. Are any categories consistently empty? (Revise those questions)
3. Are there important questions missing? (Add to rotation)

## When to Use
- Weekly personal or project review
- When feeling directionless and needing structured reflection
- When wanting to ensure systematic coverage of all life/work domains
- → INVOKE: /wr (weekly review) for the broader review process

## Verification
- [ ] Current week/question identified
- [ ] Question genuinely engaged with (not just skimmed)
- [ ] Actionable insights extracted
- [ ] Connected to previous cycle answers if available
- [ ] Specific actions identified with deadlines
