# Systematic Variation (SCAMPER)

## Overview
SCAMPER is an acronym for 7 transformation operations:
- Substitute
- Combine
- Adapt
- Modify/Magnify/Minimize
- Put to other uses
- Eliminate
- Reverse/Rearrange

Apply each operation to generate variations, then evaluate.

## Goal
Generate variations of an existing solution by systematically applying
each transformation operation. No creativity needed - just apply
each operation mechanically.

## Steps

### Step 1: Describe Current Solution
Document the current solution and its components.
Break it down into parts that can be individually varied.

**Output**: Solution description with component list

### Step 2: Apply SUBSTITUTE
For each component, ask: What can be substituted?
- Different materials?
- Different components?
- Different people/roles?
- Different process?
- Different place?
- Different time?

**Output**: List of substitution variations

### Step 3: Apply COMBINE
Ask: What can be combined?
- Combine with another product?
- Combine functions?
- Combine materials?
- Combine steps?
- Combine with competitor's approach?

**Output**: List of combination variations

### Step 4: Apply ADAPT
Ask: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
- What else is like this?
- What ideas from other fields apply?
- What from nature could be copied?
- What from history could be revived?
- What from other industries?

**Output**: List of adaptation variations

### Step 5: Apply MODIFY/MAGNIFY/MINIMIZE
Ask: What can be modified?
- Make it bigger/smaller?
- Make it faster/slower?
- Make it stronger/lighter?
- Change color, shape, form?
- Exaggerate a feature?
- Minimize a feature?

**Output**: List of modification variations

### Step 6: Apply PUT TO OTHER USES
Ask: What other uses could this have?
- Use in different context?
- Use by different user?
- Use for different problem?
- Use at different scale?
- Use in different industry?

**Output**: List of alternative use variations

### Step 7: Apply ELIMINATE
Ask: What can be eliminated?
- Remove a component?
- Remove a step?
- Remove a feature?
- Remove complexity?
- Remove a constraint?
- What's not actually necessary?

**Output**: List of elimination variations

### Step 8: Apply REVERSE/REARRANGE
Ask: What can be reversed or rearranged?
- Reverse the order?
- Reverse the direction?
- Swap components?
- Change the sequence?
- Turn inside out?
- Do the opposite?

**Output**: List of reversal variations

### Step 9: Compile All Variations
List all generated variations.
Remove duplicates.
Group similar variations.

**Output**: Master variation list

### Step 10: Evaluate Variations
For each variation, quick assessment:
- Feasible? (Yes/No/Maybe)
- Valuable? (Better than current? How?)
- Worth exploring? (Yes/No)

**Output**: Evaluated variations

### Step 11: Select Promising Variations
Select variations marked as feasible AND valuable AND worth pursuing.
Rank by potential impact.

**Output**: Shortlist for further development


## When to Use
- Improving existing solution
- Generating alternatives
- Breaking out of fixation on current approach
- Brainstorming systematically
- Innovation on existing product/process

## Verification
- All 7 SCAMPER operations were applied
- Each operation generated at least 2 variations
- Variations are genuinely different from current solution
- Evaluation criteria were applied consistently
- Promising variations are feasible and valuable
