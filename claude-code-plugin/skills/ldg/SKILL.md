# Luck Dependent Goals

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Some goals depend on factors outside your control — timing, other people's decisions, market conditions, discovery, being in the right place. This procedure separates controllable from uncontrollable, maximizes what you can control, creates multiple chances for luck to strike, and builds resilience against bad luck.

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess the Luck Component
1. State the goal
2. What factors are within your control?
3. What factors are outside your control (luck-dependent)?
4. Estimate the split: what % is skill/effort vs % is luck?
5. What kind of luck is needed?
   - **Timing luck**: being in the right place at the right time
   - **Discovery luck**: finding something you couldn't have predicted
   - **People luck**: the right person noticing/helping
   - **Market luck**: conditions being favorable
   - **Random luck**: pure chance events

### Step 2: Maximize Controllable Factors
1. For each controllable factor, ask: am I doing everything I can?
2. Optimize preparation: when luck strikes, are you ready to capitalize?
3. Build skill: the more skilled you are, the less luck you need
4. Increase quality: better work increases the probability of favorable outcomes
5. Remove controllable obstacles that would prevent success even with luck

### Step 3: Create Multiple Shots on Goal
Luck favors frequency. Single attempts are gambling; multiple attempts are strategy.
1. How many independent attempts can you create?
2. Can you pursue parallel paths to the same goal?
3. Can you reframe to allow partial success?
4. Expected attempts to succeed = 1 / probability per attempt
5. Are you prepared for the number of attempts this realistically requires?

### Step 4: Increase Surface Area for Luck
1. **Network broadly**: more connections = more chances for people luck
2. **Be visible**: share your work, your goals, your needs
3. **Stay in the game**: persistence keeps you eligible for luck
4. **Be in motion**: luck finds moving targets more than stationary ones
5. **Stay curious**: discovery luck favors those who explore widely

### Step 5: Build Resilience Against Bad Luck
1. What's the worst-case scenario?
2. Can you survive it? (financially, emotionally, professionally)
3. Don't bet everything on one lucky break
4. Maintain a baseline: even with bad luck, these things are still true
5. Set a stop-loss: at what point do you accept this goal needs luck you're not getting?

### Step 6: Adjust Expectations and Commit
1. Given the luck component, what's a realistic timeline?
2. Luck-dependent goals take longer than skill-dependent ones — are you patient enough?
3. Can you enjoy the process regardless of the luck outcome?
4. Commit to the controllable actions, detach from the uncontrollable outcomes

LUCK ANALYSIS:
Goal: [statement]
Controllable: [% and factors]
Luck-dependent: [% and type]

Controllable optimizations:
1. [action to maximize skill/preparation]
2. [action to remove obstacles]

Multiple shots:
- Parallel paths: [N]
- Required attempts (estimated): [N]

Surface area expansion:
- [specific actions to increase luck exposure]

Resilience:
- Worst case: [scenario]
- Survivable: [yes/no]
- Stop-loss: [condition]

Realistic timeline: [estimate accounting for luck]
```

## When to Use
- Career goals (promotions, breakthroughs, being discovered)
- Creative goals (publishing, viral content, recognition)
- Business goals (finding customers, investors, partners)
- Any goal where "being in the right place at the right time" matters

## Verification
- [ ] Controllable vs uncontrollable clearly separated
- [ ] Controllable factors fully optimized
- [ ] Multiple attempts/paths created
- [ ] Surface area for luck expanded
- [ ] Resilience against bad luck built
- [ ] Realistic timeline set
