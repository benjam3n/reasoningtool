# Metaphor Method

## Overview
A systematic method for using metaphors to:
- Discover relationships that aren't obvious
- Generate new perspectives on problems
- Test whether discovered relationships are valid
- Extract abstract structures that apply across domains

## Core Principle
Metaphors are not just decorative language. They reveal structural
similarities between domains. By mapping from one domain to another,
we can discover relationships that transfer.

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify the target domain
What are you trying to understand better?
This is the LITERAL domain you want insight into.

Example: "Philosophical conclusions"

**Output**: target_domain

### Step 2: Find a source metaphor
What is the target domain LIKE?
Find a different domain that has structural similarities.

Good source metaphors:
- Are familiar (you know them well)
- Have clear structure (relationships are obvious)
- Are different enough to provide new perspective

Example: "Conclusions are like movie endings"

**Output**: source_metaphor

### Step 3: Map relationships from source
In the source domain, what relationships exist?
List them without yet checking if they apply to target.

Example (movie endings):
- Ending only makes sense given the plot
- Plot is driven by character motivations
- Good endings resolve tensions set up earlier
- Bad endings feel arbitrary

**Output**: source_relationships

### Step 4: Translate to target domain
For each source relationship, what's the equivalent in target?
Don't force it - some may not translate.

Example translations:
- "Ending → plot" becomes "conclusion → argument"
- "Character motivations" becomes "goals/problems"
- "Resolve tensions" becomes "solve problems set up"
- "Arbitrary endings" becomes "arbitrary conclusions"

**Output**: translated_relationships

### Step 5: Test translations
For each translated relationship, ask:
- Is this actually true in the target domain?
- Can I find examples that confirm it?
- Can I find counterexamples?

Keep relationships that pass testing.
Discard or modify those that don't.

**Output**: tested_relationships

### Step 6: Extract abstract structure
For relationships that survive testing, what's the abstract structure?
This is the pattern that applies to BOTH domains.

Example:
"Terminal points (endings/conclusions) are evaluated relative to
 their trajectory (plot/argument) and driving forces (motivations/goals)"

This abstract structure is the real insight.

**Output**: abstract_structure

### Step 7: Apply to new metaphors (iterate)
Take the abstract structure and find OTHER metaphors that instantiate it.
This tests the structure's generality and may reveal new aspects.

Example: Journey metaphor also has terminal point (destination),
trajectory (route), and driving forces (reasons for travel).

What new relationships does the journey metaphor reveal?

**Output**: iterated_insights
