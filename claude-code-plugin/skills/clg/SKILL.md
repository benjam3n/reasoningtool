# Collective and Movement Goals Handler

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Handler for goals that require building collectives, communities, or movements. These are distinct from relationship goals (dyadic/small group) and multi-party goals (navigating existing institutions). Collective goals are about CREATING new coordination among strangers.

## Steps

### Step 1: Classify the Collective Goal
| Type | Core Challenge | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Community | Getting people to belong and participate | Online forum, local group |
| Movement | Getting people to act toward shared cause | Activism, advocacy |
| Audience | Getting people to pay attention | Content, thought leadership |
| Network | Getting people to connect to each other | Professional network, ecosystem |
| Market | Getting people to transact | Marketplace, platform |

### Step 2: Define the Value Proposition
Why would a stranger join/participate?

1. **What do members GET?** (Value received)
   - Connection, information, status, opportunities, belonging, fun, meaning
2. **What do members GIVE?** (Cost of participation)
   - Time, attention, money, effort, data, vulnerability
3. **Is the value immediate or delayed?**
   - Immediate: people join and get value right away
   - Delayed: value comes after critical mass (harder to bootstrap)
4. **Is the value competitive or cooperative?**
   - Competitive: members compete for scarce resource
   - Cooperative: members create value for each other

### Step 3: Solve the Cold Start Problem
Every collective faces: "Why join when no one else has?"

**Bootstrap strategies:**
| Strategy | How It Works | Best For |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Single-player value | Useful even with 0 other members | Tools, content platforms |
| Seed with creators | Recruit content/value producers first | Media, marketplaces |
| Exclusive launch | Scarcity creates desire to join | Status-oriented communities |
| Event-based | Gather around a shared experience | Local communities, movements |
| Celebrity/influencer | Borrow someone else's audience | Broad-appeal communities |
| Solve a pain point | People join to fix an immediate problem | Support groups, utilities |

### Step 4: Design for Growth
How does the collective grow beyond the initial seed?

**Growth mechanisms:**
1. **Network effects**: Each new member makes it more valuable for existing members
2. **Viral loops**: Members naturally invite others (sharing, referral, collaboration)
3. **Content**: Public content attracts new members via search/social
4. **Events**: Regular events create moments of entry
5. **Word of mouth**: Members tell others because of genuine enthusiasm

**Growth blockers to avoid:**
- High barriers to entry (too many steps, too much info required)
- No visible activity (ghost town effect)
- Insider culture that excludes newcomers
- No clear "what do I do first?"

### Step 5: Design for Retention
Growth without retention is a leaky bucket.

1. **First experience**: What happens in the first 5 minutes? (Must be positive)
2. **Habit loop**: What brings people back regularly?
3. **Investment**: What do members build that they'd lose if they left? (Profile, reputation, relationships)
4. **Progression**: Is there a path from newcomer to core member?
5. **Belonging signals**: How do members know they're "in"?

### Step 6: Design Governance
As collectives grow, governance becomes critical:

| Size | Governance Style | Key Challenge |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| < 50 | Informal, founder-led | Maintaining culture |
| 50-500 | Documented norms, moderators | Scaling culture |
| 500-5000 | Formal rules, elected leaders | Preventing fragmentation |
| 5000+ | Institutional structures | Preventing capture |

**Key governance decisions:**
- Who can join? (Open vs closed vs curated)
- Who can speak/post? (Moderation policy)
- Who makes rules? (Autocratic vs democratic vs consensus)
- How are conflicts resolved? (Process)
- How are bad actors handled? (Enforcement)

### Step 7: Report
```
COLLECTIVE GOAL ANALYSIS:
Type: [community/movement/audience/network/market]
Value proposition: Members get [X] by giving [Y]

Cold start strategy: [bootstrap approach]
Growth mechanism: [how it spreads]
Retention design: [what keeps people]
Governance: [how it's managed]

Key metrics:
- Members: [total, active, growth rate]
- Engagement: [participation rate]
- Retention: [30-day, 90-day]
- Value: [are members getting what was promised?]

Biggest risk: [most likely failure mode]
Next milestone: [specific target]
```

## When to Use
- Goal requires many strangers to coordinate
- Building something that scales beyond personal relationships
- Creating culture, norms, identity for a group
- → INVOKE: /net (networking) for building initial connections
- → INVOKE: /vm (viral mechanics) for growth design
- → INVOKE: /sms (social media) for platform-specific tactics

## Verification
- [ ] Collective type identified
- [ ] Value proposition clear (what members get AND give)
- [ ] Cold start strategy defined
- [ ] Growth mechanism beyond direct recruitment
- [ ] Retention designed (not just acquisition)
- [ ] Governance appropriate to size
