# Economic Research

## Overview
Systematic analysis of economic viability, cost structures, and comparative advantage

## Steps

### Step 1: Framework selection
Choose appropriate analytical frameworks for the question:

FOR INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:
- Porter's Five Forces: Competitive dynamics assessment
  * Supplier power, buyer power, threat of entry, substitutes, rivalry
- Value chain analysis: Where value is created/captured
  * Primary activities, support activities, margin analysis
- Comparative advantage: Why here vs. elsewhere
  * Factor conditions, demand conditions, related industries, strategy

FOR VIABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Cost-benefit analysis: Total costs vs. total benefits
- Break-even analysis: Volume/price needed for profitability
- Sensitivity analysis: How outcomes change with key variables
- Total cost of ownership: Full lifecycle costs

FOR POLICY ANALYSIS:
- Economic impact assessment: Jobs, GDP, tax revenue
- Multiplier effects: Direct, indirect, induced impacts
- Distributional analysis: Who benefits, who bears costs

Select 2-3 frameworks most relevant to the question.

### Step 2: Data collection
Gather relevant economic data systematically:

GOVERNMENT STATISTICS:
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Wages, employment, productivity
- Census Bureau: Industry statistics, trade data
- Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): GDP, input-output tables
- International: OECD, World Bank, IMF databases

INDUSTRY SOURCES:
- IBISWorld, Statista: Industry reports and market data
- Trade associations: Industry-specific statistics
- Company filings: Public company financials (10-K, earnings)

ACADEMIC/RESEARCH:
- NBER working papers: Economic research
- Federal Reserve: Regional economic data
- Think tanks: Policy research and analysis

KEY DATA TYPES TO COLLECT:
- Cost structures: Labor, materials, energy, capital, logistics
- Market data: Size, growth, segments, pricing
- Trade flows: Imports, exports, tariffs
- Productivity: Output per worker, efficiency metrics
- Comparative data: Across geographies, time periods, competitors

Document data sources, dates, and any quality concerns.

### Step 3: Cost structure analysis
Break down and compare cost components:

DIRECT COSTS:
- Labor: Wages, benefits, payroll taxes
  * Include productivity adjustments (output per hour)
- Materials: Raw materials, components, packaging
  * Include quality differences and waste rates
- Energy: Electricity, fuel, utilities
  * Include reliability and price volatility

INDIRECT COSTS:
- Capital: Equipment, facilities, depreciation
  * Include financing costs and utilization rates
- Logistics: Transportation, warehousing, inventory
  * Include lead times and supply chain risks
- Regulatory: Compliance, permits, environmental
  * Include uncertainty and change risk
- Overhead: Management, support functions, IT

HIDDEN/OFTEN-MISSED COSTS:
- Quality costs: Defects, rework, warranty
- Coordination costs: Managing distant operations
- IP protection: Risks and mitigation costs
- Currency risk: Exchange rate exposure
- Inventory carrying: Working capital tied up

Compare across:
- Geographies (domestic vs. foreign alternatives)
- Time periods (historical trends, future projections)
- Competitors (relative cost position)

### Step 4: Market dynamics analysis
Analyze supply and demand factors:

DEMAND SIDE:
- Market size: Current and projected (units, dollars)
- Growth drivers: What's driving demand up/down
- Customer segments: Who buys, different needs/willingness to pay
- Price sensitivity: Elasticity, value vs. price competition
- Demand stability: Cyclicality, seasonality, volatility

SUPPLY SIDE:
- Current capacity: Existing production capacity utilization
- Competitor landscape: Major players, market shares, strategies
- Barriers to entry: Capital, technology, regulation, relationships
- Supply chain: Key suppliers, concentration, dependencies
- Capacity trends: New entrants, expansions, exits

MARKET DYNAMICS:
- Competitive intensity: How fierce is competition
- Pricing power: Can you set prices or are you price-taker
- Technology disruption: Emerging technologies that could change market
- Regulatory changes: Policy shifts affecting market
- Substitution risk: Alternative products/solutions

Apply Porter's Five Forces if selected in Step 1.

### Step 5: Comparative advantage assessment
Evaluate competitive positioning using Diamond Model:

FACTOR CONDITIONS:
- Natural resources: Raw material availability and cost
- Human resources: Skilled labor availability, education, training
- Knowledge resources: R&D capabilities, innovation infrastructure
- Capital resources: Access to financing, investment
- Infrastructure: Transportation, communications, utilities

DEMAND CONDITIONS:
- Domestic market: Size, sophistication, growth
- Customer expectations: Quality standards, innovation demands
- Early adopter presence: Lead users driving innovation

RELATED/SUPPORTING INDUSTRIES:
- Supplier ecosystem: Proximity and capability of suppliers
- Complementary industries: Supporting services and products
- Cluster effects: Agglomeration benefits

FIRM STRATEGY AND RIVALRY:
- Competitive intensity: Local competition driving improvement
- Management practices: Quality of business leadership
- Investment orientation: Long-term vs. short-term focus

GOVERNMENT AND CHANCE:
- Policy environment: Supportive vs. restrictive policies
- Trade policy: Tariffs, agreements, barriers
- Stability: Political and economic predictability

Compare positioning across alternatives.

### Step 6: Scenario modeling
Model outcomes under different assumptions:

BASE CASE:
- Most likely assumptions
- Expected values for key variables
- Probability-weighted expectations
- Result: Expected outcome

OPTIMISTIC CASE:
- Favorable conditions (top 10-20% outcomes)
- What would have to go right
- Assumptions: Strong demand, lower costs, supportive policy
- Result: Upside potential

PESSIMISTIC CASE:
- Unfavorable conditions (bottom 10-20% outcomes)
- What could go wrong
- Assumptions: Weak demand, cost overruns, adverse policy
- Result: Downside risk

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:
- Which variables matter most?
- How much does outcome change with each?
- What are the break-even points?
- Which assumptions are most uncertain?

KEY VARIABLES TO TEST:
- Demand growth rate
- Key input costs (labor, materials, energy)
- Exchange rates (if international)
- Capacity utilization
- Pricing/margin assumptions
- Policy/regulatory changes

Build simple financial model if appropriate.

### Step 7: Synthesis and recommendation
Integrate findings into actionable conclusions:

1. KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
   - What did each analysis reveal?
   - What are the most important data points?
   - What surprised us or challenged assumptions?

2. VIABILITY ASSESSMENT
   - Viable: Positive economics under realistic assumptions
   - Marginal: Viable only with specific conditions or investments
   - Not viable: Negative economics unlikely to be overcome

3. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
   - What must be true for success?
   - What investments or changes are required?
   - What external conditions are needed?

4. KEY RISKS
   - Biggest threats to viability
   - Probability and impact of each
   - Mitigation strategies available

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Proceed: Move forward with identified investments/conditions
   - Modify: Adjust scope, timing, or approach
   - Abandon: Do not pursue, economics unfavorable
   - Investigate: Need more information before deciding

6. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   - How confident are we in the analysis?
   - What would change the conclusion?
   - What additional research would help?

Document all assumptions explicitly.
