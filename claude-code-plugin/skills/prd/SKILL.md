# Presentation Design

## Overview
Systematic procedure for designing visually effective presentations, slides, and handouts that enhance rather than compete with your message

## Steps

### Step 1: Define design requirements
Before designing, understand what the visuals need to accomplish:

Audience analysis:
1. What is their visual literacy level?
2. What design conventions do they expect?
3. Will they see this once (presentation) or refer back (handout)?
4. Are there accessibility considerations?

Context analysis:
1. Room size and screen configuration?
2. Lighting conditions?
3. Virtual vs in-person?
4. Will people be close or far from screen?

Content requirements:
1. How many main sections?
2. What types of content (concepts, data, processes, comparisons)?
3. Are there complex ideas that need visual explanation?
4. Is there data that needs visualization?

Constraints:
1. Brand guidelines or templates required?
2. Format requirements (aspect ratio, file type)?
3. Accessibility requirements?
4. Time available for design?

### Step 2: Plan the visual structure
Map content to visual treatment:

Content-to-visual mapping:
1. Title slides: For section breaks and major transitions
2. Concept slides: Single ideas that need illustration
3. Data slides: Numbers that need visualization
4. Process slides: Sequences or workflows
5. Comparison slides: Contrasting options or before/after
6. Image slides: Full-bleed images for emotional impact
7. Blank slides: Strategic pauses where you want attention on you

Slide count estimation:
- 1-2 slides per minute of talking (maximum)
- Better to have fewer, more impactful slides
- Account for transition slides and pauses

Visual narrative:
- How does the visual journey support the story?
- Where are the high-impact moments?
- What visual motifs or metaphors could unify the deck?

### Step 3: Establish visual design system
Create consistent design elements:

Color palette:
- Primary color (1): For emphasis and key elements
- Secondary color (1-2): For supporting elements
- Neutral colors: For text and backgrounds
- Accent color (1): For calls to action or highlights
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Consider color blindness (don't rely on red/green alone)

Typography:
- Headline font: Bold, readable from distance
- Body font: Clean, professional, readable
- Maximum 2 font families
- Minimum sizes: Headlines 32pt+, body 24pt+
- Consistent hierarchy across slides

Layout grid:
- Consistent margins (generous - use whitespace)
- Alignment guides for elements
- Consistent placement of recurring elements (logo, page numbers)

Visual elements:
- Icon style (line, filled, consistent style)
- Image treatment (full bleed, contained, filtered)
- Chart style (colors, labels, legends)
- Transition style (simple, consistent)

### Step 4: Design slide layouts
Create or select slide templates for each content type:

Title slide:
- Presentation title (large, prominent)
- Subtitle or tagline
- Presenter name and context
- Minimal, impactful visual

Section break slide:
- Section title only
- Strong visual impact
- Signals transition to audience

Concept slide (most common):
- One idea, one visual
- Text: 6 words or fewer
- Large image or simple diagram
- Whitespace to let idea breathe

Data slide:
- One chart or visualization per slide
- Clear headline stating the insight (not "Q3 Sales" but "Sales grew 40%")
- Minimal labels, no chartjunk
- Call out the key data point visually

Comparison slide:
- Clear two-column or before/after structure
- Parallel construction
- Visual distinction between options

Quote slide:
- Quote in large text
- Attribution smaller
- Simple, minimal design

Image slide:
- Full-bleed high-quality image
- Minimal or no text overlay
- Use for emotional impact or transitions

### Step 5: Design data visualizations
Create clear, honest, impactful data displays:

Choose the right chart:
- Comparison: Bar chart (horizontal for many items)
- Change over time: Line chart
- Part of whole: Pie (limit to 3-5 slices) or stacked bar
- Relationship: Scatter plot
- Distribution: Histogram

Data visualization principles:
1. Start axis at zero (unless misleading not to)
2. Label directly, avoid legends when possible
3. Remove chartjunk (gridlines, 3D effects, unnecessary decoration)
4. Highlight the insight, not just the data
5. Use color strategically to draw attention
6. Make the headline the insight ("Sales grew 40%" not "Q3 Sales")

Avoid:
- 3D charts (distort perception)
- Dual Y-axes (confusing)
- Too many data series (simplify)
- Truncated axes that exaggerate differences
- Pie charts with too many slices

Accessibility:
- Don't rely on color alone (use patterns or labels)
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Provide alt text descriptions

### Step 6: Build the slides
Execute the design for each slide:

Building process:
1. Start with template/layout for slide type
2. Add content following design system
3. Apply one-idea-per-slide rule ruthlessly
4. Replace text with visuals wherever possible
5. Check readability at actual viewing size
6. Ensure consistency with design system

Slide-by-slide checklist:
- Is there only ONE idea on this slide?
- Could this be an image instead of text?
- Is text under 6 words?
- Is it readable from the back of the room?
- Does it follow the design system?
- Does the headline state an insight/claim (not just a topic)?

Text reduction techniques:
- Bullet points to single headline
- Paragraphs to key phrase
- Lists to icons with labels
- Tables to simplified charts
- Text to visual metaphor

Animation guidelines:
- Use sparingly and purposefully
- Simple transitions only (no spinning text)
- Build sequences can reveal complexity gradually
- Avoid animation that competes with your words

### Step 7: Create supporting materials
Design handouts or leave-behind documents:

Handout purposes:
- Reference during presentation (brief, follow-along)
- Reference after presentation (detailed, standalone)
- Pre-reading before presentation (context setting)

Handout design principles:
- Handouts are DOCUMENTS, not printed slides
- Include detail that slides deliberately exclude
- Can stand alone without presenter
- Include sources, references, next steps
- Design for reading, not projecting

What to include:
- Summary of key points
- Detailed data and analysis
- References and sources
- Contact information and next steps
- Space for notes if used during presentation

When to distribute:
- Before: If they need context or will take notes
- After: If you want attention on you during talk
- During: Only if they need to reference specific content

### Step 8: Review and refine
Quality check the complete design:

Visual review:
1. View at actual presentation size
2. Step back - is it readable from distance?
3. Squint test - do key elements stand out?
4. Consistency check - does design system hold throughout?
5. Flow check - does visual narrative work?

Content review:
1. One idea per slide?
2. Text minimal enough?
3. Headlines state insights, not just topics?
4. Data visualizations clear and honest?
5. Could you present without slides?

Technical review:
1. File size acceptable?
2. Fonts embedded?
3. Links working?
4. Compatible with presentation system?
5. Backup formats available?

Accessibility review:
1. Color contrast sufficient?
2. Not relying on color alone?
3. Alt text for images?
4. Readable fonts and sizes?


## When to Use
- Creating slides for any presentation or talk
- Designing pitch decks for investors or clients
- Building executive briefing materials
- Preparing conference or meetup presentations
- Creating training materials with visual aids
- Designing data-heavy presentations that need clarity
- Building leave-behind documents or handouts
- Creating video presentation visuals

## Verification
- Every slide has one clear idea only
- Text is 6 words or fewer (except quotes)
- Readable from the back of the room (32pt+ headlines, 24pt+ body)
- Design system applied consistently throughout
- Data visualizations show insight, not just data
- Presentation can be delivered without slides if needed
- Accessibility requirements met (contrast, alt text)
- Technical requirements met (format, size, compatibility)
