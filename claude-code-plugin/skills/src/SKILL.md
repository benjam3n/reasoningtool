# Source Credibility Assessment

## Overview
Procedure for evaluating the credibility and reliability of any information source

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify source type
Classify the source to determine appropriate evaluation criteria:

Source types:
- Academic paper: Peer-reviewed journal article, conference paper
- News article: Journalism from news organizations
- Website/blog: General web content, organizational sites
- Social media: Posts, threads, viral content
- Expert opinion: Statements from subject matter experts
- Government/official: Government publications, official statistics
- Book: Published books (academic or popular)
- Report: Think tank, NGO, or industry reports

Note: Some sources span multiple types (e.g., academic blog)

### Step 2: Conduct lateral reading
Research the source itself rather than just reading its claims:

1. Open new browser tabs/searches
2. Search for the author/organization name
3. Look for:
   - Who they are (credentials, affiliation)
   - What others say about them
   - Any known biases or controversies
   - Track record of accuracy
   - Funding sources or financial interests
4. Check independent assessments:
   - For news: Media Bias/Fact Check, AllSides, NewsGuard
   - For academics: Institution reputation, h-index
   - For websites: WHOIS, domain age, traffic data

Key question: What do OTHER sources say about THIS source?

### Step 3: Evaluate on five dimensions
Score the source on each dimension (1-10):

AUTHORITY (weight: 0.25)
- Who is the author/creator?
- What are their credentials?
- Are they recognized experts in this area?
- What institution are they affiliated with?
Red flags: Anonymous, no credentials, credentials in unrelated field

ACCURACY (weight: 0.25)
- Are claims supported by evidence?
- Are sources cited?
- Can claims be verified elsewhere?
- Is methodology sound (if research)?
Red flags: No citations, contradicts established facts, cherry-picked data

OBJECTIVITY (weight: 0.20)
- Is the purpose informational or persuasive?
- Are multiple perspectives presented?
- Is language neutral or loaded?
- Are conflicts of interest disclosed?
Red flags: Emotional language, one-sided, undisclosed conflicts

CURRENCY (weight: 0.15)
- When was this published?
- Has information been updated?
- Is this topic time-sensitive?
Red flags: Outdated in fast-moving field, cites superseded research

COVERAGE (weight: 0.15)
- How comprehensively is topic covered?
- Are limitations acknowledged?
- Are counterarguments addressed?
Red flags: Overgeneralizes, ignores contradicting evidence

### Step 4: Apply source-type specific checks
Apply additional criteria based on source type:

For ACADEMIC PAPERS:
- Peer-reviewed journal? Impact factor?
- Citation count? Highly cited or ignored?
- Methodology appropriate? Sample size adequate?
- Any retractions or corrections?
- Has it been replicated?

For NEWS ARTICLES:
- Reputable news organization with editorial standards?
- Bylined article with named journalist?
- Multiple sources quoted?
- Primary sources available?
- Separates news from opinion?

For WEBSITES:
- Who owns/operates the site? (check About page)
- Contact information available?
- Domain type (.gov, .edu, .org, .com)?
- Domain age and history? (WHOIS, Wayback Machine)

For SOCIAL MEDIA:
- Verified account?
- Account age and history?
- Does person exist offline?
- Is this firsthand or hearsay?
- Does original source exist?

For EXPERT OPINION:
- Expert in relevant field?
- Speaking within their expertise?
- Consensus or outlier view?
- Financial interests in position?

### Step 5: Verify key claims
Verify the most important claims using multiple techniques:

LATERAL READING:
- Leave the source, search for info ABOUT it
- What do independent sources say?

UPSTREAM VERIFICATION:
- Find the original source of claims
- Verify claim matches original context
- Check for context removed or distorted

CROSS-REFERENCE:
- Find 2-3 other sources for same claim
- Ensure they're truly independent (not circular)
- Compare details and note discrepancies

REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH (if images):
- Verify images are from when/where claimed
- Check for manipulation
- Find original context

Document verification status for each key claim:
- Verified: Confirmed by independent sources
- Partially verified: Some aspects confirmed
- Unverified: Cannot confirm or deny
- Contradicted: Independent sources disagree

### Step 6: Calculate credibility score
Compute weighted credibility score:

Formula:
Score = (Authority × 0.25) + (Accuracy × 0.25) + (Objectivity × 0.20)
        + (Currency × 0.15) + (Coverage × 0.15)

Interpretation:
- 8-10: High credibility - suitable as primary source
- 6-8: Moderate credibility - use with verification
- 4-6: Low credibility - use cautiously, verify all claims
- 1-4: Very low credibility - do not rely on

Adjust interpretation based on:
- Severity of red flags
- Verification results
- Source-type specific concerns
- Context of intended use

### Step 7: Document assessment and recommend use
Create final assessment record:

1. Source identification
   - Full citation/URL
   - Source type
   - Date assessed

2. Scores summary
   - Overall credibility score
   - Individual dimension scores
   - Red flags identified

3. Verification summary
   - Claims checked
   - Verification status
   - Concerns noted

4. Recommended use
   - Suitable as primary source? Citation?
   - What caveats should accompany use?
   - What additional verification needed?
   - Should this source be avoided?

5. Context notes
   - How this assessment might change with context
   - What would increase/decrease credibility


## When to Use
- Evaluating a claim or piece of information before acting on it
- Assessing reliability of a source for research or citation
- Fact-checking statements or statistics
- Building an evidence base for decision-making
- Encountering unfamiliar sources or outlets
- Verifying viral or widely-shared content
- Assessing expert opinions or recommendations
- Evaluating information in high-stakes contexts

## Verification
- Lateral reading conducted (searched for info ABOUT source)
- All five dimensions scored with documented rationale
- Source-type specific checks completed
- Key claims verification attempted
- Red flags explicitly documented
- Final score calculated correctly
- Recommended use is clear and justified
