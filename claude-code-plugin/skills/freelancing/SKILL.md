# Freelancing

## Overview
Comprehensive guide to building a sustainable freelance practice, from finding
clients to pricing, proposals, contracts, and ongoing client management.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define your offering
Get crystal clear on what you sell:

1. Identify your sellable skill:
   - What can you do that people pay for?
   - What's your unique combination of abilities?
   - What do people already ask you for help with?

2. Define the transformation:
   - What problem do you solve?
   - What does before/after look like?
   - What outcome do clients get?

3. Narrow your niche (initially):
   - Specific industry or company type
   - Specific problem or use case
   - Specific deliverable type
   - "Niching down" makes marketing easier

4. Articulate your positioning:
   - "I help [who] do [what] so they can [outcome]"
   - What makes you different from alternatives?
   - Why should someone hire you specifically?

5. Define your service packages:
   - What do you actually deliver?
   - What's included vs excluded?
   - What are the options (if any)?

### Step 2: Set your pricing
Determine how and what to charge:

1. Calculate your floor rate:
   Minimum viable rate =
   (Annual income need + business costs + taxes)
   ÷ billable hours available

   Example:
   - Need: $120K annual income
   - Costs: $20K (software, insurance, etc.)
   - Taxes: ~30% additional
   - Billable hours: 1,200/year (60% of 2,000)
   - Floor rate: ($120K + $20K) × 1.3 ÷ 1,200 = $152/hr

2. Research market rates:
   - What do others with similar skills charge?
   - What are clients paying for similar work?
   - What's the range (low, mid, high)?

3. Position your rate:
   - New freelancer: Start at market rate or slightly below
   - Experienced: At or above market rate
   - Specialized expert: Premium pricing

4. Choose pricing model:
   - Hourly: Good for starting, clear boundaries
   - Project: Better margins, clearer outcomes
   - Retainer: Predictable, requires trust
   - Value-based: Highest upside, hardest to sell

5. Build your rate card:
   - Primary rate for main service
   - Options for different scope levels
   - Rush fees for urgent work
   - Volume discounts if appropriate

6. Plan for rate increases:
   - Raise rates for new clients first
   - Annual increases for ongoing clients
   - Raise when demand exceeds capacity

### Step 3: Build your pipeline
Create system for finding clients:

1. Warm outreach (highest conversion):
   - Past employers who might hire you back
   - Former colleagues at other companies
   - Friends and family who can refer
   - Existing network who knows your work

2. Content and visibility:
   - Share expertise (blog, LinkedIn, Twitter)
   - Speak at events or podcasts
   - Build portfolio of case studies
   - Be findable for your specialty

3. Platforms and marketplaces:
   - Upwork, Toptal, Fiverr (varies by type)
   - Industry-specific platforms
   - Freelancer directories
   - Pros: Lead flow; Cons: Competition, fees

4. Outbound prospecting:
   - Identify target companies
   - Find decision makers
   - Personalized outreach
   - Follow up persistently (but not annoyingly)

5. Referral system:
   - Ask happy clients for referrals
   - Make it easy (specific ask, timing)
   - Consider referral incentives

6. Track your pipeline:
   - Lead source tracking
   - Conversion rates by source
   - Average deal size and close time
   - Focus on what's working

### Step 4: Qualify opportunities
Filter leads to focus on good fits:

1. Qualification criteria:

   - Can they afford your rates?
   - Is budget defined or unclear?
   - Are they shopping for cheapest?
