# Procedure Hierarchy

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Not all procedures are equal. There is a hierarchy:
- Meta-procedures constrain HOW reasoning happens
- Content procedures address WHAT to do in specific situations

Meta-procedures apply first, always, to everything.
Content procedures are invoked through meta-procedures, when appropriate.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Hierarchy Levels

**Level 0 — Foundational Axioms:**
- ARAW (Assume Right / Assume Wrong) — the core search pattern
- Universalize — extract complete structure from any input
- These are not optional; they define what "thinking well" means

**Level 1 — Meta-Procedures (HOW to reason):**
- Procedure validation (/pv) — is the procedure itself correct?
- Self-audit (sa-*) — am I applying procedures properly?
- Convergent validation (/cv) — are multiple methods agreeing?
- Unassailable output (/uo) — is the output defensible?
- Iteration (/iterate) — what needs improving?

**Level 2 — Category Procedures (WHAT type of problem):**
- /claim, /decide, /viability, /evaluate — classify and route
- /diagnose, /search, /want, /how — classify and route
- These determine which content procedures to invoke

**Level 3 — Content Procedures (HOW to handle specific problems):**
- /rca, /dcp, /cba, /ht — specific analytical tools
- /pw, /stl, /de — specific production tools
- These do the actual work on the actual problem

**Level 4 — Ordering Procedures (WHAT sequence):**
- /to, /gt, /rm — determine step execution order
- Applied within content procedures to sequence their steps

**Level 5 — Domain Procedures (SPECIFIC context):**
- /sdp, /ops, /api — domain-specific knowledge
- Only invoked when the problem is in that domain

### Step 2: Apply Hierarchy to Input
1. What is the input? (claim, decision, goal, problem, output, procedure, etc.)
2. Which hierarchy level is being asked about?
3. What does the hierarchy tell us about how to handle it?

### Step 3: Resolve Hierarchy Conflicts
When procedures at different levels give conflicting guidance:

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Meta says stop, content says continue | Meta wins — stop and investigate |
| Category routes to X, but Y seems better | Check: did category have all info? If yes, trust routing. If no, re-route |
| Content procedure skips validation | Insert validation — Level 1 always applies |
| Domain procedure contradicts general | Domain wins within its scope, general wins outside |
| Two same-level procedures conflict | Escalate to next higher level for resolution |

### Step 4: Check Procedure Placement
For any given procedure, verify it's at the right level:
1. Does it apply to ALL problems? → Level 0 or 1
2. Does it CLASSIFY problems? → Level 2
3. Does it SOLVE specific problem types? → Level 3
4. Does it SEQUENCE steps? → Level 4
5. Does it apply only in ONE domain? → Level 5

**Misplacement indicators:**
- A Level 3 procedure trying to override Level 1 → wrong, fix the procedure
- A Level 5 procedure used in all domains → promote to Level 3
- A Level 1 procedure that only applies sometimes → demote to Level 2 or 3

### Step 5: Report
```
PROCEDURE HIERARCHY ANALYSIS:
Input: [what was analyzed]
Relevant level: [which hierarchy level]

Hierarchy application:
- Level 0 (axioms): [how ARAW/U apply]
- Level 1 (meta): [which meta-procedures apply]
- Level 2 (category): [how input is classified]
- Level 3 (content): [which procedures handle it]
- Level 4 (ordering): [how steps are sequenced]
- Level 5 (domain): [domain-specific considerations]

Conflicts found: [any hierarchy conflicts and resolutions]
Misplacements found: [any procedures at wrong level]
```

## When to Use
- When unsure which procedure takes precedence
- When procedures give conflicting guidance
- When designing new procedures (to place them correctly)
- When auditing the procedure system

## Verification
- [ ] All hierarchy levels considered
- [ ] Meta-procedures given precedence over content
- [ ] Conflicts resolved by hierarchy rules
- [ ] No procedures operating above their level
