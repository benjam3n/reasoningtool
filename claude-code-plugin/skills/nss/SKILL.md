# Novelty Space Search

## Overview
Creativity = novelty + value.
This procedure separates the two:
1. Generate novelty (systematic combination, variation, import)
2. Filter for value (criteria-based selection)

By separating, we can be exhaustive in generation and rigorous in selection.

## Goal
Systematically generate novel ideas/possibilities,
then search for those that are valuable, feasible, and timely.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Innovation Space
Specify:
- What domain/problem
- What hard constraints
- What would make an idea valuable

**Output**: Innovation brief

### Step 2: List Existing Solutions
What already exists in this space?
These are the baseline to be more novel than.

**Output**: Existing solution inventory

### Step 3: Apply Combinatorial Generation
List key elements/components.
Systematically combine in new ways.

**Output**: Combinatorial ideas

### Step 4: Apply Attribute Variation
For existing solutions, vary each attribute.
Use SCAMPER or similar.

**Output**: Variation ideas

### Step 5: Apply Analogy Import
Search other domains for analogous problems.
Import their solutions.

**Output**: Imported ideas

### Step 6: Apply Constraint Removal
List assumed constraints.
Generate ideas that violate them.

**Output**: Constraint-free ideas

### Step 7: Apply Extreme Parameters
Push key parameters to extremes.
What does this enable?

**Output**: Extreme parameter ideas

### Step 8: Compile All Ideas
Combine all generated ideas.
Remove duplicates.
State each clearly.

**Output**: Master idea list

### Step 9: Quick Novelty Filter
For each idea, quick check:
- Already exists? → Remove
- Obvious? → Flag but keep

**Output**: Novel ideas

### Step 10: Score on Value Criteria
For each novel idea, score on criteria:
- Solves real problem
- Better than alternatives
- Technically feasible
- Resource feasible
- Right timing
- Sustainable advantage

**Output**: Scored ideas

### Step 11: Rank and Select
Rank by total score.
Select top ideas for further development.

**Output**: Promising ideas


## When to Use
- Innovation/ideation
- Finding new approaches
- Breaking out of local optimum
- Exploring possibility space
- Product/feature development

## Verification
- Multiple generation methods were applied
- Ideas are genuinely novel (not already done)
- Ideas address real problems
- Feasibility was honestly assessed
- Top ideas have clear next steps
