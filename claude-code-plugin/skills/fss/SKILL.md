# Future Space Search

## Overview
The future is uncertain but not arbitrary.
Systematically generate possible futures, then:
- Find most likely (prediction)
- Find most desirable (goal-setting)
- Find most important to prepare for (risk management)

## Goal
Generate a comprehensive space of possible futures,
then search for most likely, most desirable, or most important to prepare for.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Future Space
Specify:
- What domain/question
- What timeframe
- What you're optimizing for (likely/desirable/important)

**Output**: Future space definition

### Step 2: Identify Key Drivers
List the main forces that will shape this future:
- Technology changes
- Economic factors
- Social/demographic shifts
- Political/regulatory changes
- Environmental factors
- Competitive dynamics

**Output**: List of 3-7 key drivers

### Step 3: Generate Baseline Futures
Generate systematic combinations of driver states.
Use morphological approach if 3-5 drivers.

**Output**: Baseline future scenarios

### Step 4: Add Trend Extrapolations
For each major trend, generate:
- Continuation scenario
- Acceleration scenario
- Reversal scenario

**Output**: Trend-based futures

### Step 5: Add Wild Cards
Brainstorm low-probability high-impact events.
For each, describe the resulting future.

**Output**: Wild card futures

### Step 6: Filter Obviously Impossible
Remove futures that:
- Violate physical laws
- Are internally contradictory
- Require impossible sequences

**Output**: Plausible future set

### Step 7: Score Futures
Based on search goal, score each future:
- If seeking likely: use likelihood criteria
- If seeking desirable: use desirability criteria
- If seeking important: use impact criteria

**Output**: Scored futures

### Step 8: Select Target Futures
Select futures based on search goal:
- Most likely: top 3 by likelihood
- Most desirable: top 3 by desirability
- Highest impact: top 3 by impact
- Most different: pick diverse set for scenario planning

**Output**: Selected futures

### Step 9: Describe Selected Futures
For each selected future, write detailed description:
- What characterizes this future
- How we got there (causal path)
- Key indicators we'd see along the way
- Implications for us

**Output**: Future narratives


## When to Use
- Strategic planning
- Risk assessment
- Scenario planning
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Preparing for multiple outcomes

## Verification
- Key drivers were identified systematically
- Multiple generation methods were used
- Futures are internally consistent
- Scoring criteria match search goal
- Selected futures span important possibilities
- Futures have clear descriptions and implications
