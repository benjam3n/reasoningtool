# Learning Discovery Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

When the goal is understanding (not just completion), order work to maximize learning. Test assumptions early, validate incrementally, pursue the most informative experiments first.

## Core Principle

Do the thing that teaches you the most, not the thing that progresses the most. Early learning compounds.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Most Uncertain First
- Identify what you know least about
- Address the biggest knowledge gaps first
- **Why**: reducing uncertainty early prevents building on wrong assumptions

### Rule 2: Test Assumptions Before Building
- List assumptions your plan rests on
- Validate the riskiest assumptions before investing in execution
- **When**: new domain, unproven approach, high uncertainty

### Rule 3: Smallest Viable Experiment
- Design the cheapest test that gives the most information
- Prefer quick probes over thorough studies early on
- Increase rigor as confidence grows
- **When**: resource-constrained learning

### Rule 4: Alternate Theory and Practice
- Alternate between: learn concept → apply it → reflect on what happened
- Don't front-load all theory or all practice
- **When**: skill acquisition, learning by doing

### Rule 5: Breadth Then Depth
- Survey the whole landscape before diving deep into any area
- Prevents premature specialization in the wrong sub-topic
- **When**: entering a new field, starting research

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Map What You Know and Don't Know
- What's certain? What's uncertain? What's unknown?

### Step 2: Prioritize by Information Value
- Which unknown, if resolved, changes the most about your plan?
- Address that first.

### Step 3: Learn in Cycles
- Each cycle: hypothesis → test → update → new hypothesis
- Get faster at cycles rather than trying to get it right the first time

## When to Use
- Entering new domains, research, exploration
- When requirements are unclear
- Skill acquisition, R&D

## Verification
- [ ] Knowledge gaps identified
- [ ] Most uncertain items addressed first
- [ ] Assumptions tested before relied upon
- [ ] Learning captured and applied to next steps
