# Priority Framework Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Systematic methods for ranking items when you have too many things competing for attention. Different frameworks emphasize different factors. Choose based on what matters most in your context.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency x Importance)
- **Urgent + Important**: Do first
- **Important + Not Urgent**: Schedule (this is where strategy lives)
- **Urgent + Not Important**: Delegate or minimize
- **Neither**: Eliminate
- **When**: personal productivity, task triage

### Rule 2: MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- **Must have**: Non-negotiable, system fails without it
- **Should have**: Important, painful to miss
- **Could have**: Nice to have, include if resources allow
- **Won't have (this time)**: Explicitly excluded
- **When**: feature prioritization, requirements

### Rule 3: RICE Score (Reach x Impact x Confidence / Effort)
- Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence%) / Effort
- Process in descending RICE order
- **When**: product/feature prioritization with data

### Rule 4: Cost of Delay
- Prioritize by how much value is lost per unit time of delay
- High cost-of-delay items go first regardless of size
- **When**: time-sensitive work, opportunity costs matter

### Rule 5: Dependencies First
- Items that block other items go first
- Unblock the most downstream work earliest
- **When**: project planning, critical path analysis

## Application

### Step 1: Choose Framework
- Time management → Eisenhower
- Requirements/features → MoSCoW or RICE
- Project scheduling → Dependencies First + Cost of Delay

### Step 2: Score All Items
- Apply the chosen framework to every item
- Make scoring explicit and documented

### Step 3: Execute in Priority Order
- Work top-down through the ranked list
- Reassess if conditions change

## When to Use
- Backlog grooming, sprint planning, personal task management
- Any situation with more items than capacity

## Verification
- [ ] Framework matched to context
- [ ] All items scored consistently
- [ ] Top priorities are genuinely highest-value
- [ ] "Not doing" items explicitly identified
