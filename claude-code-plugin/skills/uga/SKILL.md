# Universal Goal Analysis Framework

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The comprehensive question framework that applies to EVERY goal, regardless of domain.

Domain-specific procedures tell you "what to do for X" - this procedure tells you "how to think about any goal." This is where the real leverage is.

Before pursuing any goal, systematically work through these questions. Not every question applies to every goal, but the categories always do.

---

## When to Use

- Any new goal (before starting)
- Any goal that feels stuck
- Any goal where you're uncertain about approach
- Periodic review of ongoing goals
- When domain-specific procedure doesn't exist

---

## The Seven Universal Questions

### Question 1: Is This the Right Goal?

**Purpose**: Catch goal substitution early.

| Check | Question | Red Flag |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Origin | Where did this goal come from? | External pressure, not internal |
| Proxy | Is this a proxy for something else? | "Make money" when you want security |
| Assumption | What am I assuming about cause-effect? | "Degree → Job" assumes market wants degrees |
| Alternative | What would achieving this NOT give me? | If significant gaps, wrong goal |

**Key Question**: "If I achieve this, will I actually have what I want?"

→ If NO or UNCERTAIN: INVOKE /grfr

---

### Question 2: What Does Success Actually Look Like?

**Purpose**: Make success concrete and verifiable.

| Dimension | Question | Output |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| State | What is different when achieved? | Observable changes |
| Feeling | How will I feel? | Emotional markers |
| Evidence | What would prove success to a skeptic? | Objective criteria |
| Counterfactual | What won't change? | Bounded expectations |

**Success Definition Template**:
```
SUCCESS FOR: [goal]
==================
I will know I've succeeded when:
- Observable: [what's different in world]
- Feeling: [internal state change]
- Evidence: [what proves it]
- NOT included: [what won't change]
```

→ If success unclear: INVOKE /crw

---

### Question 3: What's Actually Required?

**Purpose**: Identify necessary vs assumed requirements.

| Category | Question | Output |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Truly necessary | What MUST happen for success? | Non-negotiable requirements |
| Assumed necessary | What am I assuming is required? | Potentially optional |
| Actually optional | What could I skip and still succeed? | Flexibility points |
| Unknown | What requirements am I unaware of? | Research needed |

**Requirement Analysis**:
```
REQUIREMENTS FOR: [goal]
========================
MUST (truly necessary):
- [requirement] - Why: [reasoning]

ASSUMED (may not be necessary):
- [requirement] - Test: [how to verify]

OPTIONAL (nice but not required):
- [requirement]

UNKNOWN (need to discover):
- [area of uncertainty]
```

→ If requirements unclear: INVOKE /assumption_verification

---

### Question 4: What Are the Real Constraints?

**Purpose**: Distinguish hard constraints from assumed constraints.

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Hard | Cannot be changed, physics/law | Time flows one direction |
| Soft | Difficult but possible to change | Budget, skills |
| Assumed | Believed but not verified | "I can't ask for help" |
| Self-imposed | Chosen but not required | "I must do this alone" |

**Constraint Analysis**:
```
CONSTRAINTS FOR: [goal]
=======================
HARD (truly immovable):
- [constraint] - Why immovable: [reasoning]

SOFT (difficult but changeable):
- [constraint] - How to change: [approach]

ASSUMED (needs verification):
- [constraint] - Test: [how to verify]

SELF-IMPOSED (choice, not requirement):
- [constraint] - If removed: [what changes]
```

→ If constraints feel insurmountable: INVOKE /constraint_workarounds

---

### Question 5: What Could Go Wrong?

**Purpose**: Anticipate failures before they happen.

| Failure Mode | Question | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Execution | What if I can't do the steps? | Build capability or delegate |
| External | What if environment doesn't cooperate? | Contingency plans |
| Self | What if I sabotage myself? | Accountability structures |
| Success | What if success has downsides? | Plan for success problems |

**Pre-Mortem Analysis**:
```
FAILURE MODES FOR: [goal]
=========================
Most likely failure: [mode]
  Why: [reasoning]
  Mitigation: [plan]

Worst case failure: [mode]
  Impact: [what happens]
  Prevention: [how to avoid]

Success failure (downsides of winning): [mode]
  What goes wrong: [description]
  Preparation: [how to handle]
```

→ If failure modes severe: INVOKE /ria

---

### Question 6: What's the Minimum Viable Path?

**Purpose**: Find the simplest path to the goal.

| Simplification | Question | Output |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Scope | What's the smallest version that counts? | Minimum viable goal |
| Steps | What's the fewest steps possible? | Critical path |
| Resources | What's the least I could use? | Minimum investment |
| Time | What's the fastest this could happen? | Best case timeline |

**Minimum Path Analysis**:
```
MINIMUM VIABLE PATH TO: [goal]
==============================
Smallest version that still succeeds:
[description]

Critical steps only:
1. [step] - required because [why]
2. [step] - required because [why]

Minimum resources:
- [resource] - amount: [minimum]

Fastest timeline:
[best case] - assuming [conditions]
```

→ If minimum path unclear: INVOKE /dcm

---

### Question 7: What Am I Not Seeing?

**Purpose**: Expose blind spots.

| Blind Spot Type | How to Find | Question |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| Perspective | Other stakeholders | Who else is affected? What do they see? |
| Domain | Adjacent fields | What would an expert in [X] notice? |
| Temporal | Future/past | What would future me regret? What did past me miss? |
| Scale | Zoom in/out | What at 10x bigger? 10x smaller? |

**Blind Spot Check**:
```
BLIND SPOT CHECK FOR: [goal]
============================
Other perspectives:
- [stakeholder] would see: [their view]

Adjacent domains:
- [domain] expert would notice: [insight]

Temporal:
- Future me might regret: [concern]
- Past attempts missed: [lesson]

Scale:
- 10x bigger version: [implication]
- 10x smaller version: [implication]
```

→ If blind spots likely: INVOKE /spd

## Quick Universal Analysis

For simple goals, answer just these three:

1. **Is this the right goal?** (Or proxy/substitution?)
2. **What does success look like?** (Concrete, verifiable)
3. **What's the minimum path?** (Simplest approach)
