# MAKING CHOICES: A Decision Procedure

**What this is**: A mechanical, step-by-step procedure that takes you from "I have a decision to make" to "here is my answer." No expertise in decision science required. Follow the steps. Write things down — the writing IS the mechanism.

**Keep all your writing in one place** — a single document, notebook, or sheet of paper. You will refer back to earlier steps.

**Validation status**: This procedure has not been validated by domain experts.

---

## STEP 0: CLASSIFY YOUR DECISION

Answer four questions. Write your answers.

**0A. REVERSIBILITY**: If you choose wrong, can you realistically undo it within a month at a cost you'd actually pay?
- **(Y)** Yes — I can undo it easily or at modest cost
- **(N)** No — undoing it would be very costly, painful, or impossible

**0B. TIME**: How long before you must decide or lose the option?
- **(W)** Weeks or more / no deadline
- **(D)** Days
- **(H)** Hours or less

**0C. STAKES**: If you get this wrong, how bad is it?
- **(L)** Low — annoying but no lasting harm
- **(M)** Medium — real loss of money, time, or opportunity
- **(H)** High — major life impact, years to recover

**0D. STUCK**: Right now, do you feel confused about what you want, overwhelmed by options, or unable to move forward?
- **(Y)** Yes
- **(N)** No

### Routing Table

**Check each rule IN ORDER. Use the FIRST rule that matches. Stop checking.**

| Rule | If your answers are... | Go to |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| 1 | 0D = Y (regardless of other answers) | **Section E** (Stuck) |
| 2 | 0B = H AND 0C = M or H | **Section D** (Emergency) |
| 3 | 0A = Y AND 0C = L | **Section A** (Fast-Track) |
| 4 | 0A = N AND 0C = H | **Section C** (High-Stakes) |
| 5 | Everything else | **Section B** (Standard) |

**If you answered "?" to any question**: Use the more cautious default: for reversibility, assume (N). For time, assume (D). For stakes, assume (H). These route you to a more thorough process, which is safer.

---

## SECTION A: FAST-TRACK DECISIONS

*For reversible, low-stakes decisions. Target: done in 5 minutes.*

**Time box: 15 minutes maximum. If you exceed this, pick one and move on.**

**A0** (Assumption check): Write the decision in one sentence. Is there a bigger decision hiding behind this one? If yes, write THAT decision and restart Step 0 for it. If no, continue.

**A1**: Write down all options you can see. Don't evaluate — just list.

**A2**: Circle the one you're drawn to. Don't overthink. First instinct is fine here.

**A3** (Ruin check): For the option you circled, what's the worst that happens? Write it in one sentence. Is that worst case something you can live with? If yes -> A4. If no -> go to **Section B** (this isn't actually a fast-track decision).

**A4**: Your decision is the one you circled. Write it down as a statement: "I will ___."

**A5**: Set a calendar reminder for 1 month from now: "Review: Was [decision] the right call?" -> **Done.**

---

## SECTION B: STANDARD DECISIONS

*For most decisions. Time box: 1-3 hours of active work, spread over 1-3 days.*

### Framing

**B0a**: Write the decision in one sentence.

**B0b**: Is this one decision or a chain? Ask: "What would I need to have already decided for this to make sense?" If the answer is anything other than "nothing," go decide THAT thing first (restart Step 0 for it).

**B0c** (Assumption check #1 — Is this the right frame?): Describe your decision in one sentence to someone NOT involved. Ask them: "What do you think this decision is really about?" Write their answer word-for-word. If their version is significantly different from yours, use their version for the rest of this section. *(If you can't ask someone right now, write the decision on paper and read it as if a stranger wrote it. Write the first alternative interpretation that comes to mind.)*

### Options

**B1**: List all your options. Include "do nothing / keep the status quo" as an explicit option.

**B1b** (Assumption check #2 — Have you identified all options?): Show your list to someone and ask: "What option am I not seeing?" Add anything they suggest. Also ask yourself: "Can I combine parts of different options? Can I create a new option that doesn't exist yet?"

### Outcomes

**B2**: Write down 3-5 outcomes you want from this decision. Make them checkable — you should be able to tell in 6 months whether each outcome happened or not.
- *(Example: Not "I want to be happy" but "I want to enjoy my daily work at least 4 days out of 5")*
- If you CANNOT write checkable outcomes -> go to **Section E**, then return here. *(If Section E sends you back and you still can't, go to E4 directly.)*

### Expert Check

**B3a**: Is there someone whose JOB involves making this type of decision? (Financial advisor for money, doctor for health, real estate agent for homes, etc.) Write their role.
- If yes -> go to **Section F** to consult them, then return to B4.
- If no -> continue.

### Outcome Mapping

**B4**: Make a table. Rows = your options (from B1). Columns = your outcomes (from B2). Add two extra columns: "Best realistic outcome" and "Worst realistic outcome."
- "Realistic" = has happened before to real people in similar situations. Not your fantasy, not your nightmare.

**B5** (Ruin check): Look at the "Worst realistic outcome" column. For each option: could you survive that worst case? Cross out any option where the answer is no.
- If ALL options are crossed out: Return to B1 and generate new options. Specifically try: (1) combinations of existing options, (2) partial versions of existing options, (3) ask someone what options you're missing. If you still can't find acceptable options after a second pass, go to **Section E**.

**B6** (Assumption check #3 — Will more information help?): Look at your table. Is there a specific piece of information that, if you had it, would change which option you pick? Write it down.
- If yes -> go get that specific information. Set a deadline for getting it. Then return here.
- If no -> stop researching. You have enough to decide.

### Scoring

**B7**: For each remaining option, score it against each outcome: **(+)** supports this outcome, **(0)** neutral, **(-)** works against this outcome. Fill in your table.

**B8**: Which outcome matters MOST to you? Circle it. The option with (+) on that outcome is your leading choice.
- **If two options tie** (same score on your top outcome): Re-score ONLY those two using a finer scale: (++, +, 0, -, --). If still tied, the options are genuinely equivalent — pick either one.

**B8.5** (Implementation check): For your top option, write the first three things you'd need to do THIS WEEK to execute it. Are you actually going to do them? If honestly "probably not," consider whether a lower-scoring but simpler option would produce better results in practice.

### Pre-Mortem

**B9**: Imagine it's 6 months from now and your chosen option failed badly. Write down: What went wrong? Be specific. Write at least 3 failure scenarios.
- For each failure: Is this preventable? If yes, write what you'd do to prevent it. If not preventable, can you live with it? If no -> reconsider your choice.

### Rationality Check

**B10** (Assumption check #4 — Am I being rational?):
- **B10a**: Name the emotion you feel most strongly about this decision. Write it.
- **B10b**: What would a skeptic say your REAL reason is for leaning toward this option? Write it, even if it's unflattering.
- **B10c**: If you're being honest — does the skeptic have a point? If yes, revisit your scoring.
- **B10d** (Assumption check #5 — Is now the right time to decide?): Are you currently in an emotional extreme (very angry, very excited, very tired, grieving, panicking)? If yes -> write down your current leaning and revisit in 48 hours.

### Decision

**B11**: Write your decision as a statement: "I will ___ because ___."

**B12**: Set a review date (1-6 months out). Write what you'll check to know if the decision was right. -> **Done.**

---

## SECTION C: HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS

*For irreversible + high-stakes decisions. Time box: 3-7 days of active work.*

### Framing

**C0a**: Write the decision in one sentence.

**C0b**: Same as B0b — is this one decision or a chain? If a chain, decide the prior decision first.

**C0c** (Default check): What happens if you change nothing? Write it down.
- Is that default acceptable? Ask: "Is there something specific making me want to change?" Write it down.
  - If you CAN'T name a specific reason -> Your decision is: Keep the default. Write it. **Done.**
  - If you CAN name a specific reason -> Continue.

**C0d** (Assumption check #1): Same as B0c — describe to an uninvolved person, get their version.

### Options

**C1**: Same as B1 + B1b, but spend more time. Generate at least 5 options, including "do nothing." Ask at least 2 people for options you're missing.

### Outcomes & Values

**C2a**: Same as B2 — write 3-5 checkable outcomes.

**C2b** (Assumption check #5 — Do you know what you want?): "What outcome would I be ashamed to want?" Write it, even if uncomfortable. If it's different from your stated outcomes, add it to the list as an honest criterion.

### Stakeholders

**C3**: List every person significantly affected by this decision. For each: How are they affected? Should they have input? Note anyone with relevant expertise — you'll consult them at C6.

### Outcome Mapping

**C4**: Same as B4 — make the table with best/worst realistic outcomes.

**C5**: Same as B5 — ruin check, eliminate unsurvivable options. (If all eliminated, return to C1 for new options.)

### Outside Input (NOT OPTIONAL)

**C6**: Find someone who will NOT just agree with you. Tell them your decision and your leaning. Ask them to argue AGAINST your preference. Write down their argument word-for-word.

**C6b**: Find a second person. Same exercise.

**C6c**: Did either person raise something you hadn't considered? If yes, update your table from C4.

### Emotional Awareness

**C7** (Assumption check #4): Name the emotion you feel most strongly. Write it. Ask yourself: "Would I make the same choice if I felt completely calm?" If no -> write your current leaning and come back in 48 hours.

### Weighted Scoring

**C8a**: Rank your outcomes in order of importance. Assign weights: most important = 3, second = 2, all others = 1.

**C8b**: Score each option against each outcome: (++, +, 0, -, --). Multiply by weights. Sum.

**C8c**: For your #1 most important outcome, any option scoring (-) or (--) is eliminated UNLESS it scores (++) on your #2 outcome. If no options remain after elimination, return to C1 — your constraints may be too tight.

### Pre-Mortem (Extended)

**C9**: Same as B9, but write 5+ failure scenarios. For each, also write: "What is the earliest warning sign that this is happening?"

### Gut Check

**C10**: Your scoring says option [X]. Your gut says ___. Are they the same?
- If yes -> C11.
- If different -> Write why your gut disagrees. Is it based on something your scoring missed (add it to the table and re-score) or on fear/comfort (acknowledge it and trust the scoring)?

### Decision

**C11**: Write: "I will ___ because ___. I considered [list alternatives]. The main risk is ___. I'll watch for [earliest warning sign]. Review date: [date]." -> **Done.**

---

## SECTION D: EMERGENCY DECISIONS

*For genuinely time-critical, non-trivial decisions. You have hours or less.*

**D1**: Set a timer for 60 seconds. Breathe. This step exists because panic degrades decision-making.

**D2**: Does a protocol already exist for this situation? (Company policy, medical guidelines, emergency procedures, legal requirements.)
- If yes -> Follow the protocol. Skip to D7.
- If no -> D3.

**D3**: Is there an expert you can reach RIGHT NOW? (Phone call, text, person in the room.)
- If yes -> D4.
- If no -> D5.

**D4**: Tell the expert: "I need you to decide [one sentence]. You have [time available]." Follow their recommendation. Skip to D7.

**D5**: Write down 2-3 options. No more — you don't have time.

**D6**: For each option, answer ONE question: "Which option minimizes irreversible harm?" Pick that one.

**D7**: Act immediately on your decision. Don't second-guess in the moment.

**D8**: Within 48 hours, review. Write: "What happened. What I chose. What I'd do differently." This is how you build better emergency intuition for next time. -> **Done.**

---

## SECTION E: STUCK DECISIONS

*For when you're confused, overwhelmed, or can't move forward.*

**E1** (Diagnosis): Which of these is most true?
- **(a)** I have too many options and can't compare them -> E2
- **(b)** I don't know what I actually want -> E3
- **(c)** I know what I want but I'm afraid -> You're not stuck, you're scared. Go to **Section B** with your preferred option already identified.
- **(d)** I've been going in circles and can't decide -> E5

**E2** (Too many options): Write all options on separate cards/lines. Sort into three piles: "Definitely yes" (would not be upset choosing this), "Maybe," and "Definitely no." Discard "Definitely no." If "Definitely yes" has 1-3 options, take those to **Section B, Step B4**. If "Definitely yes" is empty, your problem is actually (b) — go to E3.

**E3** (Values unclear): Complete these sentences. Write quickly, first thing that comes to mind:
- "Five years from now, I want my daily life to look like ___."
- "The thing I'm most afraid of is ___."
- "If I could only have one thing from this decision, it would be ___."

**E3b**: Do your answers from E3 point toward one option? If yes -> do E7, then take that option to **Section B, Step B4**. If no -> E4.

**E4**: This procedure has reached its limit. You need an outside perspective. Talk to:
- A therapist or counselor (for life decisions involving identity or relationships)
- A mentor (for career or professional decisions)
- A trusted friend who knows your situation well

Tell them: "I'm stuck between [options] and I can't figure out what I actually want." Their job is not to choose for you but to help you see what you can't see alone.

**E5** (Going in circles): You've been thinking about this too long. Force a decision with the coin flip test.

**E6** (Coin flip test): Assign heads to one option and tails to another. Flip a coin (or use a random number generator). DO NOT use the result as your decision. Instead:
- **E6a**: Notice your IMMEDIATE emotional reaction to the result. Relieved? Disappointed? Nothing?
- **E6b**: Relieved -> the coin picked what you wanted. That's your answer. Do E7, then go to **Section B, Step B9** (pre-mortem) for that option.
- **E6c**: Disappointed -> the coin picked what you DON'T want. Flip it. That's your answer. Do E7, then go to **Section B, Step B9**.
- **E6d**: Neutral -> the options are genuinely equivalent. Pick either one. Do E7. **Done.**

**E7** (Assumption check #6 — Not deciding IS deciding): Before leaving this section, write: "If I don't decide, what happens by default? Is that acceptable?" If the default is worse than any option you've identified, you now have a deadline: the default is getting worse while you deliberate.

---

## SECTION F: WHEN TO DELEGATE

*For when you lack the expertise and the stakes are real.*

**Write down which step sent you here** (e.g., B3, C3). You'll return there when done.

**F1**: What type of expert do you need? Write their role (financial advisor, doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.).

**F2**: Find 2-3 candidates. Check: Do they have conflicts of interest? (Will they profit from a specific recommendation?) If yes, note it — their advice may be biased. Get at least one opinion from someone without a financial stake.

**F3**: Before consulting, write: "The specific question I need answered is ___." Not "what should I do?" but a factual or technical question they can answer with expertise. Examples:
- "What are the success rates for these two treatments?"
- "What is the financial risk of this investment structure?"
- "What legal exposure do I have in each scenario?"

**F4**: Consult. Take notes. Write their answer verbatim.

**F5**: Remember — experts inform your decision, they don't make it. They answered a technical question. You still decide based on your values and situation.

**F6**: Return to the step that sent you here. Continue from the next step after that one. -> **Done.**

## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Card 1: Decision Type Routing (Priority Order)

| Check | Signal | Route |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Stuck/confused? | Can't identify options or values | Section E |
| Time-critical? | Hours or less + medium/high stakes | Section D |
| Low stakes + reversible? | Can undo easily, no lasting harm | Section A |
| High stakes + irreversible? | Can't undo, major life impact | Section C |
| Everything else | | Section B |

### Card 2: The Five Assumption Checks

1. **Is this the right frame?** (B0c/C0d) — Describe to an outsider, use their version
2. **Have I found all options?** (B1b/C1) — Ask someone what you're missing
3. **Will more info help?** (B6) — Name the specific info that would change your choice
4. **Am I being rational?** (B10/C7) — Name your emotion, imagine the skeptic's take
5. **Do I know what I want?** (B2/C2b) — Write checkable outcomes, include the shameful one

### Card 3: Warning Signs

| Warning | What it means | What to do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| You feel rushed but there's no actual deadline | Manufactured urgency | Ask "what option do I lose if I wait 48 hours?" |
| You "can technically undo it" but never would | Not actually reversible | Route as irreversible (Section B or C) |
| You've been "deciding" for weeks | Procedure as procrastination | Set a hard deadline and honor it |
| Your preferred option wins on every criterion | You're gaming the scoring | Score your least-preferred option first |
| You can't write a worst-case scenario | You haven't thought about this enough | Do the pre-mortem before deciding |
| Everyone you've consulted agrees with you | You've only asked allies | Find someone who'll push back |

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Treating a two-way door as one-way.** If you can undo it, decide fast and iterate. Don't spend weeks on a reversible choice.

2. **Researching as a substitute for deciding.** If you can't name the specific information that would change your answer, stop researching.

3. **Consulting the wrong people.** Ask people with relevant knowledge or knowledge of your situation. Not everyone you know.

4. **Doing the procedure in your head.** If you didn't write it down, you didn't do it. The writing forces specificity and prevents you from silently shifting criteria.

5. **Optimizing before eliminating.** Always check for unacceptable worst cases FIRST, then optimize among what's left.

6. **Ignoring implementation difficulty.** The best-scoring option is only the best if you'll actually execute it.

7. **Not deciding is deciding.** While you deliberate, you're choosing the status quo. Make sure that's an option you'd pick deliberately.

---

## WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE

1. **Moral or identity decisions.** If the decision is about what kind of person you want to be (not what outcome you want), ask "What would the person I want to be do?" instead of scoring options.

2. **You have deep expertise AND low emotional involvement.** If you've made this type of decision successfully many times and feel calm about it, trust your trained intuition.

3. **All options are genuinely equivalent.** If the procedure can't distinguish between options, they're close enough that any choice is fine. Pick one.

4. **Legal, safety, or ethical obligations.** If one option is legally or ethically required, the procedure is irrelevant. Do the required thing.

5. **The decision is actually a preference.** If you won't care about this in 5 years, skip the procedure. Pick what you like.

## WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Trivial Decision — "Which gym should I join?"

**Step 0**: Reversibility: Y (can cancel). Time: W (no deadline). Stakes: L (minor cost). Stuck: N.
**Route**: Rule 3 matches -> **Section A**.
**A0**: "Which gym should I join?" Bigger decision? No.
**A1**: Planet Fitness, local CrossFit, YMCA.
**A2**: Circle: CrossFit (I'm drawn to the community).
**A3**: Worst case: I waste $150/month for a few months. Can I live with that? Yes.
**A4**: "I will join CrossFit."
**A5**: Review in 1 month.
**Total time**: 3 minutes.

### Example 2: Standard Decision — "Should I accept this job offer?"

**Step 0**: Reversibility: N (can quit but with consequences). Time: D (offer expires in 5 days). Stakes: M (meaningful career impact). Stuck: N.
**Route**: Rule 5 -> **Section B**.
**B0a**: "Should I accept this software engineering role at Company X?"
**B0b**: Prior decision needed? No — I've already decided I want to change jobs.
**B0c**: Friend says: "Sounds like you're really asking whether you're ready to leave your current team."
*(That reframe changes the decision from "is Company X good?" to "am I ready to leave?").*
**B1**: Options: Accept offer, Decline and stay, Decline and keep looking.
**B2**: Outcomes: (1) Higher salary (+20%), (2) Work I find interesting, (3) Reasonable hours, (4) Career growth in 3 years.
**B3a**: Relevant expert? No — this is a personal fit question.
**B4-B7**: [Scoring table completed]
**B8**: Most important outcome: Career growth. Accept scores (+). Keep looking scores (0). Stay scores (-).
**B8.5**: First three actions this week: (1) Sign offer, (2) Give notice, (3) Plan transition. Will I do them? Yes.
**B9**: Pre-mortem: "I took the job and it failed because... the team culture was toxic." Preventable? Can I talk to more team members before signing? Yes — I'll do that today.
**B10**: Emotion: Excitement mixed with guilt about leaving. Skeptic says: "You want to leave because you're bored, not because this offer is great." Fair point — but the scoring still favors accepting even accounting for that.
**B11**: "I will accept the offer because it scores highest on career growth, my top priority, and the worst case (bad culture) is survivable (I can leave again)."

### Example 3: Stuck Decision — "What should I do with my career?"

**Step 0**: Stuck: Y -> **Section E**.
**E1**: Diagnosis: (b) I don't know what I actually want.
**E3**: "Five years from now, I want my daily life to look like... working on problems I find genuinely interesting, having time for outdoor activities, not dreading Monday." "The thing I'm most afraid of is... being 40 and realizing I wasted my best years on something I didn't care about." "If I could only have one thing from this decision, it would be... work I find meaningful."
**E3b**: These answers point toward: prioritizing meaning over salary. This doesn't pick a specific option, but it gives me a criterion.
**E7**: "If I don't decide, what happens by default? I stay in my current role, which is fine but not meaningful. That's acceptable short-term but degrading long-term."
-> Go to **Section B, Step B2**, using "work I find meaningful" as my primary outcome. Now I can evaluate specific options against that criterion.

## UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK

This procedure was built by analyzing 14 dimensions of decision-making, mapping the full option space, extracting 23 hidden assumptions that trip people up, and validating every step for mechanical executability. The key insight it embeds: **most bad decisions aren't caused by choosing the wrong option — they're caused by solving the wrong problem, missing better options, or not knowing what you actually want.** The procedure front-loads the framing and values work before any option evaluation begins.

### The 14 Dimensions

1. Reversibility — Can you undo it?
2. Stakes — How big is the outcome gap?
3. Time Pressure — When must you decide?
4. Information Availability — What can you know vs. what is unknowable?
5. Number and Nature of Options — What are you choosing among?
6. Uncertainty Structure — What kind of uncertainty do you face?
7. Emotional Involvement — How activated are you?
8. Expertise and Knowledge — How much do you/advisors know?
9. Who Is Affected — Who bears consequences?
10. Decision Frequency — One-time or repeated?
11. Value Clarity — Do you know what you want?
12. Interaction Effects — Is this entangled with other decisions?
13. Default and Status Quo — What happens if you do nothing?
14. Accountability — Must you justify the decision?

### The 8 Canonical Patterns

| Pattern | Key Dimensions | Strategy |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Two-Way Door | Reversible + low stakes | Decide fast, iterate |
| Bet the Farm | Irreversible + high stakes + one-time | Maximum deliberation |
| Emergency | Time-critical + significant stakes + low expertise | Pre-committed defaults or expert delegation |
| Paralysis Trap | Unclear values + many options + no deadline | Artificially constrain, clarify values first |
| Delegate | Low expertise + high stakes + others affected | Find qualified advisor |
| Pathological | Irreversible + existential + ignorant of ignorance | Stop. Get help. Don't decide alone. |
| Expertise Routine | Expert + frequent + moderate stakes | Trust developed heuristics |
| Values First | Unclear/self-deceptive values + any | Route to value elicitation |

### Known Limitations

- Emotional self-assessment is inherently non-mechanical
- "Realistic" worst/best case is somewhat subjective
- Outside input steps require access to other people
- Multi-party decisions (couples, teams) are under-addressed — the procedure is designed for a single decision-maker
- The procedure assumes literacy and writing ability
