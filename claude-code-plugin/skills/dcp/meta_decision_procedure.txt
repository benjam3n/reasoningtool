MAKING CHOICES: A MECHANICAL DECISION PROCEDURE
=================================================

This procedure routes you from "I have a decision to make" to "here is what
I will do" without requiring any expertise in decision science.

Follow each step exactly. Do what it says, not what you think it means.
When a step says "write down," write it down -- on paper, in a document,
wherever. Do not skip the writing. The writing IS the thinking.

Parenthetical notes (like this) explain WHY a step exists. You can ignore
them. The procedure works without them.


================================================================================
STEP 0: QUICK CLASSIFICATION
================================================================================

Answer these four questions. Circle or write down the letter for each.

QUESTION 0A: Can you undo this decision easily?
  (Y) Yes -- you can reverse it with little cost or effort.
      Examples: trying a new restaurant, signing up for a free trial,
      rearranging furniture, choosing which book to read next.
  (N) No -- reversing it would be difficult, expensive, or impossible.
      Examples: quitting a job, having surgery, signing a lease,
      publishing something publicly.
  (?) You are not sure.

QUESTION 0B: How much time do you have?
  (H) Hours or less -- you must decide very soon.
  (D) Days to weeks -- you have some time but a real deadline.
  (W) Weeks or more -- no pressing deadline.
  (?) You are not sure.

QUESTION 0C: If you get this wrong, how bad is it?
  (L) Low -- minor inconvenience, costs under a day's pay, easily fixed.
  (M) Medium -- real consequences but survivable. Costs weeks of pay,
      causes meaningful disruption, affects others.
  (H) High -- major life impact. Costs months/years of pay, affects health,
      affects many people, or cannot be undone.
  (?) You are not sure.

QUESTION 0D: Do you feel stuck, confused about what you want, or
             overwhelmed right now?
  (Y) Yes -- you have been going in circles, or you do not know what
      outcome you actually want, or the decision feels paralyzing.
  (N) No -- you are clear on what you want and can think about this calmly.

---------------------------------------
ROUTING TABLE: Find your combination.
---------------------------------------

If 0D = Y (stuck/confused/overwhelmed):
  --> Go to SECTION E: Stuck Decisions (page down to Section E).

If 0B = H (hours or less) AND 0C = M or H:
  --> Go to SECTION D: Emergency Decisions.

If 0A = Y AND 0C = L:
  --> Go to SECTION A: Fast-Track Decisions.

If 0C = H AND 0A = N:
  --> Go to SECTION C: High-Stakes Decisions.

If 0A = ? OR 0B = ? OR 0C = ?:
  --> Go to STEP 0.5: Clarification (immediately below).

Everything else:
  --> Go to SECTION B: Standard Decisions.

---------------------------------------
STEP 0.5: CLARIFICATION (only if you answered "?" to any question above)
---------------------------------------

For each "?" answer, do the following:

0.5a: Write down: "I am not sure about [reversibility / time / stakes]
because ___________."

0.5b: For reversibility (?): Ask -- "If I decided this and then changed
my mind tomorrow, what would I have to do to undo it?" Write down the
specific actions. If those actions take less than a day and cost less than
a day's pay, answer (Y). Otherwise answer (N).

0.5c: For time (?): Ask -- "What is the latest I could decide without
losing any options?" Write down that date. If it is more than 2 weeks
away, answer (W). If 1-14 days, answer (D). If today, answer (H).

0.5d: For stakes (?): Ask -- "If I pick the worst option, what specifically
happens?" Write the worst realistic outcome. Rate it (L), (M), or (H)
using the definitions above.

Now return to the routing table with your new answers.


================================================================================
SECTION A: FAST-TRACK DECISIONS
================================================================================
(For: reversible + low stakes. Pattern: Two-Way Door.)
(Goal: Decide in under 5 minutes. Overthinking these wastes more than
choosing wrong.)

---ASSUMPTION CHECK A0---
(Protects against Assumption #1: "The decision is correctly framed.")

Write down the decision in one sentence: "I am deciding between ___ and ___."
Read it back. Ask: "Is this actually what I am deciding, or is there a
bigger decision hiding behind this one?"

  If there is a bigger decision --> Write it down. Re-do Step 0 for THAT
  decision instead.

  If this is the real decision --> Continue to A1.

---

STEP A1: List your options.

Write them down. You need at least two. If you only have one, you are not
making a decision -- you are deciding whether to act or not. Reframe it as:
"Do [thing]" vs. "Do not do [thing]."

What you should see: 2-5 concrete options written down.

---

STEP A2: Pick the one your gut says.

Do not analyze. Which option are you leaning toward right now? Circle it.

What you should see: One option circled.

---

STEP A3: Quick ruin check.

Ask: "Is there any realistic scenario where this circled option causes
serious, hard-to-reverse harm?"

  (Y) Yes --> This is NOT a fast-track decision. Go to SECTION B.
  (N) No --> Continue to A4.

(Protects against Assumption #12: "I should optimize for the best outcome"
-- sometimes you need to avoid ruin, not find the best.)

---

STEP A4: Set a review date.

Write down: "I will check whether this was a good decision on [date
2 weeks from now]."

---

STEP A5: Decide.

Do the circled option. You are done.

If it turns out badly, it is reversible -- you will fix it at the review
date or sooner.

What you should see: A decision made in under 5 minutes with a review date
written down.


================================================================================
SECTION B: STANDARD DECISIONS
================================================================================
(For: most decisions that are not emergencies, not trivially reversible,
and not highest-stakes.)

---ASSUMPTION CHECK B0---
(Protects against Assumption #1: "The decision is correctly framed" and
Assumption #2: "I have identified all the options.")

B0a: Write down the decision in one sentence.

B0b: Write down who told you this was the decision. Was it you? A boss?
A situation? Write the source.

B0c: Ask: "What would a very different person (different background,
different values, different expertise) say this decision is actually about?"
Write their version.

  If their version is substantially different --> Write both versions down.
  Use THEIR version for the rest of this section. (People who reframe your
  decisions are often seeing something you missed.)

  If their version is basically the same --> Continue with your original
  framing.

---

STEP B1: List ALL options you can think of.

Write them down. Include options you have already dismissed. Include
"do nothing / keep things as they are." Include "delay the decision."

What you should see: 3-8 options listed. If you have fewer than 3, do B1b.

B1b (only if fewer than 3 options): Ask someone who is not involved in
this decision: "I am deciding about [topic]. What options am I missing?"
Write down whatever they say, even if it seems wrong.

(Protects against Assumption #2: "I have identified all the options.")

---

STEP B2: Write down what you want the outcome to be.

Not which option you want to pick -- what you want to be TRUE after you
decide. Write 2-5 outcomes that matter to you, stated as things you could
check later.

Good: "I want to spend less than $500/month on this."
Bad: "I want the best value." (You cannot check "best.")

What you should see: 2-5 checkable outcome statements.

(Protects against Assumption #5: "I know what I want." If you cannot write
checkable outcomes, go to SECTION E.)

---

STEP B3: Check if you should delegate this decision.

Answer these two questions:

B3a: "Is there someone who has made this exact type of decision
     successfully at least 5 times before?"
B3b: "Is the outcome important enough that getting it wrong matters?"

  If BOTH are yes --> Go to SECTION F: When to Delegate.
  If either is no --> Continue to B4.

---

STEP B4: For each option, write the BEST and WORST realistic outcome.

Make a table:

| Option | Best realistic outcome | Worst realistic outcome |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| ...    | ...                  | ...                    |

"Realistic" means: has happened before to real people, or could plausibly
happen. Not fantasy best or catastrophe worst.

What you should see: A filled table with 2 columns per option.

---

STEP B5: Eliminate any option where the worst outcome is unacceptable.

Look at each "worst realistic outcome." Ask: "Could I live with this?"

  Cross out any option where the answer is no.

(Protects against Assumption #12: optimizing for best while ignoring ruin.)

What you should see: Some options may be crossed out. At least one remains.
If ALL are crossed out, go to SECTION E (you may need to reframe).

---

STEP B6: Check if getting more information would actually change your choice.

---ASSUMPTION CHECK B6---
(Protects against Assumption #3: "More information will improve the
decision.")

Ask: "Is there a specific piece of information that, if I learned it,
would change which option I pick?"

  (Y) Yes, I can name the specific information --> Write it down.
      Can you get this information in less than 1/3 of your remaining
      decision time?
        (Y) Yes --> Get the information. Then return to B4 and redo
            with the new information.
        (N) No --> Continue to B7. (The information is not worth the delay.)

  (N) No, or I cannot name what would change my mind --> Continue to B7.
      (You already have enough information. More research is procrastination.)

---

STEP B7: Rank remaining options against your outcomes from B2.

For each option, score it against each outcome:
  (+) This option makes this outcome more likely.
  (0) This option does not affect this outcome.
  (-) This option makes this outcome less likely.

| Option   | Outcome 1 | Outcome 2 | Outcome 3 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Option A | +         | 0         | -         |
| Option B | 0         | +         | +         |

What you should see: A grid with +, 0, and - marks.

---

STEP B8: Read the grid. Which option has the most (+) marks and fewest
(-) marks?

  If one option is clearly best --> Continue to B9 with that option.

  If two or more options look similar --> Ask: "Which of my outcomes in B2
  matters MOST to me?" Use that outcome as the tiebreaker. The option that
  scores (+) on that outcome wins.

  If you STILL cannot pick --> Go to SECTION E (you may have a values
  confusion, not a decision problem).

---

STEP B9: Pre-mortem.

Write down: "I have decided on [option]. It is now 6 months later and this
decision turned out badly. What went wrong?"

Write 2-3 things that could go wrong.

For each one, ask: "Can I do something NOW to reduce this risk?"

  If yes --> Write down the action and do it.
  If no --> Accept the risk and continue.

---

---ASSUMPTION CHECK B10---
(Protects against Assumption #4: "I am being rational about this" and
Assumption #18: "The stated reasons are the real reasons.")

B10a: Write down WHY you are choosing this option. List 2-3 reasons.

B10b: Now ask: "If someone who disagrees with me read these reasons,
what would they say my REAL reason is?"

Write their version. Read both versions.

  If their version feels uncomfortably accurate --> Pause. You may be
  rationalizing. Consider whether the "real reason" is actually a good
  reason. If it is, proceed. If it is not, return to B7.

  If their version seems wrong or irrelevant --> Proceed to B11.

---

STEP B11: State your decision and act.

Write down: "I am choosing [option] because [top 2 reasons from B10a].
I will know this was a good decision if [checkable outcome from B2]
by [date]."

What you should see: One sentence with the decision, reasons, success
criteria, and a date.

---

STEP B12: Set a review date.

Write down a date to check the outcomes from B2. Put it on your calendar.

You are done.


================================================================================
SECTION C: HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS
================================================================================
(For: irreversible + high stakes. Pattern: Bet the Farm.)
(Goal: Maximum deliberation. Use all the time available.)

---ASSUMPTION CHECK C0---
(Protects against Assumption #1: "The decision is correctly framed" and
Assumption #17: "Choosing not to decide is not a decision.")

C0a: Write down the decision in one sentence.

C0b: Write down: "The last possible date I can decide is ___."
     Write down: "The cost of deciding one week later is ___."

  If the cost of one week's delay is low --> Use that week. Do not rush.

C0c: Write down: "What happens if I make NO decision and let the default
play out?"

  If the default outcome is acceptable --> You may not need to decide at
  all. Ask: "Am I making this decision because I should, or because I feel
  like I should?" If only the latter, seriously consider doing nothing.

  If the default is unacceptable --> Continue to C1.

---

STEP C1: List ALL options, including ones you have dismissed.

Same as B1, but add these extra prompts:

C1a: "What option would someone with twice my budget choose?"
C1b: "What option would someone with half my budget choose?"
C1c: "What option would someone with completely different values choose?"
C1d: "What option involves combining two of my current options?"

Write all of these down even if they seem impractical.

What you should see: 5-15 options listed.

---

STEP C2: Write down your desired outcomes (same as B2) but add:

C2a: "What outcome am I MOST afraid of?" (Write it down specifically.)
C2b: "What outcome would I be ashamed to want?" (Write it if there is one.)

(Protects against Assumption #5: "I know what I want" and Assumption #18:
"The stated reasons are the real reasons.")

What you should see: 3-7 outcome statements including uncomfortable ones.

---

STEP C3: Identify who else is affected.

Write a list of every person or group affected by this decision.
For each, write what THEY would want the outcome to be.

What you should see: A list of people/groups with their desired outcomes.

  If any of these people have relevant expertise --> Go to SECTION F
  for THAT person, then return here.

---

STEP C4: For each option, write the best, worst, AND most likely outcome.

| Option | Best realistic | Worst realistic | Most likely |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ...    | ...           | ...             | ...         |

What you should see: A table with 3 columns filled in per option.

---

STEP C5: Eliminate options with unacceptable worst outcomes.

Same as B5, but stricter: for high-stakes decisions, ask "Could I live
with this for 5+ years?" since these are hard to reverse.

What you should see: Remaining options all have survivable worst cases.

---

STEP C6: For remaining options, get outside input.

This is NOT optional for high-stakes decisions.

C6a: Describe the decision and your options to someone who is NOT
     emotionally involved and who will not just agree with you.

C6b: Ask them: "What am I not seeing?"

C6c: Write down what they say, even if you disagree.

C6d: Ask them: "If you had to argue AGAINST the option I seem to prefer,
     what would you say?"

Write down their argument.

What you should see: Written notes from at least one outside perspective.

---

---ASSUMPTION CHECK C7---
(Protects against Assumption #4: "I am being rational about this.")

C7a: Name the emotion you feel most strongly about this decision.
     Write it down. (Examples: fear, excitement, guilt, obligation, desire
     to prove something, desire to avoid conflict.)

C7b: Ask: "If I did NOT feel [that emotion], would I choose differently?"

  (Y) Yes --> The emotion may be driving the decision, not the facts.
      Before proceeding, sleep on it (literally -- decide tomorrow).
      If you still feel the same way after sleeping, continue to C8.
  (N) No --> Continue to C8.

---

STEP C8: Score options against outcomes (same as B7), but weight them.

C8a: Rank your outcomes from B2/C2 in order of importance (1 = most
important).

C8b: Score each option against each outcome using:
  (++) Strongly supports this outcome
  (+)  Somewhat supports
  (0)  Neutral
  (-)  Somewhat undermines
  (--) Strongly undermines

C8c: For your #1 most important outcome, any option scoring (-) or (--)
is eliminated unless it scores (++) on your #2 outcome.

What you should see: A weighted grid with a clear or near-clear winner.

---

STEP C9: Extended pre-mortem.

Write: "I chose [option]. It is 2 years later and I deeply regret it.
Write the story of what went wrong."

Write the full story -- at least a paragraph.

Then write: "I chose [option]. It is 2 years later and it was the best
decision I ever made. Write the story of what went right."

Write the full story.

Read both stories. Ask: "Is there anything in the regret story I can
prevent NOW?"

  If yes --> Write down the preventive action.
  If no --> Accept the risk.

---

STEP C10: Final gut check.

After all this analysis, what does your gut say? Write it down.

  If your gut agrees with the analysis --> Go to C11.
  If your gut disagrees with the analysis --> Ask: "Does my gut know
  something the analysis missed, or is my gut just scared?"
    If it knows something --> Write down what. Re-evaluate that factor.
    If it is just scared --> Proceed with the analysis answer. Fear of
    change is not information.

---

STEP C11: State your decision.

Write down: "I am choosing [option] because [top 3 reasons].
The biggest risk is [from C9]. I am mitigating it by [action].
I will know this was a good decision if [checkable outcome] by [date].
I consulted [name from C6] who [agreed/disagreed/added perspective]."

You are done.


================================================================================
SECTION D: EMERGENCY DECISIONS
================================================================================
(For: must decide NOW + stakes are not trivial. Pattern: Emergency.)
(Goal: Make a defensible decision in minutes, not hours.)

---

STEP D1: STOP and breathe. Set a timer for 60 seconds. Do nothing for
those 60 seconds except breathe.

(This is not optional. Emergencies trigger fight-or-flight responses that
impair decision-making. 60 seconds of breathing partially counteracts
this.)

What you should see: A 60-second pause completed.

---

STEP D2: Write the decision in one sentence. Use pen and paper if
possible -- it is faster under stress than typing.

---

STEP D3: Do you have a pre-existing plan, policy, or protocol for this
situation?

  (Y) Yes --> Follow that plan. Skip to D7.
  (N) No --> Continue to D4.

(Pre-committed defaults exist for exactly this reason -- emergencies are
the worst time to make novel decisions.)

---

STEP D4: Is there someone available RIGHT NOW who has more expertise
than you in this situation?

  (Y) Yes --> Delegate to them. Tell them: "I need you to decide [one
      sentence from D2]. You have [time available]. I will support
      whatever you choose." Skip to D7.
  (N) No --> Continue to D5.

---

STEP D5: List options. In an emergency, you get 2 minutes for this.
Write fast. You need at least 2 options. "Do nothing" counts as an option.

---

STEP D6: For each option, answer only this: "Which option is LEAST
likely to cause irreversible harm?"

Choose that option.

(In emergencies, minimize downside. Do not try to optimize for the best
outcome -- avoid the worst one.)

---

STEP D7: Act immediately.

---

STEP D8: As soon as the emergency has passed, schedule 30 minutes to
review the decision using SECTION B. Write down what happened and what
you would do differently. This is how you build better pre-existing plans
(D3) for next time.

What you should see: A fast decision made, an action taken, and a review
scheduled.


================================================================================
SECTION E: STUCK DECISIONS
================================================================================
(For: feeling paralyzed, going in circles, or unclear about what you want.
Patterns: Paralysis Trap, Values First.)

The fact that you are in this section means the problem is probably NOT
"which option is best." The problem is usually one of:
  (a) You do not know what you actually want.
  (b) You have too many options.
  (c) You are afraid of choosing wrong.
  (d) The stated decision is not the real decision.

This section figures out which one and routes you accordingly.

---

STEP E1: Write down what you have been going back and forth about.
No structure needed -- just dump it out.

---

STEP E2: Read what you wrote. Answer this question:

"Can I clearly describe what a GOOD outcome looks like?"

  (Y) Yes, I know what I want, I just cannot pick the path -->
      The problem is too many options or fear of choosing. Go to E5.
  (N) No, I am not even sure what I want --> Go to E3.

---

STEP E3: Values clarification.

(Protects against Assumption #5: "I know what I want.")

Do this exercise:

E3a: Think of a time you felt deeply satisfied with a decision you made.
Write down what made it satisfying. Not WHAT you decided -- what about
the RESULT felt good?

E3b: Think of a decision you deeply regret. Write down what made it
bad. Not what you decided -- what about the RESULT felt wrong?

E3c: Look at what you wrote. The satisfying result tells you what you
value. The regretful result tells you what you want to avoid.

Write down: "In this decision, what I actually want is _________ and
what I want to avoid is _________."

  If you can fill in those blanks --> Go to SECTION B, Step B2, using
  these as your desired outcomes.

  If you still cannot fill in those blanks --> Go to E4.

---

STEP E4: Get outside help.

If you have done E3 and still do not know what you want, this decision
may involve value conflicts that are hard to sort out alone.

E4a: Talk to someone you trust -- not about the DECISION, but about what
you want from life in the area this decision affects. (Career, relationships,
money, health -- whatever it touches.)

E4b: Specifically ask them: "What do you think I actually care about
in this area?" Listen to their answer. Write it down.

E4c: Does their answer resonate, even if you would not have said it
yourself?

  (Y) Yes --> Use their framing. Return to E3c.
  (N) No --> You may need more time, a therapist, or a coach. This
      procedure has reached its limit. Write down: "I am not ready to
      make this decision yet" and set a date to revisit it.

---

STEP E5: Reducing option overload.

(For when you know what you want but have too many options or are afraid
to commit.)

E5a: How many options are you considering?

  2 options --> Go to E6.
  3-5 options --> Go to E5b.
  6+ options --> Go to E5c.

E5b (3-5 options): Eliminate options using the "hell yes or no" test.
For each option, ask: "Am I excited about this, or am I keeping it because
I feel like I should?" Cross off anything that is not a genuine "yes."

  If 1-2 remain --> Go to E6.
  If all remain --> Pick the 2 you would be MOST disappointed to lose
  and cross off the rest. Go to E6.

E5c (6+ options): You have too many options to evaluate. Cut to 3:
  - Which option would you pick if you had to decide RIGHT NOW?
  - Which option would you MOST regret not trying?
  - Which option is most different from the first two?
  Keep these 3. Cross off the rest. Go to E5b.

---

STEP E6: The coin flip test.

(This does not make the decision for you. It tells you what you actually
want.)

E6a: Assign option 1 to heads and option 2 to tails.

E6b: Flip a coin (or use a random number generator).

E6c: It landed on [option X]. Notice your IMMEDIATE emotional reaction:

  Relief ("oh good") --> That is your answer. Choose that option.
      Go to SECTION B, Step B9 (pre-mortem) to check for risks, then decide.

  Disappointment ("oh no") --> You wanted the OTHER option. Choose that one.
      Go to SECTION B, Step B9.

  Nothing / neutral --> The options are genuinely equivalent. Pick either
      one. Go to SECTION A, Step A4.

---

---ASSUMPTION CHECK E7---
(Protects against Assumption #17: "Choosing not to decide is not a
decision.")

Before leaving this section, ask: "Am I still not deciding? Am I about
to go back to circling?"

  If yes --> You are choosing the default by not choosing. Write down:
  "By not deciding, I am effectively choosing [whatever happens if I
  do nothing]." Ask: "Is that what I want?"
    If yes --> You have decided. Write it down. You are done.
    If no --> Pick the option from E6 and act on it today. Imperfect
    action beats perfect paralysis.


================================================================================
SECTION F: WHEN TO DELEGATE
================================================================================
(For: when someone else should make or heavily influence this decision.
Pattern: Delegate.)

You are here because the decision has real stakes AND someone with
more expertise exists.

---

STEP F1: Identify the expert.

Write down the name of the person (or type of person) who has made this
type of decision successfully multiple times.

What you should see: A specific name or a role (e.g., "a tax attorney,"
"my doctor," "a structural engineer").

---

STEP F2: Check for conflicts of interest.

Ask: "Does this expert benefit from me choosing a particular option?"

  (Y) Yes --> They can inform but should not decide. Get a SECOND
      expert who does not benefit. Then continue to F3 using the
      unconflicted expert.
  (N) No --> Continue to F3.

---

STEP F3: Give them the right information.

Before asking the expert, prepare:

F3a: The decision in one sentence.
F3b: Your desired outcomes from B2 or C2.
F3c: The options you have identified.
F3d: Any constraints (budget, time, values) they need to respect.

Present ALL of this. Do not just say "what should I do?" -- that gives
them too little to work with.

---

STEP F4: Ask the right question.

Do NOT ask: "What should I do?"
DO ask: "Given what I have told you, what option would you choose and why?"

Write down their answer AND their reasoning.

---

STEP F5: Check their reasoning, not just their answer.

Ask: "What could go wrong with this recommendation?"

If they say "nothing" or get defensive, their recommendation may be
overconfident. Get a second opinion.

If they give you concrete risks, you now have the information you need.

---

STEP F6: Make the decision.

You have expert input. Now return to wherever you came from (SECTION B
or SECTION C) and incorporate what you learned. The expert informs your
decision -- unless you explicitly choose to hand the decision to them
entirely (which is itself a decision you are making).


================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
================================================================================

CARD 1: THE 60-SECOND SORT
---
Reversible + low stakes? --> Decide now, review later. (SECTION A)
Must decide NOW + real stakes? --> 60 seconds breathing, then minimize harm. (SECTION D)
Stuck or confused? --> Clarify what you want first. (SECTION E)
Expert available + high stakes? --> Get their input. (SECTION F)
High stakes + irreversible? --> Full deliberation. (SECTION C)
Everything else? --> Standard process. (SECTION B)
---

CARD 2: THE FIVE QUESTIONS THAT PROTECT YOU
---
1. "Is this actually the decision I need to make?" (Assumption check #1)
2. "What options am I missing?" (Assumption check #2)
3. "What would I choose if I were not afraid?" (Assumption check #4)
4. "What do I actually want to be true afterward?" (Assumption check #5)
5. "Could the worst case ruin me?" (Assumption check #12)
---

CARD 3: RED FLAGS -- STOP AND REASSESS
---
- You keep researching but not deciding. (Procrastination disguised as thoroughness.)
- Everyone you ask agrees with you. (You are only asking allies.)
- You cannot explain your choice to a skeptic. (You may not have real reasons.)
- You feel rushed but there is no actual deadline. (Manufactured urgency.)
- The "obvious" choice makes you feel uneasy. (Your gut is flagging something.)
---


================================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES
================================================================================

MISTAKE 1: Treating a reversible decision as irreversible.
What it looks like: Spending days agonizing over something you could
easily change later.
Fix: Re-do Step 0. If 0A = Y, go to Section A.

MISTAKE 2: Gathering more information when you already have enough.
What it looks like: Reading one more article, asking one more person,
running one more analysis -- and never deciding.
Fix: Do Step B6 honestly. If you cannot name the specific information
that would change your choice, you have enough.

MISTAKE 3: Optimizing for the best outcome instead of avoiding the
worst outcome.
What it looks like: Choosing the option with the highest upside while
ignoring that it also has the worst downside.
Fix: Always do the elimination step (B5 or C5) BEFORE the ranking step
(B7 or C8).

MISTAKE 4: Letting emotions drive without noticing.
What it looks like: Having strong "logical" reasons that happen to
align perfectly with what you already wanted emotionally.
Fix: Do Step B10 or C7 honestly.

MISTAKE 5: Confusing "I cannot decide" with "the options are equal."
What it looks like: Going in circles, unable to pick, assuming this
means the options are equivalent.
Reality: Usually means you do not know what you want (values confusion)
or you are afraid of the wrong choice.
Fix: Go to Section E.

MISTAKE 6: Skipping the writing.
What it looks like: Doing this procedure "in your head."
Why it fails: Your head lies to you. It skips steps, rationalizes, and
forgets what it concluded 5 minutes ago. The writing is what makes this
procedure work. If you did not write it down, you did not do the step.

MISTAKE 7: Deciding not to decide and pretending that is not a decision.
What it looks like: Saying "I will decide later" repeatedly until the
options narrow by themselves.
Fix: Assumption Check E7. Write down what happens by default. Own it.

MISTAKE 8: Asking for advice from people who will just agree with you.
What it looks like: "I talked to three friends and they all think I
should do it!"
Fix: Step C6d -- specifically ask someone to argue AGAINST your
preference.


================================================================================
WHEN TO OVERRIDE THIS PROCEDURE
================================================================================

This procedure is a tool, not a law. Override it when:

1. YOU ARE IN PHYSICAL DANGER.
   Get safe first. Procedures are for when you have the luxury of
   thinking.

2. A DOMAIN EXPERT TELLS YOU THE PROCEDURE IS WRONG FOR THIS CASE.
   A doctor, lawyer, engineer, or other qualified specialist may have
   domain-specific procedures that are better. Use theirs.

3. YOU HAVE DEEP EXPERTISE AND PATTERN RECOGNITION IN THIS EXACT
   DECISION TYPE.
   If you have made this exact type of decision successfully 20+ times,
   your intuition may be better than this procedure. (But: "I have
   opinions about this" is not the same as "I have expertise in this."
   Expertise means track record.)

4. THE DECISION INVOLVES MORAL OR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS.
   Some decisions have a right answer that is not about optimizing
   outcomes. If the law requires X, or your deepest moral convictions
   require X, this procedure may route you to a "better" outcome that
   violates those commitments. Override.

5. YOU DISCOVER THE REAL DECISION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE YOU STARTED
   WITH.
   Any assumption check that reveals a reframing means you should restart
   the procedure with the new framing, not push through with the old one.

WORKED EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: "Should I switch to a new phone plan?"
-----

Step 0:
  0A: Can I undo it? --> (Y) I can switch back.
  0B: Time? --> (W) No deadline.
  0C: Stakes? --> (L) Minor cost difference.
  0D: Stuck? --> (N) Just want to make a good choice.

Routing: 0A=Y, 0C=L --> SECTION A.

Assumption Check A0: "I am deciding between my current plan and the new
plan." Is there a bigger decision? No, this is straightforward.

A1: Options: (1) Keep current plan. (2) Switch to new plan.
A2: Gut says: Switch -- the new plan is cheaper.
A3: Ruin check? No, switching phone plans causes no serious harm.
A4: Review date: 1 month from now.
A5: Decision: Switch to the new plan.

Total time: 3 minutes.

-----

EXAMPLE 2: "Should I accept this job offer?"
-----

Step 0:
  0A: Reversible? --> (N) Quitting my current job is hard to undo.
  0B: Time? --> (D) They want an answer by Friday.
  0C: Stakes? --> (H) Affects income, career, daily life.
  0D: Stuck? --> (N) Not stuck, just want to think carefully.

Routing: 0C=H, 0A=N --> SECTION C.

C0a: "I am deciding whether to accept a job offer at Company X."
C0b: Last possible date: Friday. Cost of one more day: low (I can ask
     for the weekend). --> Ask for the weekend.
C0c: Default (no decision): I stay at current job. Is that acceptable?
     Yes, my current job is fine. But I want to evaluate the opportunity.

C1: Options:
  (1) Accept the offer as-is.
  (2) Decline the offer.
  (3) Negotiate the offer (higher salary, remote days, etc.).
  (4) Ask for a 2-week trial or probation period.
  (5) Accept but negotiate a delayed start date.
  C1a (twice my budget person): Would hire a career coach to evaluate.
  C1c (different values): Would ask "which job lets me travel more?"

C2: Desired outcomes:
  - Earn at least $X/year. (Checkable.)
  - Have flexibility to work from home 2+ days/week. (Checkable.)
  - Work on problems I find interesting. (Somewhat checkable.)
  C2a: Most afraid of: Hating the new job and having burned bridges.
  C2b: Ashamed to want: Honestly, the prestige of the company name.

C3: Who is affected: My spouse (wants stability), my team at current
job (loses a member), my future team (gains one).

C4: Table:
| Option     | Best            | Worst               | Most likely    |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Accept     | Dream job       | Hate it, stuck       | Good, not great|
| Decline    | Current job ok  | Regret for years     | Status quo     |
| Negotiate  | Better offer    | They rescind         | Modest bump    |

C5: "Hate it, stuck" -- can I live with this for 5 years? Not really,
but I COULD leave within a year. So worst case is survivable but painful.
None eliminated.

C6: Called my mentor. She said: "You always do this -- you focus on
salary but what actually matters to you is autonomy. Ask about decision-
making authority, not just money." (This reframed my evaluation.)

C7: Strongest emotion: Excitement. Would I choose differently without it?
Maybe -- I might negotiate harder instead of just accepting.
--> Sleep on it. Next morning: Still want to negotiate + accept.

C8: Weighted ranking (Autonomy ranked #1 after mentor's input):
Negotiate scores (++) on salary, (+) on autonomy if I negotiate for
decision authority too.

C9: Pre-mortem: "I accepted and 2 years later regret it. What happened?
The role was micromanaged. My boss left and the replacement was terrible.
The company culture was not what interviews showed." Preventable: Ask
about management style. Ask to meet the team before accepting. Ask about
turnover.

C10: Gut agrees with analysis: Negotiate for salary + autonomy + meet
the team first.

C11: "I am choosing to negotiate the offer, specifically asking for
(1) a 10% salary increase, (2) clarity on decision-making authority,
and (3) a chance to meet the team. The biggest risk is they rescind.
I am mitigating it by framing requests as enthusiasm, not demands.
I will know this was good if I feel engaged and autonomous at 6 months.
I consulted my mentor who redirected me toward autonomy as the key factor."

Total time: 3 days (including sleeping on it). Appropriate for stakes.

-----

EXAMPLE 3: "I have been trying to decide whether to go back to school
for 6 months and I cannot choose."
-----

Step 0:
  0A: Reversible? --> (N) Major time and money commitment.
  0B: Time? --> (W) Applications due in 3 months.
  0C: Stakes? --> (H) Years of time, significant money.
  0D: Stuck? --> (Y) Going in circles for 6 months.

Routing: 0D=Y --> SECTION E.

E1: "I keep going back and forth. Some days I think school would open
doors, other days I think it is a waste of money. I have looked at
programs but cannot commit to applying. My partner thinks I should go.
My boss thinks I should stay."

E2: Can I describe a good outcome? Not really -- I do not know if I want
the degree for career advancement, for learning, for a credential, or
just because I feel stuck in my current role.

--> Go to E3.

E3a: Satisfying past decision: Moved to a new city 5 years ago. What
felt good: Having a fresh start. Learning new things. Proving I could
handle it.

E3b: Regretted past decision: Stayed in a job I hated for 2 years. What
felt bad: Feeling trapped. Not growing. Doing the same thing every day.

E3c: Pattern: I value growth, novelty, and challenge. I want to avoid
stagnation. "In this decision, what I actually want is to STOP FEELING
STAGNANT and what I want to avoid is ANOTHER PERIOD OF DOING THE SAME
THING."

Wait -- this reframes the decision. The decision is not "should I go
back to school." The decision is "how do I stop feeling stagnant."
School is ONE option. Others: new role at current company, career switch
without a degree, sabbatical, side project.

--> Return to Section C (high stakes, irreversible) with the reframed
decision: "How do I create growth and challenge in my career?"

This is Section E doing its job -- it revealed that the original framing
was wrong (Assumption #1) and that the stated goal was not the real goal
(Assumption #18).

VALIDATION STATUS
================================================================================

This procedure has not been validated by domain experts in decision
science, behavioral economics, or psychology. It is a synthesis of
established decision-making frameworks (two-way door / one-way door
classification, pre-mortem technique, values clarification, expected
value reasoning, satisficing vs. maximizing) organized into a mechanical
format.

Use it as a starting point. Improve it based on your experience. If a
step consistently gives you bad results, drop it or modify it.

The procedure is versioned. This is version 1.0.
