# ARAW-Writing: Systematic Writing Improvement

**Purpose**: Apply ARAW methodology to improve writing quality.

**⚠️ PARADIGM NOTE**: This SKILL file primarily addresses the **argumentative/persuasive paradigm** of writing (strengthen arguments, anticipate objections, logical rigor). Writing has other paradigms that may better serve certain goals:

| Paradigm | Values | Use When |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Argumentative** (this file) | Logic, evidence, counterarguments | Essays, papers, persuasion |
| **Narrative** | Story, emotion, connection | Fiction, memoir, storytelling |
| **Exploratory** | Discovery, questions, thinking-through | Personal essays, journaling, drafting |
| **Expressive** | Voice, style, authenticity | Creative writing, poetry |
| **Informative** | Clarity, accuracy, completeness | Technical docs, instructions |

**Before using this SKILL, ask**: Which paradigm fits your goal?
- If argumentative/persuasive → proceed with this SKILL
- If narrative/exploratory → adapt the process or question whether argument-focused ARAW helps
- If expressive → consider whether logic-focused approach fits

---

## STAGE 0: Paradigm Check (DO THIS FIRST)

**Before applying ARAW to writing, question whether the argumentative paradigm is appropriate.**

```
PARADIGM ARAW:
├── ASSUME RIGHT → Argumentative paradigm is appropriate
│   ├── Goal IS to persuade
│   ├── Goal IS to defend a thesis
│   ├── Goal IS to anticipate and address objections
│   └── → Proceed with SKILL-writing as written
│
└── ASSUME WRONG → Argumentative paradigm may not fit
    ├── Goal might be exploration, not persuasion
    │   └── Consider: What questions would help explore?
    ├── Goal might be narrative, not argument
    │   └── Consider: What story structure would work?
    ├── Goal might be expression, not logic
    │   └── Consider: What voice/style questions matter?
    └── → Adapt process OR acknowledge this SKILL doesn't fit
```

**If paradigm doesn't fit**, either:
1. Acknowledge limitation and suggest what would help
2. Adapt the ARAW questions for user's actual paradigm
3. Use general ARAW instead of SKILL-writing

## When to Use (Argumentative Paradigm)

- Important papers, essays, articles
- Persuasive writing where you need to anticipate objections
- Technical documentation that must cover all cases
- Any writing where logical rigor matters

## Depth Guide

| Writing Type | Recommended Depth | Time Investment |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Blog post | 1x | 15-20 min |
| Essay | 2x | 30-45 min |
| Academic paper | 3x | 1-2 hours |
| Major publication | 4x | 2-3 hours |

## Process (Argumentative Paradigm)

### PHASE 1: ARAW the Thesis

State your main claim, then explore both directions:

```
THESIS: "[Your main argument]"
│
├── ASSUME RIGHT → Thesis is correct
│   ├── What follows logically from this?
│   │   └── List implications readers must accept
│   ├── What evidence supports this?
│   │   ├── Strongest evidence (lead with this)
│   │   ├── Moderate evidence (include)
│   │   └── Weak evidence (maybe cut)
│   ├── What does success look like?
│   │   └── If thesis is true, what world do we see?
│   └── What related claims are implied?
│       └── [These may need their own sections]
│
└── ASSUME WRONG → Thesis is false or incomplete
    ├── What are the counterarguments?
    │   ├── Strongest counterargument → ADDRESS THIS IN TEXT
    │   ├── Common objections → ANTICIPATE THESE
    │   └── Overlooked objections → SURPRISE READERS BY ADDRESSING
    ├── What alternative theses exist?
    │   ├── Opposite thesis
    │   ├── Nuanced/qualified thesis
    │   └── Reframed thesis
    ├── What would falsify this thesis?
    │   └── These become scope limits or concessions
    └── Who disagrees and why?
        └── Understanding opposition strengthens your argument
```

**Output from Phase 1:**
- Refined thesis (possibly qualified)
- List of counterarguments to address
- Evidence hierarchy (strong → weak)
- Scope limitations to acknowledge

---

### PHASE 2: ARAW Each Major Argument

For each supporting argument in your piece:

```
ARGUMENT: "[Supporting claim]"
│
├── ASSUME RIGHT → Argument is valid
│   ├── What does it actually prove?
│   │   └── Often less than we think
│   ├── How strong is it?
│   │   └── Rate: Conclusive / Strong / Moderate / Weak
│   ├── What does it depend on?
│   │   └── Hidden assumptions that need stating
│   └── Does it actually support the thesis?
│       └── Sometimes arguments are tangential
│
└── ASSUME WRONG → Argument has holes
    ├── What's the weakness?
    │   └── Every argument has one - find it before readers do
    ├── What counterexample exists?
    │   └── Even hypothetical ones matter
    ├── What's the strongest objection?
    │   └── This should appear in your text
    └── Should this argument be cut?
        └── Weak arguments can hurt overall case
```

**Actions from Phase 2:**
- Strengthen arguments where AW found weaknesses
- Add qualifications where needed
- Cut arguments that don't survive AW
- Note objections to address in text

---

### PHASE 3: Structure from ARAW Output

Convert your ARAW analysis into writing structure:

```
INTRODUCTION
├── State thesis
├── Acknowledge complexity (from AW branches)
│   └── "While some argue X, I will show Y"
└── Preview main arguments

BODY SECTIONS
├── For each major argument:
│   ├── State the argument
│   ├── Provide evidence (from AR branches)
│   ├── Address objection (from AW branches)
│   └── Connect back to thesis
│
└── Key technique: Use AW findings proactively
    └── "One might object that... However..."

COUNTERARGUMENTS SECTION (if appropriate)
├── Present strongest AW paths
├── Rebut them
└── This builds credibility

CONCLUSION
├── Restate thesis with nuance gained from ARAW
├── Acknowledge remaining uncertainties (GUESS claims)
└── Strong close on FOUNDATIONAL claims
```

---

### PHASE 4: Clarity Check

ARAW forces explicit claims. Use this for clarity:

```
FOR EACH PARAGRAPH:
├── What is the ONE claim this paragraph makes?
│   └── If unclear, rewrite
├── Is this claim stated explicitly?
│   └── Don't make readers guess
├── Does every sentence support this claim?
│   └── Cut sentences that don't
└── Would someone who disagrees understand what you're claiming?
    └── Clarity ≠ agreement, but clarity is required
```

## Quick Reference: What ARAW Catches in Writing

| Problem | How ARAW Catches It |
|---------|---------------------|
| Weak arguments | AW branch finds counterexamples |
| Logical gaps | AW branch asks "does this really follow?" |
| Missing objections | AW branches generate objections |
| Overstated claims | AW branch tests scope |
| Hidden assumptions | Claim identification surfaces them |
| Poor structure | ARAW output suggests natural structure |
| Unclear thesis | Forced to state precisely for ARAW |
| Tangential content | AW asks "does this support thesis?" |

## Example: ARAW-Writing on a Thesis

**Original thesis**: "Social media is bad for society"

**After ARAW Phase 1:**

```
ASSUME RIGHT → Social media is bad
├── Evidence: Mental health studies, polarization data, misinformation spread
├── Implies: We should reduce use, regulate platforms, or redesign
└── Success: Less social media → better outcomes

ASSUME WRONG → Social media is not (entirely) bad
├── Counterarguments:
│   ├── STRONG: Enables connection for isolated people
│   ├── STRONG: Democratizes information access
│   ├── MODERATE: Economic benefits (jobs, businesses)
│   └── WEAK: "People like it" (preference ≠ good)
├── Alternative theses:
│   ├── "Current social media design is bad" (more precise)
│   ├── "Social media is bad for some people/uses" (qualified)
│   └── "Social media's benefits don't outweigh costs" (comparative)
└── What would falsify: Evidence that benefits > harms overall
```

**Refined thesis**: "Current social media platform designs prioritize engagement over wellbeing, causing measurable harm that outweighs their benefits for most users"

This is:
- More precise (current designs, not social media concept)
- More defensible (measurable harm)
- Acknowledges scope (most users, not all)
- Addresses strongest counterargument implicitly (benefits exist but are outweighed)

## Integration with Main ARAW

ARAW-Writing is a specialization of the main ARAW skill. Key differences:

| Aspect | Main ARAW | ARAW-Writing |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Focus | Finding truth | Improving communication |
| Output | Analysis | Revised writing |
| AW use | Find alternatives | Find objections to address |
| Commitment | What to believe | What to claim |
| Depth | Match complexity | Match stakes of writing |

You can invoke as: `/araw-writing [thesis or piece]`

Or use main ARAW with writing focus: `/araw 2x [thesis] --focus=writing`
