# Universal Goal Analysis Framework v2

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The comprehensive question framework that applies to EVERY goal, regardless of domain.

v2.0 principles: Questions must yield actionable answers. Answers should be facts, not opinions. No excuse-enabling questions. Closed questions with qualifiers, not open-ended. Literal language, no jargon. Flip to opposite framing when more useful. Every question tested against: "Does this help figure out how to get there, what to do once there, and how conditions change?"

## Steps

### Step 1: GOAL SPECIFICATION
1. What is the measurable end state? (Not "improve X" — what number, by when?)
2. What changes when this goal is achieved? (Observable difference)
3. Has this specific goal been achieved by someone in a comparable situation? Who?
4. What is the cost of NOT achieving this goal in 12 months?
5. What must be true for you to know you've succeeded? (Specific test)

### Step 2: CURRENT STATE FACTS
1. What is the current measurable state on the goal dimension?
2. What is the gap between current state and goal? (Number, not feeling)
3. What resources are currently allocated to this goal? (Hours/week, $/month)
4. What has been tried in the last 90 days? What was the result of each attempt?
5. What is the rate of change? (Getting closer, further, or static?)

### Step 3: OBSTACLE IDENTIFICATION
1. List every specific thing blocking progress. For each:
   - Is this obstacle within your control to remove? (Y/N)
   - What would removing it cost? (Time, money, effort)
   - Has anyone removed this obstacle before? How?
2. Which single obstacle, if removed, would create the most progress?
3. Are any obstacles actually preferences disguised as constraints? (Won't vs can't)

### Step 4: ACTION SPECIFICATION
1. What is the single next action that would move the goal forward?
2. When specifically will it be done? (Date and time, not "soon")
3. What is the specific output of that action? (Not "work on X" — what deliverable?)
4. What prevents doing this action right now?
5. If you had to achieve 80% of this goal in half the time, what would you do differently?

### Step 5: RESOURCE ANALYSIS
1. What skills are required that you currently have?
2. What skills are required that you don't have? How will you get them? (Learn/hire/partner)
3. What money is required? Is it available? If not, how to get it?
4. What time is required per week? Is it allocated? What will you stop doing to make room?
5. What people are required? Are they committed?

### Step 6: RISK AND CONTINGENCY
1. What is the most likely way this fails? (Not worst case — most likely failure)
2. If that failure happens, what is the recovery plan?
3. What is the point of no return? (After which, you can't easily reverse)
4. What information would cause you to abandon this goal?

### Step 7: PROGRESS TRACKING
1. What will you measure weekly to know if you're on track?
2. What is the target value for that metric at 30/60/90 days?
3. What will you do if the metric shows you're behind at 30 days?
4. Who besides you will see this metric? (Accountability)

### Step 8: Report
```
GOAL ANALYSIS v2:
Goal: [specific, measurable]
Current: [measurable state]
Gap: [number]

Top obstacle: [most impactful blocker]
Next action: [specific, with date]
Key metric: [what to measure weekly]
Most likely failure: [and contingency]
```

## When to Use
- Any new goal
- Any goal that feels stuck
- Periodic review of ongoing goals
- → See also: /ugav3, /ugav4, /ugav5 for later versions
- → INVOKE: /gu (goal understanding) for initial goal clarification

## Verification
- [ ] All answers are facts, not opinions
- [ ] Actions are specific with dates
- [ ] Obstacles are concrete and classified (controllable vs not)
- [ ] Metrics are measurable and tracked
- [ ] Risk has contingency plan
