# Design Thinking + Lean Startup

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Two complementary methodologies for innovation:

**Design Thinking**: Discover user needs through empathy, generate creative solutions, and prototype iteratively. Good for finding the right problem.

**Lean Startup**: Test business assumptions through minimum viable products and validated learning. Good for testing whether solutions work.

Combined: Design Thinking discovers what to build, Lean Startup validates whether you should build it.

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine Phase
Where are you in the innovation process?

| If you... | Use | Phase |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Don't know the problem | Design Thinking | Empathize + Define |
| Know the problem, need solutions | Design Thinking | Ideate + Prototype |
| Have a solution, need validation | Lean Startup | Build-Measure-Learn |
| Have validation, need scale | Neither — this is execution | → INVOKE: /action |

### Step 2: Design Thinking — Empathize
Understand the user's actual experience:

1. **Observe**: Watch users in their natural context. What do they DO (not just say)?
2. **Interview**: Ask open-ended questions. "Tell me about the last time you..."
3. **Experience**: Try being the user yourself. Feel the friction.
4. **Map the journey**: What steps do they go through? Where is the pain?

```
EMPATHY MAP:
Says: [what the user tells you]
Does: [what you observe them doing]
Thinks: [what they might be thinking — inferred]
Feels: [emotional state — frustrated, anxious, bored]

Key pain points:
1. [pain] — severity: [H/M/L]
2. [pain]

Unmet needs:
1. [need they expressed]
2. [need they didn't express but you observed]
```

### Step 3: Design Thinking — Define
Turn empathy into a problem statement:

**Point of View (POV) format:**
"[User] needs to [need] because [insight]."

**Quality checks:**
- Is the need real (observed, not assumed)?
- Is it specific enough to solve?
- Does it frame the problem WITHOUT implying a solution?
- Is it big enough to matter?

### Step 4: Design Thinking — Ideate
Generate many possible solutions:

1. **Diverge**: Generate as many ideas as possible (quantity over quality)
   - No judging during divergence
   - Build on others' ideas
   - Encourage wild ideas
   - Go for volume (aim for 20+ ideas)

2. **Converge**: Select the most promising
   - Which ideas address the core need?
   - Which are feasible?
   - Which are novel?
   - Select 3-5 to prototype

### Step 5: Design Thinking — Prototype
Build the simplest version that can be tested:

| Prototype Type | Speed | Fidelity | Best For |
|---------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Paper sketch | Hours | Low | Concept testing |
| Clickable mockup | Days | Medium | Flow testing |
| Wizard of Oz | Days | Medium | Service testing (human behind the curtain) |
| Concierge | Days | High | High-touch service testing |
| Landing page | Days | Medium | Demand testing |
| Functional MVP | Weeks | High | Full solution testing |

Rule: Use the LOWEST fidelity that can answer your question.

### Step 6: Lean Startup — Build-Measure-Learn
Now validate with real users:

**Identify the riskiest assumption:**
1. What must be TRUE for this solution to work?
2. Which assumption, if wrong, kills the idea?
3. Test THAT assumption first

**Build**: Create minimum viable test
- What's the smallest thing you can build to test the assumption?
- It should be embarrassingly simple

**Measure**: Define success criteria BEFORE testing
- What metric will tell you if the assumption is true?
- What number is "good enough"?
- How many data points do you need?

**Learn**: Analyze results honestly
- Did the assumption hold?
- YES → test next riskiest assumption
- NO → pivot (change approach) or persevere (more data needed)

### Step 7: Pivot or Persevere
After each Build-Measure-Learn cycle:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Metrics meet success criteria | Persevere — test next assumption |
| Metrics close to criteria | Iterate — refine, don't restart |
| Metrics far from criteria | Pivot — change approach |
| No one uses the test | Pivot — problem may not be real |

**Pivot types:**
- Customer pivot: Same product, different audience
- Problem pivot: Same audience, different problem
- Solution pivot: Same problem, different solution
- Channel pivot: Same product, different distribution
- Revenue model pivot: Same product, different monetization

### Step 8: Report
```
DESIGN THINKING + LEAN:
Phase: [empathize / define / ideate / prototype / validate]

Design Thinking findings:
User: [who]
Need: [what]
Insight: [why]
Solution concept: [what we're testing]

Lean Startup validation:
Riskiest assumption: [what must be true]
Test: [what we built/did]
Metric: [what we measured]
Result: [what happened]
Decision: [persevere / iterate / pivot]

Next step: [what to do next based on learnings]
```

## When to Use
- Developing new products or services
- Solving ambiguous problems
- When unsure what users actually need
- Validating business assumptions
- Reducing waste by learning before building
- → INVOKE: /cd (customer development) for deeper customer insight
- → INVOKE: /prd (product design) for product specification

## Verification
- [ ] User needs discovered through observation (not just assumption)
- [ ] Problem defined without implying solution
- [ ] Multiple solutions ideated before selecting one
- [ ] Prototype is minimum fidelity needed
- [ ] Riskiest assumption identified and tested first
- [ ] Success criteria defined before testing
- [ ] Pivot/persevere decision based on data
