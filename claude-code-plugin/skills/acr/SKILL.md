# Active Recall

## Overview
Use retrieval practice and self-testing to strengthen learning and identify gaps

## Steps

### Step 1: Initial learning phase
Before active recall, ensure adequate initial exposure:
1. Read/watch/attend to the material actively
2. Take brief notes (not transcription - key points)
3. Pause periodically to check understanding
4. Don't over-learn before first retrieval attempt
5. Understand that felt mastery ≠ actual mastery

Minimum initial learning:
- Can explain what the material is about
- Have identified key concepts and terms
- Know what you're supposed to learn
- NOT: Feel like you "know" it all

Warning: The familiarity from initial exposure
creates an illusion of competence. Active recall
will reveal actual knowledge state.

### Step 2: First retrieval attempt
Test yourself before you feel "ready":
1. Close all materials
2. Choose retrieval technique appropriate to material
3. Attempt to recall without any aids
4. Note confidence level during recall
5. Record both what you recalled and what you couldn't

Timing guidance:
- First attempt: Soon after initial learning (same day)
- Don't wait until you feel confident - test early

Important: Don't peek during retrieval
- Struggling is productive (desirable difficulty)
- Partial retrieval followed by checking works
- Looking at answers during recall defeats the purpose

### Step 3: Feedback and correction
Review performance and correct errors:
1. Compare retrieval to source material
2. Mark what was correct, incorrect, and missing
3. For incorrect items, understand why the error occurred
4. Study missed material (but don't over-study)
5. Note patterns in what was difficult

Feedback timing:
- Immediate feedback after attempt is ideal
- Delayed feedback (a day) can also be effective
- Never skip feedback - it's essential for learning

Error analysis:
- Didn't encode initially? (Re-learn)
- Encoded but couldn't retrieve? (Practice more)
- Retrieved wrong thing? (Clear up confusion)
- Partial recall? (Strengthen connections)

### Step 4: Identify true knowledge state
Use retrieval performance to calibrate understanding:
1. Compare felt confidence to actual performance
2. Identify illusions of competence (felt known, wasn't)
3. Identify underconfidence (felt unknown, actually knew)
4. Map knowledge: what's solid, what's fragile, what's missing
5. Accept retrieval results as true knowledge indicator

Knowledge state categories:
- Solid: Recalled correctly with confidence
- Fragile: Recalled but with difficulty or partial errors
- Illusion: Felt known but couldn't recall
- Missing: Never encoded or completely forgotten
- Confusion: Recalled wrong information confidently

Metacognitive calibration:
- Retrieval results > feelings about knowledge
- Overconfidence is common; let data correct it
- This is valuable information, not failure

### Step 5: Targeted review
Focus additional study on identified gaps:
1. Prioritize: fragile > illusion > missing
2. Re-study missed material actively (not passive reread)
3. Create retrieval cues for difficult items
4. Connect difficult items to known information
5. Plan next retrieval attempt for these items

Targeted strategies by gap type:
- Fragile: More retrieval practice, strengthen cues
- Illusion: Active re-encoding, test again soon
- Missing: Initial learning wasn't adequate, re-learn
- Confusion: Clarify correct information, distinct encoding

Don't over-study:
- Goal is to be ready for next retrieval, not to "finish"
- Better to space multiple shorter study sessions

### Step 6: Successive retrieval attempts
Continue retrieval practice with spacing:
1. Schedule next retrieval attempt (allow time to forget slightly)
2. Test again using same or different techniques
3. Repeat feedback and correction cycle
4. Track progress across attempts
5. Extend intervals as performance improves

Spacing guidelines:
- Second attempt: 1-3 days after first
- Third attempt: 1 week after second
- Continue extending as material stabilizes
- Return to shorter intervals if performance drops

Variation:
- Use different retrieval techniques across attempts
- Vary the questions/prompts
- Retrieve in different contexts if possible
- Builds more flexible knowledge

### Step 7: Integration and application
Connect retrieved knowledge to use contexts:
1. Practice retrieval in varied conditions
2. Apply recalled knowledge to problems/scenarios
3. Connect to other knowledge (elaboration)
4. Retrieve under conditions similar to actual use
5. Maintain with periodic retrieval (or transfer to SRS)

Transfer to use:
- Retrieval practice builds recall ability
- Application practice builds use ability
- Both are needed for functional knowledge

Maintenance:
- Knowledge will fade without use
- Periodic retrieval maintains it
- For critical knowledge, use spaced repetition system
- For applied knowledge, use in practice maintains it


## When to Use
- Studying for exams requiring recall (not just recognition)
- Consolidating learning from lectures, readings, or courses
- Self-assessing actual knowledge (vs. felt familiarity)
- Identifying gaps in understanding before they matter
- Making new learning stick for long-term use
- Any learning where you need to produce, not just recognize
- Preparing for situations requiring retrieval under pressure
- When rereading doesn't seem to be working

## Verification
- Retrieval is attempted before feeling "ready"
- Retrieval is effortful (not just recognition)
- Feedback follows all retrieval attempts
- Knowledge state is based on retrieval performance, not feelings
- Gaps are identified and targeted for study
- Multiple retrieval attempts with spacing
- Retrieval practice varied across attempts
