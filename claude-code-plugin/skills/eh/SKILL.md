# Epistemic Hierarchy

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

A layered framework for building from certain foundations toward determinate action. Each level provides different certainty and different utility.

The hierarchy:
- Level 0: Undeniable certainties (experience exists)
- Level 1: Pragmatic necessities (invariant across metaphysical views)
- Level 1.5: Ethical constraints (hard to reject without incoherence)
- Level 2: Empirical regularities (contingent but testable)
- Level 3: Situation-specific derivations (from above + specifics)

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify What Needs Grounding
1. What claim, decision, or action needs epistemic justification?
2. What level of certainty is required? (Life-or-death vs casual recommendation)
3. What is currently assumed without justification?

### Step 2: Level 0 — Undeniable Certainties
Things that cannot be coherently denied:

- **Experience exists.** You are having an experience right now. Denying this requires having the experience of denying.
- **Something is happening.** The content might be illusory, but the occurrence isn't.
- **Logic operates.** To argue against logic, you must use logic.
- **Change occurs.** Your experience includes temporal sequence.

**Use:** These provide absolute bedrock. If your reasoning traces back to Level 0, it's on solid ground. But Level 0 is thin — it doesn't tell you WHAT to do.

### Step 3: Level 1 — Pragmatic Necessities
Things that any agent must assume to function, regardless of metaphysical position:

- **Actions have consequences** (even if the mechanism is mysterious)
- **Some outcomes are preferable to others** (even if "preference" is constructed)
- **Information reduces uncertainty** (even if "certainty" is unreachable)
- **Patterns exist and tend to persist** (even if they're not guaranteed)
- **Other agents exist with their own perspectives** (even if solipsism can't be disproven)

**Use:** These support planning and decision-making. If your strategy assumes only Level 1 premises, it works across worldviews.

### Step 4: Level 1.5 — Ethical Constraints
Things difficult to reject without becoming incoherent:

- **Consistency requirement**: Apply the same standards to yourself as others
- **Suffering matters**: Hard to coherently claim suffering is irrelevant while avoiding your own
- **Honesty as default**: Deception requires truth to parasitize; truth doesn't require deception
- **Consent and autonomy**: Using others as mere tools requires denying your own agency

**Use:** These constrain HOW you pursue goals. Strategies that violate Level 1.5 tend to be self-undermining.

### Step 5: Level 2 — Empirical Regularities
Things we observe to be true, testable but not guaranteed:

- Physical laws (gravity, thermodynamics, etc.)
- Biological patterns (nutrition, sleep, aging)
- Psychological patterns (motivation, habit, bias)
- Social patterns (markets, institutions, culture)
- Domain-specific knowledge (medicine, engineering, etc.)

**Use:** These power specific strategies. They're contingent — they COULD be wrong — but they're our best current models. Always hold Level 2 claims more loosely than Level 0-1.

### Step 6: Level 3 — Situation-Specific Derivations
Conclusions drawn from combining higher levels with specific context:

- "Given [Level 2 knowledge] and [my specific situation], I should [action]"
- These are the most useful but least certain
- They inherit the uncertainty of every level they depend on
- They're also most sensitive to context (what works for one person may not work for another)

### Step 7: Apply to Input
For the input claim/decision/action:

1. **Trace it to its epistemic level:**
   - What level does this claim live at?
   - What levels do its premises come from?
   - Where is the weakest link?

2. **Check for level violations:**
   - Is a Level 3 claim being treated as Level 0? (Overconfidence)
   - Is a Level 0 truth being ignored? (Ignoring foundations)
   - Are Level 2 patterns being treated as certainties? (Mistaking models for reality)

3. **Calibrate confidence:**
   - Level 0: Virtually certain
   - Level 1: Practically certain (needed to function)
   - Level 1.5: Very high confidence (rejection is incoherent)
   - Level 2: High confidence but revisable
   - Level 3: Moderate confidence, context-dependent

### Step 8: Report
```
EPISTEMIC HIERARCHY ANALYSIS:
Subject: [what was analyzed]

Level mapping:
| Claim/Premise | Level | Confidence | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-------|
| [claim] | [0-3] | [certainty] | [caveats] |

Weakest link: [which premise is at the lowest/most uncertain level]
Level violations: [any miscalibrations found]
Grounding assessment: [how well-grounded is the overall argument]

Recommendation:
- If well-grounded: [proceed with calibrated confidence]
- If poorly grounded: [what would strengthen it — trace to higher levels]
```

## When to Use
- When grounding axioms for deductive strategy
- When determining certainty level of premises
- When asking "how do I know this?"
- When building RCI chains that reach foundational questions
- When distinguishing solid ground from assumptions
- → INVOKE: /rci (recursive causal interrogation) for tracing reasons backward
- → INVOKE: /tp (truth propagation) for propagating certainty through arguments

## Verification
- [ ] Claims assigned to correct epistemic level
- [ ] No level violations (treating uncertain as certain or vice versa)
- [ ] Weakest links identified
- [ ] Confidence calibrated to epistemic level
- [ ] Recommendations appropriate to grounding quality
