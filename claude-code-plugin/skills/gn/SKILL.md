# Generation

## Overview
Generate all possible options for a decision or selection

## Steps

### Step 1: Clarify generation target
State clearly what options we're generating for.
- What decision needs options?
- What are we choosing between?
- What level of specificity? (categories vs specific items)

### Step 2: Identify option categories
Before generating individual options, map the space of possibilities:
- What dimensions do options vary on? (cost, speed, risk, etc.)
- What categories of solutions exist?
- What domains might have relevant approaches?

### Step 3: Generate within each category
For each category:
1. List obvious options (what comes to mind first)
2. List unconventional options (what's unusual or creative)
3. List extreme options (what if time/money were no object)
4. List cross-domain options (what works in other fields)

### Step 4: Cross-pollinate
Look for combinations and variations:
- Can options from different categories be combined?
- Are there variations (bigger/smaller, faster/slower)?
- What would the opposite of common options look like?

### Step 5: Check completeness
Review option list for gaps:
- Are any obvious categories missing?
- Did we consider all relevant domains?
- Are constraints artificially limiting us?

### Step 6: Compile final list
Merge all options into single list:
1. Combine raw_options and combined_options
2. Remove exact duplicates
3. Add brief description to each
4. Tag with category for later filtering


## When to Use
- Generating solution options for a problem
- Brainstorming approaches to a goal
- Listing possible materials, resources, or methods
- Finding all possible paths forward
- At strategy discovery phase in GOSM
- When feeling stuck with only obvious options

## Verification
- Option list has breadth (multiple categories represented)
- Unconventional options included (not just obvious choices)
- No premature filtering (options aren't judged/removed)
- Generation gaps acknowledged (know what might be missing)
