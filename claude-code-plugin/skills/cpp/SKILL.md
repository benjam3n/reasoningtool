# Career Path Planning

## Overview
Strategic framework for assessing career options, planning transitions,
identifying skill gaps, and making intentional career decisions.

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess your current state
Honest inventory of where you are now:

1. Current role assessment:
   - What do you do day-to-day?
   - What's your level/seniority?
   - How are you performing?
   - What's your compensation?
   - How long have you been in this role?

2. Satisfaction analysis:
   Rate 1-10 and explain:
   - Work content (do you enjoy the actual tasks?)
   - Growth (are you learning and developing?)
   - Compensation (fairly paid for your value?)
   - Culture (alignment with values, colleagues?)
   - Impact (does your work matter?)
   - Work-life (sustainable pace, flexibility?)

3. Trajectory assessment:
   - Where does current path lead in 3-5 years?
   - Is that where you want to be?
   - What's holding you back (if anything)?

### Step 2: Clarify values and priorities
Understand what actually matters to you:

1. Values clarification:
   Rank importance (1-5) of:
   - Compensation/wealth
   - Status/prestige
   - Impact/meaning
   - Autonomy/freedom
   - Learning/growth
   - Stability/security
   - Work-life balance
   - Creative expression
   - Leadership/influence
   - Relationships/community

2. Life stage considerations:
   - What are your financial obligations?
   - Family considerations (current and planned)?
   - Geographic preferences or constraints?
   - Health considerations?
   - Time horizon (years until retirement)?

3. Identify non-negotiables:
   - What would you never sacrifice?
   - What must any career path include?
   - What are absolute deal-breakers?

4. The "regret minimization" test:
   - At 80, looking back, what would you regret not trying?
   - What would you regret spending your life doing?

### Step 3: Inventory your assets
Catalog what you bring to the table:

1. Skills inventory:
   Technical skills:
   - What tools, technologies, methods do you know?
   - What would you rate yourself on each?

   Transferable skills:
   - Communication, leadership, analysis
   - Project management, negotiation, teaching
   - Which are your strongest?

   Domain knowledge:
   - Industries you know deeply
   - Functions you understand
   - Networks you have access to

2. Achievements inventory:
   - Biggest accomplishments
   - Results you've driven
   - Problems you've solved
   - Things you've built or shipped

3. Unique combinations:
   - What unusual combination of skills do you have?
   - Where do you have rare experience?
   - What's your "unfair advantage"?

4. Credentials:
   - Education and certifications
   - Reputation and brand
   - Portfolio and evidence of work

### Step 4: Generate career options
Brainstorm possible paths without judgment:

1. Start with your current path:
   - Stay in current role (optimize it)
   - Advance in current function (next level)
   - Lateral move in current company
   - Same role at different company

2. Explore adjacent moves:
   - What functions use your skills?
   - What industries value your experience?
   - What roles are natural next steps?

3. Consider transformational moves:
   - Complete career change (new function, new industry)
   - Entrepreneurship
   - Retirement/semi-retirement
   - Sabbatical/break

4. Research options:
   - LinkedIn: What paths have similar people taken?
   - Informational interviews: How did people get to roles you admire?
   - Job postings: What's the market for various paths?

5. Generate at least 5-7 distinct options
   - Include some "safe" options
   - Include some "stretch" options
   - Include at least one "wild card"

### Step 5: Evaluate options
Assess each option systematically:

1. For each option, evaluate:
   Fit:
   - Does it align with your values?
   - Does it use your strengths?
   - Would you enjoy the work?

   Feasibility:
   - What's required to pursue this path?
   - Do you have or can you get the qualifications?
   - Is the market accessible?

   Reward:
   - What's the upside if it works?
   - What does success look like?
   - Does it lead where you want to go?

   Risk:
   - What could go wrong?
   - What's the worst case?
   - Is it recoverable if it fails?

2. Score each option:
   - Create weighted scorecard based on your values
   - Compare options on same criteria
   - Note intuitive reaction vs analytical score

3. Reality-test top options:
   - Talk to people on that path
   - Understand day-to-day reality
   - Identify hidden downsides

### Step 6: Identify gaps and requirements
For your top 1-2 options, determine what's needed:

1. Skills gaps:
   - What skills do you lack?
   - How critical are they vs nice-to-have?
   - How long to develop them?

2. Experience gaps:
   - What experience is required?
   - How can you get it (current role, side projects, volunteer)?
   - What's the shortest path?

3. Credential gaps:
   - Are specific degrees/certifications required?
   - Are they actually required or just common?
   - Cost/time to obtain?

4. Network gaps:
   - Who do you need to know?
   - How can you build relevant relationships?
   - Who can help you transition?

5. Financial requirements:
   - Any income gap during transition?
   - Investment needed (education, job search)?
   - Runway required?

### Step 7: Create development plan
Build plan to close gaps and execute transition:

1. Prioritize gap closure:
   - Which gaps are blocking?
   - Which have highest ROI to close?
   - What order to address them?

2. Create learning plan:
   - Specific courses, certifications, or training
   - Reading and self-study
   - Mentorship and coaching
   - Timeline and milestones

3. Create experience plan:
   - Projects to take on (current role or side)
   - Volunteer or pro-bono work
   - Internal transfers or rotations
   - Freelance or consulting

4. Create network plan:
   - Events and communities to join
   - People to connect with
   - Informational interviews to conduct
   - Mentors to cultivate

5. Create transition timeline:
   - When to start making moves
   - Key milestones and decision points
   - Contingency if timeline slips

6. Design experiments:
   - Low-cost ways to test the path
   - Side projects that simulate the work
   - Conversations that provide information

### Step 8: Execute and iterate
Take action and adjust based on learning:

1. Start immediately:
   - What can you do this week?
   - First experiment or conversation
   - Begin gap closure activities

2. Regular review cadence:
   - Monthly: Am I making progress?
   - Quarterly: Is the path still right?
   - Annually: Major reassessment

3. Gather feedback:
   - Information from experiments
   - Input from mentors and advisors
   - Market signals from applications

4. Adjust as needed:
   - Plans will change; that's normal
   - New information may redirect path
   - Stay flexible while committed

5. Know when you've arrived:
   - Recognize when you've achieved a milestone
   - Celebrate progress
   - Set new goals


## When to Use
- Feeling stuck or unfulfilled in current role
- Considering a major career change
- Evaluating promotion vs lateral move vs new company
- Re-entering workforce after break
- Starting career (graduate, career changer)
- Mid-career reassessment (often around 30, 40, 50)
- Industry disruption threatening current path

## Verification
- Values clarified and prioritized
- Multiple options generated and evaluated
- Gap analysis is specific and honest
- Development plan has concrete actions and timeline
- Experiments designed before major commitment
- Taking action, not just analyzing
