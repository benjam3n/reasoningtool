# Universal Goal Analysis Framework v4

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

The comprehensive question framework that applies to EVERY goal, regardless of domain.

v4.0 improvements:
- Added COMMUNICATION category
- Added LEVERAGE ANALYSIS with recursive requirement tracing
- Expanded ACTION ANALYSIS with multi-dimensional comparison
- All questions follow "is there" before "what is" pattern
- Recursive structures for tracing requirement chains
- Cost analysis at each requirement level
- No assumptions about problems existing before asking if they exist

## Steps

### Step 1: GOAL UNDERSTANDING
Before analyzing, understand what's actually wanted:

1. Is there a specific, measurable outcome desired? → What is it?
2. Is there a deadline or timeline? → What is it?
3. Is there a reason this goal matters now? → What changed?
4. Is this the REAL goal, or is it instrumental to something deeper? → Trace to root desire
5. Has this goal been attempted before? → What happened?
6. → INVOKE: /gu (goal understanding) for deep goal clarification

### Step 2: SITUATION ANALYSIS
Understand the current state:

1. Is there a gap between current state and goal? → How large?
2. Are there resources currently available? → What are they?
3. Are there constraints? → What can't change?
4. Are there stakeholders affected? → Who, and what do they want?
5. Is there existing momentum? → In which direction?
6. Are there deadlines or windows of opportunity? → When do they close?

### Step 3: LEVERAGE ANALYSIS (New in v4)
Find where small effort produces big results:

**Recursive requirement tracing:**
1. What does the goal require? (List requirements R1, R2, R3...)
2. For each requirement: what does THAT require? (Recurse)
3. Continue until you reach things you already have or can easily get
4. At each level, estimate: cost to acquire, time to acquire, alternatives

```
Goal
├── R1: [requirement]
│   ├── R1.1: [sub-requirement] — have: Y/N — cost: [X]
│   └── R1.2: [sub-requirement] — have: Y/N — cost: [X]
├── R2: [requirement]
│   └── R2.1: [sub-requirement] — have: Y/N — cost: [X]
└── R3: [requirement]
    ├── R3.1: [sub-requirement] — have: Y/N — cost: [X]
    └── R3.2: [sub-requirement] — have: Y/N — cost: [X]
```

**Leverage identification:**
- Which requirement, if met, would make others easier?
- Which requirement has the best cost-to-impact ratio?
- Which requirement is the bottleneck?

### Step 4: STRATEGY ANALYSIS
How to get from current state to goal:

1. Is there a known, proven path? → What is it? Why not just follow it?
2. Are there multiple approaches? → What are they?
3. For each approach:
   - What is the mechanism? (HOW does it work, causally?)
   - What assumptions does it rest on?
   - What has to go right?
   - What could go wrong?
   - What's the cost?
4. Is there an unconventional approach worth considering?
5. → INVOKE: /ie (innovation engine) for non-obvious strategies

### Step 5: ACTION ANALYSIS (Expanded in v4)
Multi-dimensional comparison of possible actions:

| Action | Impact | Effort | Risk | Reversibility | Learning Value | Speed |
|--------|--------|--------|------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| [action] | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L |

**Action prioritization:**
1. Is there a single action that would create the most progress? → Do it first
2. Are there prerequisite actions? → Do those first
3. Are there quick wins that build momentum? → Consider starting there
4. Are there irreversible actions? → Delay until confident

### Step 6: RISK ANALYSIS
What could prevent success:

1. Is there a risk of failure? → What are the failure modes?
2. For each failure mode:
   - How likely? (1-5)
   - How severe? (1-5)
   - How detectable? (Can you see it coming?)
   - What's the mitigation?
3. Is there a risk of success? → What changes if you achieve the goal?
4. Is there a risk of inaction? → What happens if you do nothing?

### Step 7: COMMUNICATION (New in v4)
Who needs to know what:

1. Is there anyone who needs to be informed? → Who and what?
2. Is there anyone whose buy-in is needed? → How to get it?
3. Is there anyone who might oppose this? → What are their concerns?
4. Is there a way to make progress visible? → What to track and share?

### Step 8: META ANALYSIS
Check the analysis itself:

1. Are there questions I should be asking that I'm not?
2. Am I assuming something I should be testing?
3. Is my confidence calibrated? (Am I too sure or not sure enough?)
4. What would change my mind about this goal?
5. → INVOKE: /cpra (comprehensive aspects) to check for blind spots

### Step 9: Report
```
UNIVERSAL GOAL ANALYSIS v4:
Goal: [stated goal]
Real goal: [if different from stated]

Situation: [current state summary]
Gap: [what needs to change]

Leverage points:
1. [highest-leverage requirement]
2. [second-highest]

Recommended strategy: [approach and mechanism]
Key assumption: [what must be true]

Priority actions:
1. [first action] — impact: [H/M/L]
2. [second action]
3. [third action]

Top risks:
1. [risk] — likelihood: [1-5] — severity: [1-5] — mitigation: [action]

Communication: [who needs to know what]

Confidence: [overall confidence in this analysis]
Biggest unknown: [what would most change this analysis if known]
```

## When to Use
- Any new goal
- Any goal that feels stuck
- Any goal where approach is uncertain
- Periodic review of ongoing goals
- → See also: /ugav2, /ugav3, /ugav5 for other versions
- → INVOKE: /gu (goal understanding) for goal clarification
- → INVOKE: /gd (goal decomposition) for breaking down complex goals

## Verification
- [ ] Goal is specific and measurable
- [ ] "Is there" asked before "what is" (no assumptions about problems existing)
- [ ] Leverage analysis performed with recursive requirement tracing
- [ ] Multiple strategies considered (not just the obvious one)
- [ ] Actions compared on multiple dimensions
- [ ] Risks include risk of success and risk of inaction
- [ ] Communication needs identified
- [ ] Meta-analysis performed (checking the analysis itself)
