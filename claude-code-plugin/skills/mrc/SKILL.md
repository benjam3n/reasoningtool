## The Three Questions

All metacognition reduces to three questions. Ask them in order. Loop when stuck.

### 1. What am I actually trying to achieve?

Trace backward from the immediate request to the foundational goal.

- What was asked? (surface)
- What does that serve? (one level up)
- What does THAT serve? (keep going until you hit something fundamental)
- Is the surface request the best way to serve the foundational goal?

**Common failure**: Executing the request without checking if it serves the real goal. Someone asks "help me write a resignation letter" — but the goal might be "improve my work situation," which has other solutions.

**Output**: A clear statement of the foundational goal, and whether the current request is the best path to it.

### 2. Is this the best method?

Before executing any approach, check:

- What other methods could achieve this goal?
- What would an expert in a different field suggest?
- Am I using this method because it's best, or because it's familiar?
- What's the strongest argument AGAINST this approach?

**Common failure**: Accepting the first method that seems workable without generating alternatives. Method lock-in.

**Output**: Either confidence that this is the right method (with reasoning), or a better alternative.

### 3. Am I making progress?

During execution, check:

- Is the output getting closer to the goal?
- Am I learning anything surprising? (If no surprises, I might be confirming instead of exploring)
- Am I going through motions or generating insight? (Enumeration vs derivation)
- Should I continue, adjust, or stop?

**Common failure**: Continuing because the procedure says to, not because progress is happening. Sunk cost.

**Output**: A decision — continue (making progress), adjust (on track but method needs tweaking), pivot (wrong track), or stop (goal achieved or unachievable).

## When to Ask Each Question

| Moment | Question | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Starting a new task | Q1: What am I achieving? | Don't execute before understanding |
| Choosing an approach | Q2: Is this the best method? | Don't commit without alternatives |
| Mid-execution, any doubt | Q3: Am I making progress? | Don't continue on faith |
| Getting a surprising result | Q1: Does this change the goal? | Surprises can redefine the problem |
| Feeling stuck | Q2: Is there a better method? | Stuckness usually means wrong method |
| Feeling productive but uncertain | Q3: Is this real progress or busywork? | Activity ≠ progress |

## Integration with Other Skills

Meta-reasoning is not a skill you "run" — it's a lens you apply while running other skills.

- During `/araw`: Q3 — "Am I exploring or enumerating?"
- During `/uaua`: Q1 — "Is this the right question to universalize?"
- During `/gen`: Q2 — "Is generation the right step, or do I need to understand first?"
- During `/cri`: Q3 — "Is this critique actionable or just commentary?"

## Failure Indicators

You've failed at metacognition if:
- Jumped to execution without asking Q1
- Accepted the first method without asking Q2
- Continued past the point of usefulness without asking Q3
- Produced output that's formally correct but doesn't serve the goal
- Never encountered a surprise (suggests confirmation bias)
