# Component Selection

## Overview
A structured procedure for evaluating multiple component options against
requirements, scoring them objectively, and selecting the best fit.
Produces documented rationale for the selection.

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
Collect all requirements that constrain selection

### Step 2: Identify Options
Find candidate components that might meet requirements

### Step 3: Define Evaluation Criteria
Create weighted scoring criteria

### Step 4: Score Each Option
Rate each option against all criteria

### Step 5: Analyze Results
Review scores and identify best option

### Step 6: Document Selection
Record final choice with rationale


## When to Use
- Selecting hardware components for a project (microcontrollers, sensors, motors)
- Choosing software libraries or frameworks for a system
- Evaluating vendor options for procurement decisions
- Selecting materials for manufacturing or construction
- Comparing cloud services or infrastructure options
- Making build-vs-buy decisions for system components
- Upgrading or replacing existing components in a system

## Verification
- All functional requirements are captured before evaluation begins
- At least 3 candidate options were considered
- Criteria weights sum to 100 and reflect actual priorities
- Each option is scored against all criteria with documented reasoning
- Selected component meets all must-have requirements
- Trade-offs are explicitly acknowledged and accepted
- Fork points are documented for future reference
