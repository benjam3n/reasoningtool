# Failure Journey System

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Most goal journey work focuses on SUCCESS paths. But failure is ALSO a goal people pursue — often unconsciously.

This isn't just "anti-flourishing" in the simple sense (one-time destruction). It's the sophisticated patterns of SUSTAINABLE FAILURE — failing in ways that allow continued failing.

Many stories already map these patterns: tragedies, noir, addiction narratives, self-sabotage arcs, "almost but never quite" stories. A complete goal journey system must include failure journeys.

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Failure Pattern
What type of sustainable failure is at play?

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Sisyphus** | Repeated effort, repeated failure, no learning | Trying the same diet every January |
| **Icarus** | Success → overreach → catastrophe → repeat | Building up then burning down businesses |
| **Tantalus** | Almost reaching the goal, never quite | "Almost" getting promoted, year after year |
| **Penelope** | Building and unbuilding endlessly | Making progress then undoing it |
| **Cassandra** | Seeing the problem clearly, unable to change | Knowing what to do but not doing it |
| **Orpheus** | Succeeding until looking back | Self-sabotage at the moment of success |
| **Ouroboros** | The "solution" recreates the problem | Stress-eating about weight gain |

### Step 2: Map the Failure Loop
Every sustainable failure has a loop structure:

```
FAILURE LOOP:
Trigger: [what initiates the cycle]
    ↓
Response: [the habitual action]
    ↓
Short-term relief: [why it feels good/right in the moment]
    ↓
Long-term cost: [what it actually produces]
    ↓
New trigger: [how the cost creates the next trigger]
    ↓
(repeat)
```

Map the specific loop:
1. Where does the loop start? (The trigger)
2. What is the automatic response?
3. What reward maintains the response? (There's ALWAYS a reward)
4. What is the actual cost?
5. How does the cost feed back to create the next trigger?

### Step 3: Identify the Hidden Payoff
Sustainable failure always serves a function. Ask:

1. What does failing PROTECT you from?
   - Fear of success (expectations, visibility, change)
   - Fear of commitment (if you never fully try, you can't fully fail)
   - Identity protection ("I'm not the type of person who...")

2. What does failing PROVIDE?
   - Sympathy, attention, identity as "struggling"
   - Excuse for not doing harder things
   - Familiar comfort (known pain vs unknown change)

3. What would change if you SUCCEEDED?
   - What would you lose?
   - What new problems would emerge?
   - Who would be affected?

**This is the hardest step.** The hidden payoff is usually invisible to the person experiencing it.

### Step 4: Map the Counter-Journey
For each failure pattern, there's a counter-move:

| Pattern | Counter | Mechanism |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Sisyphus | Change the approach, not the effort | Break the assumption that more effort = success |
| Icarus | Set and enforce limits BEFORE success | Constraints at the peak, not at the bottom |
| Tantalus | Investigate the "almost" — is the goal real? | May need to redefine what you actually want |
| Penelope | Burn the boats — make un-doing harder | Remove the option to retreat |
| Cassandra | Get external accountability | Someone else enforces what you can see but won't do |
| Orpheus | Define success BEFORE achieving it | Know what "done" looks like so you don't self-sabotage |
| Ouroboros | Break the loop at the TRIGGER, not the response | Eliminate what starts the cycle |

### Step 5: Design Intervention Points
For the specific failure loop identified:

1. **Prevent the trigger**: Can the trigger be eliminated or reduced?
2. **Interrupt the response**: Can a different response be substituted?
3. **Replace the reward**: Can the hidden payoff be obtained differently?
4. **Reduce the cost**: Can the damage be limited while working on the root cause?
5. **Break the feedback**: Can the cost be prevented from creating the next trigger?

Best intervention: the one that's smallest but breaks the loop permanently.

### Step 6: Report
```
FAILURE JOURNEY ANALYSIS:
Pattern: [which archetype]
Loop: [trigger] → [response] → [relief] → [cost] → [trigger]

Hidden payoff: [what failing provides/protects]
What success would require giving up: [the real cost of change]

Counter-journey:
Intervention point: [where to break the loop]
Specific action: [what to do differently]
Support needed: [what help is required]

Warning: [what will try to pull you back into the pattern]
```

## When to Use
- When the same failure keeps repeating
- When someone "can't" achieve a goal despite adequate resources
- When success is followed by self-sabotage
- When analyzing narrative patterns (fiction or real)
- → INVOKE: /rca (root cause analysis) for deeper causal analysis
- → INVOKE: /hf (habit formation) for building counter-patterns

## Verification
- [ ] Failure pattern correctly identified (not just "things went wrong")
- [ ] Loop mapped with all components (trigger, response, relief, cost, feedback)
- [ ] Hidden payoff identified honestly (the uncomfortable truth)
- [ ] Counter-journey addresses root cause (not just symptom)
- [ ] Intervention point is specific and actionable
