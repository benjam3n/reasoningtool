# Leverage Points

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Not all interventions are equal. In any complex system, there are places where a small shift produces big changes, and places where huge effort produces minimal effect. This procedure identifies where to focus energy for maximum systemic impact.

Key insight: The most powerful leverage points are often counterintuitive, and people frequently push them in the wrong direction.

## Steps

### Step 1: Map the System
1. What is the system you're trying to influence?
2. What are the key variables?
3. How do they connect? (What affects what?)
4. What are the feedback loops? (Reinforcing and balancing)
5. What are the delays? (Where does cause take time to produce effect?)

### Step 2: Identify Leverage Points (Meadows Hierarchy)
Donella Meadows ranked leverage points from weakest to strongest:

**12. Constants, parameters, numbers** (WEAKEST)
- Adjusting quantities (budgets, staffing levels, quotas)
- Example: Changing the thermostat setting
- Easy to adjust but rarely changes system behavior

**11. Buffer sizes**
- The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to flows
- Example: Inventory levels, cash reserves
- Bigger buffers = more stability but more sluggishness

**10. Stock-and-flow structures**
- Physical infrastructure that determines how the system works
- Example: Road network, organizational hierarchy
- Hard to change but significant when changed

**9. Delays**
- Time lags in feedback loops
- Example: How long it takes to see results of a policy change
- Changing delays can stabilize or destabilize systems

**8. Balancing feedback loops**
- Strength of negative feedbacks relative to impacts they correct
- Example: Regulation, quality control, error correction
- Strong balancing loops keep systems stable

**7. Reinforcing feedback loops**
- Strength of positive feedbacks (vicious/virtuous cycles)
- Example: Word of mouth, compound interest, arms races
- The driver of growth AND collapse

**6. Information flows**
- Who has access to what information
- Example: Making pollution data public
- New information flows can change behavior dramatically

**5. Rules**
- Incentives, punishments, constraints
- Example: Laws, contracts, game rules
- Rules define the game; changing rules changes everything

**4. Self-organization**
- Power to add, change, or evolve system structure
- Example: Freedom to start new companies, create new roles
- Allows the system to create its own leverage points

**3. Goals**
- Purpose or function of the system
- Example: Shifting from "maximize profit" to "maximize value"
- Changes what the whole system optimizes for

**2. Paradigms**
- Shared mindsets/assumptions from which the system arises
- Example: "Growth is always good" → "Sustainable is better"
- Changing paradigms changes everything downstream

**1. Transcending paradigms** (STRONGEST)
- The ability to change paradigms, not just the current one
- Recognizing that all paradigms are models, not reality
- Ultimate flexibility

### Step 3: Find YOUR Leverage Points
For the input's system, work through each level:

| Level | Leverage Point | Current State | Possible Intervention | Impact |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| 12 | [parameters] | [now] | [change] | [effect] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Focus on levels 3-7 — these are where most accessible high-leverage interventions live.

### Step 4: Evaluate Interventions

For each identified leverage point:
1. **Accessibility**: Can you actually intervene here? (H/M/L)
2. **Impact**: How much change would this produce? (H/M/L)
3. **Direction**: Are you pushing the right way? (Counterintuitive check)
4. **Reversibility**: Can you undo this if it goes wrong? (H/M/L)
5. **Side effects**: What else changes when you push here?

**Counterintuitive direction check:**
- People often push leverage points in the WRONG direction
- Example: Making information flow LESS (when more would help)
- Example: Strengthening reinforcing loops (when they should be dampened)
- For each intervention: what's the opposite direction? Could THAT be right?

### Step 5: Prioritize
Plot interventions on: Accessibility × Impact

| | High Impact | Low Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **High Access** | DO THESE FIRST | Low priority |
| **Low Access** | Invest to gain access | Ignore |

### Step 6: Report
```
LEVERAGE POINT ANALYSIS:
System: [what system]
Goal: [what you're trying to change]

Leverage points identified:
| # | Level | Point | Intervention | Access | Impact |
|---|-------|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [level] | [what] | [do what] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] |

Top recommendation: [highest accessible impact]
Direction check: [confirmed / counterintuitive reversal needed]
Side effects: [what else changes]
Warning: [common mistakes at this leverage level]
```

## When to Use
- Choosing where to intervene in a system
- Prioritizing effort allocation
- Understanding why some changes work and others don't
- Designing systemic interventions
- → INVOKE: /sya (systems analysis) for system mapping
- → INVOKE: /sym (system dynamics) for modeling interactions

## Verification
- [ ] System mapped (variables, connections, feedbacks)
- [ ] Multiple leverage levels considered (not just parameters)
- [ ] Counterintuitive direction checked
- [ ] Accessibility and impact assessed
- [ ] Side effects identified
- [ ] Highest-leverage accessible intervention recommended
