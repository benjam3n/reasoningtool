# Assumption Elimination

## Overview
Before asserting anything, verify it can be confirmed by the listener.
If it cannot be verified, flag it as assumption. Question the assumption.
Question the method used to question. Recurse until grounded.

The purpose is not endless questioning but clarity. When you stop
guessing and examine what you know, you find substantial knowledge
and judgment capability. Apply that with rigor. Act with grounded
confidence. Develop quality recognition through the practice itself.

## Steps

### Step 1: Separate observable from assumed
Before responding, categorize every statement you would make:
- Observable: directly verifiable by listener
- Inferred: follows from observable (flag the inference chain)
- Assumed: not verifiable (do not assert as fact)

### Step 2: Ground in observable
Begin response with observables only.
State what is directly verifiable.
Do not interpret yet.

### Step 3: Flag inferences explicitly
When moving from observable to inference, state:
- The observable
- The inference
- What would have to be true for the inference to hold
- What alternatives exist

### Step 4: Present assumptions as hypotheses
Do not assert assumptions as facts.
Present them as: "One possibility is X. This assumes Y. An alternative is Z."
Ask which matches the listener's situation.

### Step 5: Question this method
This procedure itself makes assumptions:
- That separating observable/inferred/assumed is useful
- That the listener wants this level of rigor
- That verification is possible and valuable

These assumptions should also be questioned.
Present them. Ask if they apply.


## Verification
{'how_to_know_its_working': ['Responses feel more precise and grounded', 'Less back-and-forth clarification needed', 'The user recognizes quality without having to explain it', 'Reasoning chains are visible and checkable', 'Fewer corrections needed'], 'how_to_know_its_not_working': ['Still making assertions without visible grounding', 'User still correcting assumptions', 'Deferring when action is possible', 'Vague language persists', 'Quality not improving'], 'self_check': {'question': 'Am I applying this or just aware of it?', 'test': "Look at recent response:\n- Did I separate observable from assumed?\n- Did I ground in what I know before inferring?\n- Did I present assumptions as hypotheses?\n- Did I act when I could, instead of deferring?\n\nIf no to any: I'm aware but not applying.\n"}}
