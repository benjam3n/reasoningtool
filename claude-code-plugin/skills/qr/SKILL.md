# Qualitative Research

## Overview
Systematic procedure for qualitative data analysis including coding, thematic analysis, grounded theory, and interview techniques

## Steps

### Step 1: Design the qualitative study
Plan the overall approach to the qualitative inquiry:

1. CLARIFY THE RESEARCH QUESTION

   Good qualitative questions:
   - Ask "how" or "what" (not "how many" or "does X cause Y")
   - Are open and exploratory
   - Focus on meaning, experience, or process
   - Cannot be answered with yes/no

   Examples:
   - "How do first-generation students experience college transition?"
   - "What factors shape decision-making in X context?"
   - "How do participants make sense of their experiences with Y?"

2. SELECT THEORETICAL ORIENTATION

   Phenomenology:
   - Focus: Lived experience of a phenomenon
   - Goal: Describe essence of the experience
   - Questions: "What is it like to experience X?"
   - Analysis: Identify essential structures of experience

   Grounded Theory:
   - Focus: Process or action
   - Goal: Develop theory from data
   - Questions: "What process explains X?"
   - Analysis: Build theory through constant comparison

   Ethnography:
   - Focus: Culture-sharing group
   - Goal: Describe and interpret cultural patterns
   - Questions: "How does this group operate?"
   - Analysis: Identify cultural themes and patterns

   Case Study:
   - Focus: Bounded case or cases
   - Goal: In-depth understanding of case
   - Questions: "What can we learn from this case?"
   - Analysis: Within-case and cross-case analysis

   Narrative:
   - Focus: Stories and life experiences
   - Goal: Understand through storytelling
   - Questions: "What story do participants tell about X?"
   - Analysis: Restorying, structural analysis

3. DETERMINE SAMPLING STRATEGY

   Purposive sampling approaches:
   - Maximum variation: Diverse cases for range of experience
   - Homogeneous: Similar cases for depth
   - Critical case: Cases that are especially informative
   - Theory-driven: Cases to develop/test emerging theory
   - Snowball: Participants refer others

   Sample size:
   - Aim for saturation (no new themes emerging)
   - Typical ranges: 5-25 for phenomenology, 20-30 for grounded theory
   - Quality of data matters more than quantity

4. PLAN DATA COLLECTION

   Data types:
   - Individual interviews
   - Focus groups
   - Observation/field notes
   - Documents and artifacts
   - Visual methods

   Consider triangulation: Multiple data sources for robustness

### Step 2: Develop interview and data collection protocols
Create guides for systematic data collection:

INTERVIEW GUIDE DEVELOPMENT:

1. Structure
   - Introduction (5-10 min)
     * Rapport building
     * Study explanation
     * Consent process
     * Recording permission

   - Opening questions (5-10 min)
     * Easy, non-threatening
     * Get participant talking
     * Example: "Tell me about your background with X"

   - Main questions (30-45 min)
     * Core topics of inquiry
     * Open-ended, non-leading
     * Ordered from general to specific
     * Include probes for each question

   - Closing (5-10 min)
     * Wrap-up questions
     * "Is there anything else?"
     * Thank participant
     * Explain next steps

2. Question Types

   Descriptive questions:
   - "Tell me about..."
   - "Describe your experience with..."
   - "Walk me through..."

   Structural questions:
   - "How would you categorize...?"
   - "What types of X are there?"
   - "How do you organize your thinking about...?"

   Contrast questions:
   - "How does X compare to Y?"
   - "What's the difference between...?"

   Evaluation questions:
   - "What do you think about...?"
   - "How do you feel when...?"

3. Probes

   Elaboration: "Tell me more about that"
   Clarification: "What do you mean by...?"
   Example: "Can you give me an example?"
   Consequence: "What happened then?"
   Comparison: "How does that compare to...?"
   Silence: (pause and wait)

FOCUS GROUP GUIDE:

1. Opening activity
   - Icebreaker
   - Ground rules
   - Introductions

2. Main discussion
   - Opening question (everyone answers)
   - Key questions (5-6 main topics)
   - Activities if appropriate

3. Closing
   - Summary and member check
   - Final thoughts
   - Thank participants

Moderator skills:
- Balance participation
- Handle dominant/quiet participants
- Manage disagreements
- Keep on track without stifling

OBSERVATION PROTOCOL:

What to observe:
- Physical setting
- Participants and roles
- Activities and interactions
- Conversations
- Subtle factors (tone, body language)
- Your own reactions

Field note format:
- Descriptive notes (what happened)
- Reflective notes (your thoughts)
- Date, time, location
- Write up fully immediately after

### Step 3: Conduct data collection
Execute systematic data gathering:

INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES:

1. Rapport building
   - Be warm, genuine, interested
   - Small talk before recording
   - Explain process clearly
   - Acknowledge their expertise on their experience

2. Active listening
   - Full attention on participant
   - Minimal interruption
   - Nod, "mm-hmm" to encourage
   - Reflect back what you hear

3. Following up
   - Use probes to go deeper
   - Follow interesting threads
   - Don't rush to next question
   - Tolerate silence (they may be thinking)

4. Managing challenges

   Talkative participant:
   - "That's helpful. Let me make sure we cover..."
   - Redirect gently

   Quiet participant:
   - More encouragement
   - Longer pauses
   - Easier questions first

   Emotional content:
   - Acknowledge feelings
   - Offer to pause
   - Have resources available if needed

   Off-topic:
   - "That's interesting. To get back to..."
   - Gently redirect

RECORDING AND DOCUMENTATION:

Audio recording:
- Get explicit consent
- Test equipment before
- Use backup recorder
- Note any issues

During interview:
- Brief notes (keywords, follow-ups)
- Non-verbal observations
- Your own reactions

Immediately after:
- Write reflective memo
- Note initial impressions
- Document context
- Ideas for follow-up

TRANSCRIPTION:

Verbatim transcription:
- Every word spoken
- Include filler words (um, uh)
- Note pauses, laughter, emotion
- Time stamps helpful

Transcription conventions:
- [pause] for silences
- [laughs] for non-verbal
- ... for trailing off
- CAPS for emphasis
- (inaudible) when unclear

Quality check:
- Listen while reading transcript
- Correct errors
- Verify participant identification

ITERATIVE DATA COLLECTION:

In grounded theory especially:
- Analyze as you collect
- Let early analysis shape later questions
- Theoretical sampling: seek specific cases
- Continue until saturation

### Step 4: Code the data
Systematically code data to identify patterns:

CODING FUNDAMENTALS:

What is a code?
- A label for a segment of data
- Captures the meaning of that segment
- Building block for themes

Types of codes:

Descriptive codes:
- Summarize topic of passage
- What is this about?
- Example: "family support"

In vivo codes:
- Participant's own words
- Preserve authentic voice
- Example: "just surviving"

Process codes:
- Actions and processes
- Use gerunds (-ing)
- Example: "negotiating identity"

Emotion codes:
- Feelings expressed or inferred
- Example: "frustrated"

Values codes:
- Beliefs and values
- Example: "valuing independence"

FIRST CYCLE CODING:

1. Read through data first
   - Get overall sense
   - Note initial impressions
   - Don't code yet

2. Line-by-line coding
   - Code every segment
   - Stay close to data
   - Don't interpret too much yet
   - Generate many codes

3. Code the same data multiple ways
   - Different codes capture different aspects
   - Layer codes (descriptive + process + emotion)

4. Write memos as you code
   - Why this code?
   - What does it mean?
   - How does it connect to other codes?

SECOND CYCLE CODING:

Pattern coding:
- Group related codes into categories
- Look for patterns across codes
- Reduce many codes to fewer categories

Focused coding:
- Use most frequent/significant codes
- Apply systematically across data
- Test codes against new data

Axial coding (grounded theory):
- Identify relationships between categories
- Conditions, actions, consequences
- Build toward theory

Theoretical coding (grounded theory):
- Integrate categories around core category
- Develop theoretical framework

CODING MECHANICS:

Tools:
- Qualitative software (NVivo, Atlas.ti, Dedoose)
- Word processor with comments
- Spreadsheets
- Physical (printed transcripts, highlighters)

Codebook:
- Code name
- Definition
- When to use/not use
- Example quotes

Track decisions:
- Why codes were merged/split
- How definitions evolved
- Audit trail

### Step 5: Develop themes
Move from codes to themes through thematic analysis:

THEMATIC ANALYSIS PROCESS:

1. Familiarization
   - Immerse yourself in data
   - Read and re-read
   - Note initial patterns

2. Generating initial codes
   - Systematic coding (Step 4)
   - Note potential themes

3. Searching for themes
   - Examine codes for patterns
   - Group codes into potential themes
   - Create theme-piles

4. Reviewing themes
   - Check themes against coded data
   - Check themes against full dataset
   - Refine, split, combine as needed
   - Two levels:
     * Do codes form coherent theme?
     * Does theme work across dataset?

5. Defining and naming themes
   - Clear definition of each theme
   - Capture essence in name
   - Identify subthemes if needed
   - Write theme descriptions

6. Writing up
   - Analytic narrative
   - Evidence (quotes) for each theme
   - How themes relate to research question

THEME CHARACTERISTICS:

Good themes:
- Capture something important about the data
- Relate to research question
- Are not just a code (more abstract)
- Have internal coherence
- Are distinct from other themes

Theme types:
- Semantic: Surface-level, descriptive
- Latent: Underlying meanings, interpretive

THEME DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES:

Pattern identification:
- What comes up repeatedly?
- What do participants emphasize?
- What surprises you?

Constant comparison:
- Compare within interview
- Compare across interviews
- Compare to emerging themes

Negative case analysis:
- Look for disconfirming evidence
- Cases that don't fit pattern
- Refine themes to account for variation

CONSTRUCTING THE THEMATIC MAP:

Organize themes:
- Main themes (3-6 typical)
- Subthemes under main themes
- Relationships between themes

Visual representation:
- Thematic map diagram
- Shows structure of analysis
- Helps identify gaps

Test the structure:
- Does it answer research question?
- Is it supported by data?
- Does it make sense to others?

### Step 6: Apply grounded theory methods (if applicable)
Use grounded theory for theory development:

GROUNDED THEORY BASICS:

Goal: Develop theory that is "grounded" in data
Process: Simultaneous data collection and analysis
Output: Theoretical framework explaining phenomenon

KEY PROCEDURES:

1. Open coding
   - Initial line-by-line coding
   - Generate many codes
   - Ask: What is happening here?
   - Stay close to data

2. Axial coding
   - Relate categories to subcategories
   - Identify relationships
   - Use coding paradigm:
     * Conditions: What leads to phenomenon?
     * Actions/Interactions: How do people respond?
     * Consequences: What results?

3. Selective coding
   - Identify core category
   - Central phenomenon around which theory revolves
   - Relate all categories to core
   - Fill in gaps

CONSTANT COMPARISON:

Compare:
- Data to data (within and across cases)
- Data to codes
- Codes to codes
- Codes to categories
- Categories to categories

Purpose:
- Develop properties of categories
- Ensure consistency
- Identify variation

THEORETICAL SAMPLING:

What it is:
- Sampling driven by emerging theory
- Seek data to develop/test categories
- Not representative sampling

Process:
- Initial sampling: Start broadly
- As categories emerge: Sample to develop them
- Late stage: Sample to saturate and test

Examples:
- Category needs more properties? Find cases that vary on dimension
- Category seems complete? Find negative cases
- Relationship unclear? Sample cases at boundaries

THEORETICAL SATURATION:

Saturation means:
- No new properties emerging
- No new dimensions emerging
- Relationships are well established

Evidence of saturation:
- New data fits existing categories
- Categories are well-developed
- Relationships are clear

MEMO WRITING:

Memos are crucial in grounded theory:
- Write continuously throughout
- Explore ideas about codes and categories
- Develop properties and dimensions
- Explore relationships

Types:
- Code memos: About specific codes
- Theoretical memos: Developing theory
- Operational memos: Methods decisions

DEVELOPING THE THEORY:

Theory elements:
- Core category (central phenomenon)
- Main categories and their properties
- Relationships between categories
- Conditions under which relationships hold

Theory format:
- Visual diagram
- Propositional statements
- Narrative description

### Step 7: Ensure trustworthiness
Demonstrate quality and rigor:

TRUSTWORTHINESS CRITERIA:

1. Credibility (internal validity equivalent)
   - Are findings believable?
   - Do they ring true?

   Strategies:
   - Prolonged engagement: Sufficient time with data
   - Triangulation: Multiple sources, methods, researchers
   - Member checking: Participants review findings
   - Peer debriefing: Colleagues review analysis
   - Negative case analysis: Address contradictions

2. Transferability (external validity equivalent)
   - Can findings apply elsewhere?
   - Not generalization, but informed transfer

   Strategies:
   - Thick description: Rich detail about context
   - Clear sampling: Who was studied
   - Comparison to other contexts: Where might this apply?

3. Dependability (reliability equivalent)
   - Would process produce similar results?
   - Is process consistent and documented?

   Strategies:
   - Audit trail: Document all decisions
   - Code-recode reliability: Re-code sample, check consistency
   - External audit: Outside review of process

4. Confirmability (objectivity equivalent)
   - Are findings shaped by participants, not researcher bias?
   - Is researcher influence acknowledged?

   Strategies:
   - Reflexivity: Acknowledge researcher position
   - Audit trail: Evidence linking data to findings
   - Multiple coders: Check for agreement

SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES:

Member checking:
- Share findings with participants
- Do they recognize their experience?
- Note any disagreements
- Not requiring agreement, but checking resonance

Peer debriefing:
- Colleague reviews your analysis
- Challenges assumptions
- Asks hard questions
- Catches blind spots

Triangulation types:
- Data triangulation: Multiple sources
- Investigator triangulation: Multiple researchers
- Theory triangulation: Multiple perspectives
- Method triangulation: Multiple methods

Audit trail contents:
- Raw data
- Data reduction products (codes, themes)
- Process notes (how decisions were made)
- Materials about researcher position
- Preliminary findings to final report

REFLEXIVITY:

What to reflect on:
- Your background and how it shapes interpretation
- Your relationship to topic and participants
- Assumptions you bring
- How your presence affected data

Document in:
- Reflexive journal
- Methods section
- Analysis discussion

### Step 8: Write findings and report
Present findings in compelling narrative form:

WRITING QUALITATIVE FINDINGS:

1. Organize by themes
   - Each theme is a section
   - Define and explain theme
   - Provide evidence (quotes)
   - Interpret meaning

2. Use participant quotes effectively

   Good quote use:
   - Illustrates the theme
   - Shows participant voice
   - Integrated into narrative
   - Not too long (2-4 sentences ideal)

   Quote presentation:
   - Introduce: Set up the quote
   - Present: The quote itself
   - Interpret: What it means

   Example:
   "Participants described feeling caught between worlds.
   As Maria explained, 'I don't fully belong in either place.
   At home I'm too American, at school I'm too Mexican.'
   This experience of cultural liminality shaped..."

3. Balance description and interpretation
   - Describe what participants said/did
   - Interpret what it means
   - Connect to research question
   - Connect to theory/literature

4. Show complexity
   - Present main pattern
   - Also show variations
   - Address contradictions
   - Avoid oversimplification

REPORT STRUCTURE (typical):

Introduction:
- Research question
- Why it matters
- What we don't know

Methods:
- Approach and rationale
- Participants and sampling
- Data collection procedures
- Analysis approach
- Trustworthiness strategies

Findings:
- Organized by theme
- Rich quotes
- Interpretation

Discussion:
- Relation to research question
- Relation to literature
- Implications
- Limitations
- Future directions

WRITING QUALITY:

Voice:
- First person is acceptable
- Let participants' voices come through
- Write accessibly

Balance:
- Enough quotes to support claims
- Not so many it's just quotes
- Your analysis is the contribution

Persuasion:
- Evidence for each claim
- Acknowledge limitations
- Show rigor through transparency
