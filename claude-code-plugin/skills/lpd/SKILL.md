# Leverage Point Discovery (Arbitrage & System Insertion)

## Overview
Most valuable strategies exploit leverage points - places where small
effort produces disproportionate results. This procedure searches for
multiple types of leverage:

PRIMARY TYPES (position-based):
1. ARBITRAGE: Position yourself between disconnected systems/markets
   that have inefficient information/price/value flow.
   Example: Dropshipping (supplier market ↔ you ↔ retail market)

2. SYSTEM INSERTION: Insert yourself into an existing system's flow
   where there's friction, complexity, or unmet needs.
   Example: Payment processors (buyer → you → seller)

ADDITIONAL TYPES (extensible):
- Network effects, compounding, automation, aggregation
- Scarcity, standards, trust/reputation, data/learning, optionality

All leverage types find where value is trapped, flowing inefficiently,
or could be amplified with the right positioning.

## Goal
Find high-leverage opportunities by identifying gaps between systems
(arbitrage) or friction points within systems (insertion opportunities).
Systematic search across leverage types reduces intelligence needed.

## Steps

### Step 1: Map the Landscape
Identify all the systems, markets, and flows in the domain.

Ask:
- What are the major systems/markets?
- Who are the players (buyers, sellers, intermediaries)?
- What flows between them (money, goods, information, attention)?
- Where are the boundaries between systems?

**Output**: System/market map

### Step 2: Search for Arbitrage Opportunities
Look for gaps BETWEEN systems where value/information flows
inefficiently or not at all.

For each pair of systems, ask:
- Is there a price difference? (buy low, sell high)
- Is there an information asymmetry? (know something one side doesn't)
- Is there a timing gap? (faster than the market corrects)
- Is there a geographic gap? (available here, needed there)
- Is there an access gap? (you can reach both, they can't reach each other)
- Is there a format gap? (incompatible systems you could bridge)

**Output**: Arbitrage opportunities

### Step 3: Search for Insertion Opportunities
Look for friction points WITHIN existing flows where you could
insert yourself to add value.

For each flow, ask:
- Where is it slow? (you could speed it up)
- Where is it complex? (you could simplify it)
- Where is it unreliable? (you could make it reliable)
- Where is it expensive? (you could make it cheaper)
- Where is it opaque? (you could make it transparent)
- Where is trust lacking? (you could provide trust/verification)
- Where do systems not talk? (you could translate/integrate)
- Where do people struggle? (you could provide an easier interface)

**Output**: Insertion opportunities

### Step 4: Search Other Leverage Types
Go through additional leverage types and ask whether any apply.

For each type, consider:
- Network effects: What gets more valuable with more users?
- Compounding: What builds on itself over time?
- Automation: What manual work could be systematized?
- Aggregation: What fragmented things could be combined?
- Scarcity: What limited resources could you control?
- Standards: What coordination problems need solving?
- Trust: Where is credibility hard to establish?
- Data: What learning loops could you create?
- Optionality: What positions preserve future choices?

**Output**: Additional leverage opportunities

### Step 5: Evaluate Each Opportunity
For each opportunity found, assess:

LEVERAGE FACTORS:
- Value gap: How much value is currently lost/trapped?
- Defensibility: Can others easily copy you?
- Scalability: Can this grow without proportional effort?
- Sustainability: Will this opportunity persist?

FEASIBILITY FACTORS:
- Access: Can you actually get into position?
- Resources: Do you have what's needed?
- Risk: What could go wrong?
- Competition: Who else is trying this?

**Output**: Evaluated opportunities

### Step 6: Rank and Select
Rank all opportunities by:
1. Leverage potential (value × defensibility × scalability)
2. Feasibility (access × resources × low risk)
3. Fit with your resources/skills

Select top candidates for deeper analysis.

**Output**: Ranked opportunities with top selections


## When to Use
- Looking for business/strategy opportunities
- Want high-leverage approaches (small input, large output)
- Searching for competitive advantages
- Exploring new markets or niches
- Want to avoid competing on pure effort/resources

## Verification
- Systems and flows were mapped before searching
- Both arbitrage AND insertion types were searched
- Opportunities were evaluated on leverage AND feasibility
- Selected opportunities match available resources
- Sustainability of opportunity was considered
