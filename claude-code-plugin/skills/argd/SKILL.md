# Argumentative Document

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Build a rigorous argumentative document. Starts from a thesis, constructs supporting arguments with evidence, addresses counterarguments honestly, and produces a document where every claim is supported and every objection is handled.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Thesis
1. State as a single, clear, falsifiable claim
2. Distinguish from: topic (too broad), question (not a position), opinion (not argued)
3. Test: can someone disagree? If not, it's not a thesis.
4. Scope: what does this cover and NOT cover?
5. Stakes: why does this matter?

### Step 2: Identify the Audience
1. Who is this for?
2. What do they currently believe?
3. What would convince them?
4. What are their likely objections?
5. What shared premises can you build on?

### Step 3: Map the Argument Structure
1. What are the 3-5 main supporting arguments?
2. For each: state as claim, identify evidence, link to thesis
3. Order: strongest first? Build gradually? Address objections inline?
4. Identify dependencies between arguments

### Step 4: Gather and Assess Evidence
For each argument:
1. What evidence exists? (data, studies, examples, logic)
2. How strong is each piece?
3. Sufficient to support the claim?
4. Could it be interpreted differently?
5. Are you cherry-picking? What evidence goes against you?

### Step 5: Address Counterarguments
1. List every serious counterargument
2. Construct the STRONGEST version of each (steelman)
3. For each: refute, concede, or integrate
   - **Refute**: show why it fails with evidence
   - **Concede**: acknowledge, show it doesn't defeat thesis
   - **Integrate**: show it supports a modified thesis
4. If a counterargument defeats your thesis, update the thesis.

### Step 6: Write the Document
1. **Introduction**: context, thesis, roadmap
2. **Background**: shared premises, definitions, scope
3. **Arguments**: each with evidence
4. **Counterarguments**: honest engagement
5. **Synthesis**: how arguments combine
6. **Conclusion**: restate thesis, implications

Standards: every claim has evidence, uncertainty acknowledged, no rhetorical tricks.

### Step 7: Verify
1. Thesis stated in one sentence and consistent throughout?
2. Every argument supports the thesis (not a related claim)?
3. Every counterargument addressed?
4. Evidence cited accurately?
5. Would an opponent feel fairly represented?

## When to Use
- Writing persuasive essays, proposals, position papers
- Building a case for a decision
- Preparing debate arguments

## Verification
- [ ] Thesis clear, falsifiable, consistent throughout
- [ ] 3+ supporting arguments with evidence
- [ ] Counterarguments steelmanned and addressed
- [ ] No unsupported claims
- [ ] Honest about uncertainty
