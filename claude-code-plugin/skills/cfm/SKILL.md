# Cash Flow Management

## Overview
Track and optimize cash flow including income, expenses, runway calculation, and burn rate analysis

## Steps

### Step 1: Map all income sources
Create comprehensive income inventory:
1. List all sources of income
   - Employment income (salary, wages, bonuses)
   - Self-employment/freelance income
   - Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains)
   - Rental income
   - Other income (side gigs, royalties, etc.)
2. For each source document:
   - Gross and net amounts
   - Frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
   - Payment timing (1st of month, 15th, etc.)
   - Reliability rating (guaranteed, expected, possible)
3. Calculate average monthly income
   - Include only reliable income in base calculation
   - Note variable/bonus income separately
4. Identify income patterns and seasonality

### Step 2: Categorize and track all expenses
Build comprehensive expense picture:
1. Gather expense data
   - Pull bank/credit card statements (3-6 months minimum)
   - Review recurring payments and subscriptions
   - Include cash spending
2. Categorize each expense:
   - Fixed essential (rent, loans, insurance)
   - Variable essential (groceries, utilities, healthcare)
   - Fixed discretionary (subscriptions, memberships)
   - Variable discretionary (dining, entertainment, shopping)
   - Periodic (annual bills, holidays, maintenance)
3. Calculate monthly averages for each category
4. Identify spending patterns and anomalies
5. Note payment timing and due dates

### Step 3: Calculate burn rate
Determine cash consumption rate:
1. Calculate gross burn rate
   - Sum all monthly expenses
   - Include periodic expenses (annual / 12)
   - Include irregular expenses (average over period)
2. Calculate net burn rate
   - Gross burn minus total monthly income
   - Positive = depleting cash
   - Negative = accumulating cash
3. Calculate essential burn rate
   - Fixed essential + variable essential only
   - Your minimum survival number
4. Analyze burn rate trends
   - Is it increasing, decreasing, or stable?
   - What's driving the trend?

### Step 4: Calculate runway
Determine how long cash will last:
1. Calculate current cash position
   - Cash in checking/savings
   - Money market funds
   - Other liquid assets
   - Do NOT include retirement accounts or illiquid assets
2. Calculate standard runway
   - Cash position / Net burn rate
   - If net burn is negative (cash positive), runway is infinite
3. Calculate conservative runway
   - Cash position / Gross burn rate
   - Assumes zero income
4. Calculate emergency runway
   - Cash position / Essential burn rate
   - How long you can survive in crisis mode
5. Determine runway adequacy
   - Compare to target (6-12 months recommended)
   - Identify gap if any

### Step 5: Build cash flow forecast
Project cash position over time:
1. Create month-by-month projection
   - Start with current cash position
   - Add expected income for each month
   - Subtract expected expenses for each month
   - Include known large expenses (taxes, annual bills)
   - Calculate ending cash for each month
2. Identify cash flow gaps
   - Any months where cash goes negative?
   - Any months with dangerously low balances?
3. Create scenarios
   - Best case: higher income, lower expenses
   - Base case: expected income and expenses
   - Worst case: lower income, higher expenses
4. Identify critical thresholds
   - When does cash hit warning level?
   - When does cash hit critical level?

### Step 6: Identify optimization opportunities
Find ways to improve cash flow:
1. Income optimization
   - Can any income be accelerated?
   - Are there untapped income sources?
   - Can payment terms be improved?
   - Is there potential for raises/rate increases?
2. Expense reduction
   - Review discretionary expenses for cuts
   - Identify unused subscriptions
   - Compare rates for services (insurance, utilities)
   - Find alternatives for major expense categories
3. Timing optimization
   - Align expense timing with income timing
   - Negotiate payment dates with creditors
   - Use credit strategically (0% offers, payment float)
4. Structural improvements
   - Consolidate debt to lower payments
   - Refinance loans if rates available
   - Negotiate recurring contracts
5. Prioritize opportunities
   - Impact (how much does it improve cash flow?)
   - Effort (how hard is it to implement?)
   - Speed (how quickly does it help?)

### Step 7: Establish cash flow management system
Set up ongoing monitoring and management:
1. Select tracking method
   - Spreadsheet (manual but flexible)
   - Budgeting app (automated but less control)
   - Accounting software (for business)
2. Set up tracking cadence
   - Daily: quick balance check
   - Weekly: record and categorize transactions
   - Monthly: full review and forecast update
3. Define alert thresholds
   - Warning level: take action soon
   - Critical level: take action immediately
4. Create emergency procedures
   - What to do if cash drops to warning level
   - What to do if cash drops to critical level
5. Schedule regular reviews
   - Monthly: update forecast, review spending
   - Quarterly: review trends, adjust strategy
   - Annually: comprehensive cash flow audit


## When to Use
- Starting a business or going through startup phase
- Living on variable or irregular income
- Experiencing financial stress or uncertainty
- Planning a major life transition (job change, sabbatical, retirement)
- Managing seasonal income fluctuations
- Determining how long savings will last
- Evaluating whether to take a financial risk
- Building towards financial independence
- Running a project with limited funding

## Verification
- All income sources are captured with timing
- All expenses are categorized and totaled
- Burn rate is calculated correctly
- Runway calculation is accurate and realistic
- Forecast includes known future events
- Optimization opportunities are actionable
- Tracking system is set up and being used
