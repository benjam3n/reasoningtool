# SEO Fundamentals

## Overview
Build organic search visibility through keyword research, on-page optimization, content strategy, and link building

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand search fundamentals
Build foundational understanding of how SEO works:

How search engines rank pages:
1. Crawling: Bots discover pages by following links
2. Indexing: Pages are analyzed and stored in database
3. Ranking: Algorithm determines order for each query

Key ranking factors (simplified):
- Relevance: Does page match search intent?
- Quality: Is content comprehensive and accurate?
- Authority: Do other trusted sites link here?
- Experience: Is the page fast, mobile-friendly, accessible?

Search intent types:
- Informational: User wants to learn ("how to cook pasta")
- Navigational: User wants specific site ("facebook login")
- Commercial: User researching purchase ("best laptops 2024")
- Transactional: User ready to buy ("buy macbook pro")

E-E-A-T quality signals:
- Experience: First-hand experience with topic
- Expertise: Knowledge and skill in the area
- Authoritativeness: Recognition as a source
- Trustworthiness: Accuracy and reliability

Understand that Google's goal is to surface the best answer
for every query. Your goal is to BE the best answer.

### Step 2: Conduct keyword research
Identify what your target customers search for:

Seed keyword generation:
- List problems your product solves
- List questions customers ask
- List features and benefits
- List industry terminology
- Use customer language from interviews

Keyword research tools:
- Google Keyword Planner (free with Ads account)
- Ahrefs / SEMrush / Moz (paid, comprehensive)
- Ubersuggest (freemium)
- AnswerThePublic (question-based)
- Google Search (autocomplete, "People also ask")
- Google Trends (trend analysis)

For each keyword, gather:
- Monthly search volume (how many searches)
- Keyword difficulty (how hard to rank)
- Search intent (what users want)
- Current SERP features (ads, snippets, etc.)
- Current top-ranking pages (your competition)

Keyword categorization:
- Head terms: High volume, high competition ("project management")
- Long-tail: Lower volume, lower competition ("best project management for remote teams")
- Question-based: "how to", "what is", "why does"
- Comparison: "X vs Y", "X alternatives"
- Commercial: "best X", "top X", "X reviews"

Build comprehensive list, then prioritize.

### Step 3: Prioritize keyword targets
Choose which keywords to target first:

Prioritization matrix:
- Business relevance: How closely tied to your offering?
- Search volume: How many monthly searches?
- Difficulty: How hard to rank in top 3?
- Intent match: Are searchers your target customer?
- Conversion potential: Will rankings drive business value?

Strategic buckets:

Quick wins (prioritize first):
- Medium volume + low difficulty
- Already ranking 10-30 position
- Long-tail with clear intent

Strategic investments (build toward):
- High volume + high difficulty
- Core to business positioning
- Build authority over time

Foundation content (essential):
- Definitional queries in your space
- Establishes topical authority
- Supports other content through links

Avoid:
- High difficulty without resources to compete
- High volume but irrelevant traffic
- Keywords dominated by major brands/Wikipedia

Create prioritized keyword list with rationale.
Aim for 10-20 priority keywords to start.

### Step 4: Audit technical SEO foundation
Ensure site is crawlable and performant:

Crawlability checks:
- Robots.txt allows search engine access
- XML sitemap exists and is submitted
- No broken links (4xx errors)
- No redirect chains or loops
- Clean URL structure (no duplicate content)

Indexability checks:
- Pages appearing in Google (site:yoursite.com)
- No unintended noindex tags
- Canonical tags set correctly
- Hreflang for international (if applicable)

Performance checks:
- Core Web Vitals passing (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Mobile-friendly design
- HTTPS enabled
- No render-blocking resources

Site structure:
- Logical hierarchy (home > category > page)
- Important pages within 3 clicks of home
- Internal linking connects related content
- Clear navigation

Tools for technical audit:
- Google Search Console (free, essential)
- PageSpeed Insights (free)
- Screaming Frog (crawl analysis)
- GTmetrix (performance)

Fix critical issues before content investment.

### Step 5: Create on-page optimization framework
Define how to optimize individual pages:

On-page SEO checklist:

Title tag:
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Under 60 characters (or gets truncated)
- Compelling for click-through
- Unique per page
- Format: "Primary Keyword - Secondary | Brand"

Meta description:
- Include keyword naturally
- Under 155 characters
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action
- Unique per page

URL structure:
- Include primary keyword
- Short and descriptive
- Use hyphens between words
- Avoid parameters when possible
- Example: /keyword-topic/

Heading structure:
- H1: One per page, includes keyword
- H2: Section headers, related keywords
- H3+: Subsections, questions, details
- Logical hierarchy (no skipping levels)

Content optimization:
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Related keywords throughout (naturally)
- Comprehensive coverage of topic
- Answer user questions directly
- Use lists, tables, images for readability
- Include internal links to related content
- Include external links to authoritative sources

Image optimization:
- Descriptive file names
- Alt text with context
- Compressed file sizes
- Appropriate dimensions

Schema markup:
- Article schema for blog posts
- Product schema for products
- FAQ schema for question content
- Organization schema for homepage

### Step 6: Develop content strategy for keywords
Plan content to target priority keywords:

Content-keyword mapping:
- One primary keyword per page
- Related/secondary keywords per page
- No keyword cannibalization (competing with yourself)

Content types by intent:

Informational content:
- How-to guides and tutorials
- Explainer articles ("what is X")
- Industry insights and analysis
- Ultimate guides (comprehensive resources)

Commercial content:
- Comparison posts ("X vs Y")
- Best-of lists ("best tools for X")
- Review content
- Use case articles

Transactional content:
- Product pages
- Service pages
- Landing pages
- Pricing pages

Content quality requirements:
- Better than existing top 3 results
- More comprehensive coverage
- More recent information
- Better formatting and readability
- Unique insights or data
- Proper E-E-A-T signals

Content production plan:
- Prioritize quick-win keywords first
- Set sustainable publishing cadence
- Plan content clusters (pillar + supporting)
- Schedule updates for existing content

### Step 7: Build link earning strategy
Plan how to earn quality backlinks:

Why links matter:
- Links are votes of confidence from other sites
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Relevant sites in your industry carry more weight
- Natural link profiles look diverse

Link-worthy content types:
- Original research and data
- Industry surveys and reports
- Comprehensive guides (link-as-resource)
- Free tools and calculators
- Infographics and visual assets
- Expert roundups and quotes

Ethical link building tactics:

Content-based:
- Create something so good people link naturally
- Guest posting on relevant sites (value exchange)
- Expert contribution to industry publications
- HARO (Help A Reporter Out) responses
- Podcast appearances with show notes links

Relationship-based:
- Build relationships with industry influencers
- Participate in communities (add value, not links)
- Collaborate on research or content
- Sponsor relevant events or causes

Digital PR:
- Create newsworthy announcements
- Newsjacking (comment on relevant news)
- Launch reports on industry trends
- Provide expert commentary

Technical opportunities:
- Broken link building (find broken links, offer replacement)
- Unlinked mentions (ask for link where already mentioned)
- Resource page outreach (get added to relevant lists)

Avoid:
- Buying links (violates guidelines)
- Link exchanges (obvious patterns penalized)
- Low-quality directories
- Comment spam
- Private Blog Networks (PBNs)

### Step 8: Implement measurement and iteration
Set up tracking and continuous improvement:

Key SEO metrics:

Rankings:
- Position for target keywords
- Ranking changes over time
- Featured snippet appearances
- SERP feature ownership

Traffic:
- Organic sessions
- Organic users
- Pages per session
- Bounce rate by page

Engagement:

Iteration process:
