# Income Stream Development

## Overview
Systematic process for identifying, building, and scaling new income streams.

## Steps

### Step 1: Skills-Value Mapping
Map skills to market value:
1. List all monetizable skills
2. For each skill, identify:
   - Who pays for this? (customer segments)
   - What do they pay? (market rates)
   - How do they buy? (platforms, direct, referral)
3. Rate each: demand × your skill level × enjoyment
4. Rank by overall attractiveness

### Step 2: Platform Selection
Evaluate delivery platforms for top skill:

Platform types:
- Marketplaces (Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal)
- Direct (own website, networking)
- Productized (courses, templates, SaaS)

Evaluate on:
- Customer acquisition (how do clients find you?)
- Fee structure (platform take)
- Competition level
- Fit with your skill/style

Start with ONE platform, expand later

### Step 3: Offer Definition
Define your specific offer:
1. Service scope (what exactly you deliver)
2. Pricing model (hourly, project, retainer, value-based)
3. Delivery process (how you do the work)
4. Timeline (how long it takes)
5. Boundaries (what's not included)

Make it specific enough to quote instantly

### Step 4: Pricing Strategy
Set initial pricing:
1. Research market rates (what competitors charge)
2. Calculate your floor (minimum viable rate)
3. Estimate value delivered to client
4. Set initial price (start lower to build portfolio if new)

Pricing evolution:
- New: Market rate or below to get reviews/portfolio
- Established: Value-based, raise until you lose ~20% of leads

### Step 5: Client Acquisition System
Build repeatable acquisition:

For marketplaces:
- Optimize profile for search
- Apply to relevant jobs daily (set quota)
- Build reviews through excellent delivery

For direct:
- Identify target clients
- Outreach system (cold email, LinkedIn, referrals)
- Content/visibility strategy

Track: applications → responses → calls → closes

### Step 6: Delivery System
Systematize delivery for consistency:
1. Onboarding process (what info you need from client)
2. Project management (how you track work)
3. Communication cadence (updates, check-ins)
4. Quality assurance (review before delivery)
5. Handoff process (final delivery, feedback)

Document as repeatable process

### Step 7: Scaling Path
Plan path to income target:

Calculate: Target income ÷ Average project value = Projects needed

Scaling levers:
- Raise prices (fewer clients, same income)
- Increase volume (more clients)
- Productize (one-to-many delivery)
- Hire/subcontract (leverage others)

Identify bottleneck: acquisition, delivery capacity, or pricing

### Step 8: Iteration and Optimization
Monthly review cycle:
1. Revenue vs target
2. Time spent vs budget
3. Client satisfaction
4. What's working / not working

Adjust: pricing, offer, platform, acquisition, or delivery

Consider: Is this stream worth continuing?


## When to Use
- Building freelance or consulting income
- Diversifying revenue sources
- Monetizing existing skills
- Creating passive or semi-passive income

## Verification
- Offer can be explained in one sentence
- Pricing set with market context
- Acquisition system documented and running
- First client acquired or clear path to first client
