# Job Search Strategy

## Overview
Systematic approach to job hunting that treats the search as a funnel to optimize,
with clear metrics, tracking, and continuous improvement.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define your target
Get crystal clear on what you're looking for:
1. Target role(s): What job titles are you pursuing?
2. Target companies: Create a list of 20-50 target companies
3. Must-haves vs nice-to-haves: What's negotiable?
4. Deal-breakers: What would make you decline an offer?
5. Timeline: When do you need to start?

Tier your target companies:
- Tier 1: Dream companies (reach)
- Tier 2: Strong fit (target)
- Tier 3: Acceptable (backup)

Research each tier to understand:
- Their hiring process and timeline
- Key people to know
- Recent news and priorities

### Step 2: Audit your positioning
Assess how you appear to employers:
1. Resume: Does it clearly show relevant experience?
2. LinkedIn: Is it optimized and complete?
3. Portfolio/work samples: Do you have evidence of results?
4. Online presence: What comes up when you're Googled?
5. References: Who can vouch for you?

Gap analysis:
- What qualifications do target roles require?
- Where do you meet/exceed requirements?
- Where are you lacking?
- How will you address gaps (or position around them)?

### Step 3: Optimize your materials
Upgrade your job search assets:
1. Resume:
   - Tailor to target role (use their language)
   - Quantify achievements (numbers, percentages, impact)
   - Optimize for ATS (relevant keywords)
   - Keep to 1-2 pages, clean formatting

2. LinkedIn:
   - Headline targets your desired role
   - Summary tells your professional story
   - Experience matches resume (expanded)
   - Skills section includes searchable terms
   - Recommendations from relevant people

3. Cover letter template:
   - Create modular template for customization
   - Opening hook, value proposition, company-specific close

4. Portfolio/samples:
   - Select 3-5 best examples of relevant work
   - Create case studies showing process and results

### Step 4: Set up tracking system
Create your application tracking system:
1. Spreadsheet with columns:
   - Company, Role, Date Applied
   - Source (how you found it)
   - Application method (direct, referral, recruiter)
   - Status (Applied, Screen, Interview, Offer, Rejected, No Response)
   - Last action date
   - Next action needed
   - Notes

2. Set up job alerts:
   - LinkedIn alerts for target titles
   - Indeed alerts for target companies
   - Google alerts for company news

3. Calendar blocking:
   - Dedicated time for job search activities
   - Follow-up reminders

### Step 5: Activate your network
Leverage relationships for warm introductions:
1. List everyone who might help:
   - Former colleagues, managers, reports
   - Alumni from schools
   - Industry contacts
   - Friends and family connections

2. Map connections to target companies:
   - LinkedIn: Check who's connected to target companies
   - Ask: "Who do you know at [company]?"

3. Reach out strategically:
   - Lead with value, not just ask
   - Be specific about what you're looking for
   - Make it easy for them to help

4. Informational interviews:
   - Target 3-5 per week
   - Learn about companies and roles
   - Ask for additional connections
   - Request referral when appropriate

Sample outreach:
"Hi [Name], I'm exploring [role type] opportunities and noticed you
work at [company]. I'd love to learn more about the culture and what
[role] looks like there. Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?"

### Step 6: Execute application campaign
Run your search as a structured campaign:

Weekly quotas (adjust based on urgency):
- Employed: 5-10 quality applications/week
- Unemployed: 10-20 quality applications/week
- Informational interviews: 2-5/week
- Referral requests: 3-5/week
- Follow-ups: All pending contacts

For each application:
1. Tailor resume to job description (30 min)
2. Write custom cover letter (20 min)
3. Apply through best channel (referral > direct > job board)
4. Find and connect with recruiter/hiring manager
5. Log in tracker

Follow-up cadence:
- Week 1: Apply
- Week 2: Follow up if no response
- Week 3: Final follow up or move on

### Step 7: Analyze and optimize funnel
Weekly review of search effectiveness:

1. Calculate conversion rates:
   - Applications to screens
   - Screens to interviews
   - Interviews to offers
   - Compare to benchmarks

2. Diagnose bottlenecks:
   - Low application-to-screen: Resume issue or targeting issue
   - Low screen-to-interview: Phone skills or fit issue
   - Low interview-to-offer: Interview skills or experience gaps
   - No responses at all: Application method or volume issue

3. A/B test improvements:
   - Try different resume versions
   - Test different outreach messages
   - Experiment with application channels

4. Adjust strategy:
   - Double down on what's working
   - Fix or abandon what's not
   - Refine target if pattern emerges

### Step 8: Manage multiple offers
When you have interest from multiple companies:

1. Pipeline management:
   - Track where each opportunity is in process
   - Communicate transparently about timeline
   - Don't accept verbal offers, get it in writing

2. Timeline alignment:
   - If you have an offer deadline, tell other companies
   - Ask for reasonable extensions if needed
   - Don't bluff - only create urgency if real

3. Decision framework:
   - Compare offers on same criteria (see salary_negotiation)
   - Consider total compensation, not just salary
   - Evaluate non-financial factors (growth, culture, work-life)

4. Closing gracefully:
   - Accept offer in writing
   - Decline others professionally (you may work with them later)
   - Thank everyone who helped


## When to Use
- Actively searching for a new job or career change
- Planning a job search 3-6 months in advance
- Current search isn't yielding results (need to diagnose and improve)
- Re-entering workforce after a gap
- Relocating and need to find work in new location
- Graduating and entering job market
- Company layoffs or job elimination announced

## Verification
- Target role and companies clearly defined
- Resume and LinkedIn optimized for target
- Tracking system in place and actively used
- Meeting weekly application quotas
- Following up on all applications
- Analyzing funnel and making adjustments
