# Project Initiation

## Overview
Launch projects with clear charter, stakeholders, and success criteria

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the opportunity
Clarify what the project is about and why it matters:
1. Meet with the sponsor to understand:
   - What problem are we solving or opportunity are we capturing?
   - Why now? What's the urgency or driver?
   - What happens if we don't do this?
   - What's the vision of success?
2. Gather existing information:
   - Business case or proposal documents
   - Related project outcomes
   - Market research or customer feedback
   - Strategic plans that reference this need
3. Understand the strategic context:
   - How does this align with organizational strategy?
   - Which strategic objectives does it support?
   - What are the expected business benefits?
4. Identify initial constraints:
   - Budget envelope (if known)
   - Timeline expectations or deadlines
   - Resource availability
   - Technology constraints
   - Regulatory or compliance requirements

### Step 2: Identify stakeholders
Map everyone who has interest in or influence over the project:
1. Brainstorm stakeholder categories:
   - Sponsor and funding authority
   - End users and customers
   - Project team members
   - Functional managers providing resources
   - Technical experts and advisors
   - Regulatory or compliance bodies
   - Partners or vendors
   - Affected internal groups
   - Executive leadership
2. For each stakeholder, document:
   - Name and role
   - Interest in the project (what do they care about?)
   - Influence level (high/medium/low)
   - Attitude (supporter/neutral/resistor)
   - Communication needs
   - Key concerns or requirements
3. Create stakeholder map:
   - Power/Interest grid: who needs most attention
   - Identify key decision makers
   - Note relationships between stakeholders
4. Identify potential conflicts:
   - Competing priorities
   - Conflicting requirements
   - Political dynamics

### Step 3: Define success criteria
Establish how we will know the project succeeded:
1. Define outcome-based success criteria:
   - What business outcomes must be achieved?
   - What user/customer outcomes matter?
   - What organizational capabilities will be created?
   - Use SMART format: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
2. Define delivery success criteria:
   - Scope: what must be delivered?
   - Timeline: when must it be delivered?
   - Budget: what cost constraints apply?
   - Quality: what standards must be met?
3. Define stakeholder-specific success:
   - What does success look like to the sponsor?
   - What do end users need to consider it successful?
   - What do team members need for their success?
4. Prioritize success criteria:
   - Which criteria are must-have vs. nice-to-have?
   - What tradeoffs are acceptable?
   - If we can only achieve some, which matter most?
5. Establish measurement approach:
   - How will each criterion be measured?
   - When will measurement occur?
   - Who is responsible for measurement?

### Step 4: Draft project charter
Create the formal document authorizing the project:
1. Project overview:
   - Project name
   - Project manager (if assigned)
   - Sponsor
   - Start date and target end date
   - Charter date and version
2. Background and justification:
   - Business problem or opportunity
   - Strategic alignment
   - Expected benefits (quantified if possible)
   - Consequences of not doing the project
3. Objectives and scope:
   - Project objectives (SMART)
   - High-level scope description
   - Major deliverables
   - Out of scope items (explicitly stated)
   - Key assumptions
4. Success criteria:
   - Measurable success criteria from Step 3
   - How success will be verified
5. Constraints and risks:
   - Known constraints (time, budget, resources)
   - High-level risks identified
   - Key dependencies
6. Organization:
   - Sponsor and authority
   - Project manager and authority
   - Key team members or roles
   - Governance structure
7. Resources:
   - Estimated budget range
   - Key resource requirements
   - Funding source
8. Approvals:
   - Required signatures
   - Approval conditions

### Step 5: Review and approve charter
Obtain stakeholder buy-in and formal approval:
1. Review with key stakeholders:
   - Share draft with sponsor first
   - Incorporate sponsor feedback
   - Review with other key stakeholders
   - Address concerns and questions
2. Resolve conflicts:
   - Identify disagreements on scope or approach

   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Escalate if needed
3. Refine charter based on feedback:
   - Update objectives if needed
   - Clarify ambiguities
   - Add missing information
   - Ensure consistency
4. Obtain formal approval:
   - Schedule charter approval meeting if needed
   - Present final charter
   - Obtain sponsor signature
   - Obtain other required approvals
   - Document approval date
5. Communicate approval:
   - Notify stakeholders of approval
   - Distribute approved charter
   - File in project repository

### Step 6: Plan kickoff meeting

1. Determine kickoff scope:
   - Who needs to attend? (core team, stakeholders, extended team)
