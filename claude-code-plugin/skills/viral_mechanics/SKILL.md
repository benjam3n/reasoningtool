# Viral Mechanics

## Overview
Design and optimize viral loops, referral programs, and word-of-mouth triggers to achieve organic growth

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand viral fundamentals
Learn the mechanics of viral growth:

Viral coefficient (K-factor):
K = i x c
- i = invitations sent per user
- c = conversion rate of invitations

Example: If each user invites 5 people and 20% convert
K = 5 x 0.20 = 1.0

Viral coefficient interpretation:
- K < 0.5: Minimal viral contribution
- K = 0.5-1.0: Strong viral boost to paid acquisition
- K = 1.0: Each user brings one new user (sustainable)
- K > 1.0: True viral growth (exponential, rare)

Viral cycle time:
How long from user signup to their invites converting
- Shorter = faster growth
- Can be hours (social apps) to months (B2B)

Effective viral growth = K^(t/cycle_time)
A K of 0.8 with 7-day cycle beats K of 1.0 with 30-day cycle

Types of viral growth:

Word of mouth (organic):
- Users naturally talk about product
- Highest quality but hardest to engineer
- Driven by remarkable experience

Incentivized referral:
- Users rewarded for referrals
- Easier to measure and optimize
- Risk of low-quality referrals

Inherent virality:
- Product requires multiple users
- Collaboration, communication tools
- Strongest form when genuine

Network effects:
- Product value increases with users
- Not technically viral but compounds growth
- Creates defensible moat

### Step 2: Measure current viral performance
Establish baseline viral metrics:

Key metrics to track:

Viral coefficient (K):
- Invites sent per user
- Conversion rate of invites
- Calculate K = invites x conversion

Viral cycle time:
- Time from signup to first invite
- Time from invite to recipient signup
- Total cycle time

Referral metrics:
- % of users who refer
- Referrals per referring user
- Referred user quality (retention, LTV)
- Referral channel breakdown

Word of mouth indicators:
- Direct traffic (often WOM)
- Brand search volume
- Social mentions
- NPS (promoters are potential referrers)

Measurement methods:

Direct tracking:
- Referral links with tracking
- Unique referral codes
- "How did you hear about us?" surveys

Attribution modeling:
- First-touch vs last-touch
- Multi-touch attribution
- Holdout testing for referral programs

Indirect indicators:
- Correlation between NPS and referral
- Organic traffic patterns
- Social listening data

Document current state:
- Current K-factor
- Current cycle time
- Referral program participation rate
- Quality of referred users vs other channels

### Step 3: Design inherent product virality
Build sharing into the product experience:

Inherent virality patterns:

Collaboration virality:
- Product works better with others
- Inviting is core to using product
- Examples: Slack, Figma, Google Docs
- Design: Make multi-user the default experience

Content virality:
- Users create shareable content
- Sharing has value to creator and viewer
- Examples: Canva, TikTok, Strava
- Design: Make outputs easy to share with branding

Communication virality:
- Product is used to communicate
- Each message is an exposure
- Examples: WhatsApp, Zoom, Calendly
- Design: Recipients must experience product

Status virality:
- Sharing signals something positive about user
- Social currency value
- Examples: Duolingo streaks, fitness achievements
- Design: Create shareable accomplishments

Utility virality:
- Sharing provides value to recipient
- User looks helpful by sharing
- Examples: Referral discounts, useful tools
- Design: Give users something valuable to share

Design principles for inherent virality:

Remove friction:
- Pre-filled share messages
- One-click sharing
- Native share sheets
- No login required to see shared content

Add value to sharing:
- Both sender and receiver benefit
- Shared content stands alone (no context needed)
- Personalization options

Natural moments:
- Integrate at points of delight
- After accomplishment or success
- When naturally involving others

### Step 4: Create referral program structure
Design formal referral program:

Referral program components:

Incentive structure:

Single-sided:
- Only referrer gets reward
- Simpler but lower conversion
- Good for: High-value products

Double-sided:
- Both referrer and referee get reward
- Higher conversion, more expensive
- Good for: Consumer products, SaaS

Tiered:
- Rewards increase with more referrals
- Drives power referrers
- Good for: Products with super-users

Reward types:

Cash/Credit:
- Universally appealing
- Easy to understand
- Risk: Attracts reward hunters

Product value:
- Free months, premium features
- Reinforces product usage
- Good for subscription products

Swag/Physical:
- Status and identity signal
- Memorable and visible
- Good for beloved brands

Exclusive access:
- Early features, special status
- Appeals to power users
- Good for tech products

Reward amount considerations:
- Percent of customer LTV (typically 10-30%)
- Compare to paid CAC
- Higher for harder-to-reach audiences
- Consider fairness perception

Mechanics:

Tracking:
- Unique referral links
- Referral codes
- Cookie-based attribution
- Account linking

Timing:
- When referrer gets credit
- When referee must convert
- Expiration policies

Terms:
- Eligibility requirements
- Fraud prevention rules
- Payout thresholds

Communication:
- How to explain program clearly
- Where to promote
- Reminder sequences

### Step 5: Identify word-of-mouth triggers
Design moments that prompt organic sharing:

Trigger categories (from "Contagious" by Jonah Berger):

Social Currency:
- Makes sharer look good
- Insider knowledge or early access
- Achievement sharing
- Example: "I'm in the top 1% of users"

Triggers:
- Environmental cues that remind of product
- Associations with common occurrences
- Example: "Every time I schedule a meeting, I think of Calendly"

Emotion:
- High-arousal emotions spread
- Awe, excitement, anger, anxiety
- Example: Delightful unexpected experience

Public:
- Observable usage spreads
- Built-in visibility
- Example: iPhone signature, Dropbox folder sharing

Practical Value:
- Useful information people want to share
- Helping others = social capital
- Example: "This tool saved me 5 hours this week"

Stories:
- Narrative that carries message
- Memorable and repeatable
- Example: Origin story of company

Design word-of-mouth triggers:

Peak moments:
- First "aha" experience
- Achievement milestones
- Exceptional support experience
- Unexpected delight

Conversation starters:
- Remarkable stats or facts
- Unique features worth mentioning
- Problems solved dramatically

Shareability:
- Content worth posting
- Results worth showing
- Stories worth telling

For each trigger:
- What prompts the sharing moment?
- What would user say/share?
- How can we amplify this?

### Step 6: Build and optimize viral loops
Create systematic viral loops:

Viral loop structure:
1. User experiences value
2. User is prompted to share
3. Non-user sees share
4. Non-user experiences value
5. Non-user converts
6. New user experiences value
(Loop repeats)

Viral loop optimization:

Increase invites sent (i):
- Make sharing easier (fewer clicks)
- Prompt at right moments
- Suggest contacts to invite
- Allow bulk invites
- Multiple sharing channels

Increase conversion rate (c):
- Compelling invitation message
- Social proof (friend is using)
- Low-friction first experience
- Clear value proposition
- Personalized landing page

Decrease cycle time:
- Immediate value for invitee
- Urgency in invitation
- Quick onboarding
- Prompt new users to invite quickly

Viral loop examples:

Dropbox loop:
User gets free storage -> Shares with friends for more storage
-> Friend signs up for free storage -> Repeats

Slack loop:
User creates workspace -> Invites team to collaborate
-> Team member uses Slack -> Creates new workspace -> Repeats

TikTok loop:
User creates video -> Shares on other platforms
-> Viewer watches and wants to create -> Joins -> Creates -> Repeats

Design your loop:
- Map each step user takes
- Identify drop-off points
- Design intervention at each step
- Test and optimize each stage

### Step 7: Leverage network effects
Build network effects into product:

Types of network effects:

Direct network effects:
- More users = more value for each user
- Communication and social products
- Example: Phone network, social media
- Design: Features that require other users

Indirect network effects:
- More users on one side increases value for other side
- Marketplaces and platforms
- Example: More buyers attract sellers, sellers attract buyers
- Design: Balance both sides of marketplace

Data network effects:
- More users = more data = better product
- AI and recommendation products
- Example: Google search, Netflix recommendations
- Design: Use data to improve experience for all

Compatibility network effects:
- Value from shared standards/formats
- Platform and ecosystem products
- Example: App stores, file formats
- Design: Integrations and ecosystem

Building network effects:

Single-player mode first:
- Product valuable without network
- Reduces chicken-egg problem
- Network adds bonus value

Focus on small networks:
- Win clusters before going broad
- Team, company, community level
- Critical mass within network

Show network value:
- Make network effects visible
- "5 of your friends use this"
- Activity feeds and social proof

Protect network:
- Lock-in through value, not switching costs
- Data portability builds trust
- Continuous value delivery

### Step 8: Measure and optimize viral performance
Track and improve viral metrics:

Measurement framework:

Core viral metrics:
- Viral coefficient (K)
- Viral cycle time
- Amplification factor (total users from 1 organic)

Referral program metrics:
- Participation rate (% who refer)
- Referrals per participant
- Referral conversion rate
- Referral LTV vs average LTV
- Program ROI vs paid CAC

Funnel metrics:
- Share impression rate
- Share click rate
- Landing page conversion
- Activation rate of referred

Quality metrics:
- Retention of referred users
- LTV of referred users
- NPS of referred users
- Referral chain depth

Optimization experiments:

Increase invites:
- Test prompt timing
- Test prompt copy
- Test sharing channels
- Test incentive amounts
- Test social proof messaging

Increase conversion:
- Test landing page designs
- Test invitation messages
- Test onboarding for referred users
- Test urgency and scarcity

Decrease cycle time:
- Test immediate value delivery
- Test quick-start experiences
- Test faster time-to-invite prompts

Review cadence:
- Weekly: Viral metrics check
- Monthly: Program performance review
- Quarterly: Strategy assessment

Continuous improvement:
- A/B test viral touchpoints
- Interview active referrers
- Study viral user journeys
- Benchmark against industry
