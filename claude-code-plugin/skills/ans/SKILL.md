# Analogy Search (Cross-Domain Transfer)

## Overview
Many problems have been solved before - just in different domains.
Velcro from burrs, sonar from bats, assembly lines from meatpacking.
This procedure systematizes the search for useful analogies.

## Goal
Find solutions by searching for analogous problems in other domains
and transferring their solutions. Systematic domain list reduces
the intelligence needed.

## Steps

### Step 1: Describe the Problem
State the problem concretely.
Include: What's the situation? What's wrong? What do you need?

**Output**: Concrete problem description

### Step 2: Extract Problem Structure
Abstract the problem to its structural elements.
Remove domain-specific details, keep the pattern.

Ask:
- What is the core challenge? (optimization, matching, search, etc.)
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- What are the constraints?
- What makes it hard?

**Output**: Abstract problem structure

### Step 3: Search Domains Systematically
For each domain in the list, ask:
"What problem in [domain] has similar structure?"
"How do they solve it?"

Don't skip domains - even unlikely ones may have insights.

**Output**: Analogies from each domain

### Step 4: Evaluate Analogies
For each analogy found, assess:
- Structural similarity (how well does it map?)
- Solution quality (does it work well in source domain?)
- Transferability (can it be adapted to our domain?)

**Output**: Evaluated analogies

### Step 5: Transfer Solutions
For promising analogies, work out how to transfer:
- What maps directly?
- What needs adaptation?
- What doesn't transfer?

**Output**: Transferred solutions

### Step 6: Evaluate Transferred Solutions
Assess each transferred solution:
- Does it actually solve the problem?
- What are the limitations?
- What would need to change?

**Output**: Solution evaluation


## When to Use
- Stuck on a problem
- Looking for innovative solutions
- Want to avoid reinventing the wheel
- Need fresh perspective
- Problem seems unique (probably isn't)

## Verification
- Problem structure was abstracted (not just surface features)
- Multiple domains were searched systematically
- Structural similarity was assessed, not just surface similarity
- Transfer was explicit about what maps and what doesn't
- Transferred solution addresses the actual problem
