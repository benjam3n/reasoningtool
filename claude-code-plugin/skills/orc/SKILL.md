# Outreach Campaigns

## Overview
Execute multi-channel persuasion campaigns for policy advocacy

## Steps

### Step 1: Campaign preparation
Prepare all materials and verify readiness:

Materials check:
1. One-page brief finalized and formatted as PDF
2. Evidence summary ready for detailed questions
3. Email templates drafted (3 variants for A/B testing)
4. Phone script written and tested
5. Follow-up templates ready (positive, neutral, final)
6. Calendar link or scheduling method ready

Target verification:
1. Verify target list is current (check for staff changes)
2. Confirm contact information accuracy
3. Review personalization notes for Tier 1
4. Assign A/B test variants randomly

Infrastructure check:
1. Email deliverability confirmed (recent test)
2. Phone/AI calling system tested
3. Database ready for logging
4. Response monitoring process defined

### Step 2: Wave 1-2 execution (Tier 1 email)
Execute initial email outreach to Tier 1 targets:

Wave 1 (Day 1):
- Send to first 5-7 Tier 1 targets
- Use personalization notes for each
- Include policy brief as attachment
- Log send in database with timestamp and variant

Wave 2 (Day 2):
- Send to remaining 8-10 Tier 1 targets
- Same personalization and logging process

Email structure:
1. Subject: Specific, compelling (test question vs statement)
2. Hook: Personalized opening referencing their work
3. Value offer: What we're providing before asking
4. The ask: Specific, actionable request (usually meeting)
5. WIIFM: Why it benefits them
6. How-to: Step-by-step to take action
7. Evidence teaser: One compelling stat
8. Attachment: One-page brief PDF

Monitor for immediate responses; respond within 2 hours.

### Step 3: Wave 3 execution (AI phone follow-up)
Execute AI phone follow-up to non-responders:

Day 4: Call Wave 1-2 non-responders using Bland AI

Phone script structure:
1. Opening: "Hi, this is [Name] from [Org]. I sent an email
   earlier this week about [topic] - wanted to follow up briefly.
   Is now a good time for a 2-minute conversation?"

2. If yes: Brief value proposition, request for meeting

3. If busy: Offer callback time or email preference

4. Objection handling:
   - "No meetings": Offer one-page summary instead
   - "Not relevant": Ask what areas are relevant
   - "Who are you?": Clear identity and mission statement

5. Closing: Confirm next step, thank them

Log all calls with outcome (reached, voicemail, callback, declined).

### Step 4: Wave 4-5 execution (Tier 2 and final)
Expand to Tier 2 and make final attempts:

Wave 4 (Day 5):
- Send to 10-15 Tier 2 targets
- Less personalization but still relevant framing
- Include policy brief

Wave 5 (Day 7):
- Final email to all remaining non-responders
- Shorter, more direct message
- Single most compelling point
- Clear opt-out language

Final attempt template:
"One last follow-up on [policy]. Key takeaway: [single compelling point].
 If ever relevant, feel free to reach out. Best, [Name]"

### Step 5: Response handling
Process all responses systematically:

Response classification:
- Positive: Meeting scheduled, clear interest expressed
  -> Send confirmation with prep materials
- Neutral: Request for info, not committed
  -> Send requested materials, follow up in 3 days
- Busy: Interested but timing bad
  -> Schedule future contact date
- No response: No reply after 2+ attempts
  -> Archive, may revisit in future campaign
- Negative: Explicit decline
  -> Thank them, remove from active campaign

For each response:
1. Classify immediately
2. Send appropriate follow-up within 24 hours
3. Log response type and follow-up in database
4. Update target status

Follow-up templates:
- After positive: Meeting confirmation + prep materials
- After neutral: Materials + "Would a brief call help?"
- Final attempt: Single compelling point + graceful close

### Step 6: Meeting execution
Execute scheduled meetings effectively:

Pre-meeting:
1. Review dossier and recent activity
2. Prepare tailored talking points
3. Anticipate likely questions/objections
4. Have evidence summary ready

Meeting structure (10-15 minutes):
1. Thank them for their time (30 sec)
2. Brief context on organization (30 sec)
3. Present key findings from research (3-5 min)
4. Specific policy ask (1 min)
5. Q&A and objection handling (3-5 min)
6. Next steps and how we can help (1 min)

Post-meeting:
1. Send thank-you email within 2 hours
2. Provide any promised materials
3. Log meeting notes in database
4. Schedule any follow-up actions

### Step 7: Campaign analysis
Compile comprehensive campaign metrics:

Outreach metrics:
- Total attempts by channel (email, phone)
- Delivery rate (successful sends)
- Response rate by channel
- Response rate by tier

Conversion metrics:
- Meetings scheduled / total contacted
- Contact-to-meeting conversion rate
- Meeting-to-action conversion rate

Cost metrics:
- Total campaign spend
- Cost per contact
- Cost per response
- Cost per meeting

A/B test analysis:
- Response rate by variant
- Statistical significance assessment
- Winner determination

Calculate all metrics and compile into campaign report.

### Step 8: Learning extraction
Extract and document learnings for future campaigns:

Analyze patterns:
- What subject lines performed best?
- Which personalization approaches worked?
- What objections came up repeatedly?
- Which targets were most receptive?
- What timing patterns emerged?

Document learnings:
- State finding clearly
- Include supporting evidence (sample size, effect size)
- Assess confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Define implication for future campaigns

Update knowledge base:
- Add new learnings to database
- Update confidence on existing learnings
- Archive outdated findings

Create recommendations:
- Specific changes for next campaign
- Templates to update
- Targeting adjustments


## When to Use
- After completing targeting with full target database
- When ready to execute coordinated advocacy outreach
- Running multi-policy campaign requiring systematic approach
- Testing messaging effectiveness through A/B experiments
- Following up on initial contact attempts
- Building relationships with legislative staff over time

## Verification
- All targets contacted according to wave schedule
- All sends logged in database with timestamp and variant
- All responses processed within 24 hours
- Meetings have complete notes and follow-up actions
- A/B test properly executed with random assignment
- Campaign metrics fully calculated
- Learnings extracted and documented
