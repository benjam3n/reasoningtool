# Health and Wellness Optimization

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Comprehensive procedure for health-related goals including fitness, nutrition, sleep, energy, stress, and overall wellness.

Health goals are often approached generically ("eat better", "exercise more"). This procedure provides structure for personalized optimization.

## Steps

### Step 1: Classify the Health Goal
| Type | Route | Key Question |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Fitness / strength | Step 2a | What physical capacity? |
| Weight / body composition | Step 2b | What's the target and timeline? |
| Energy / vitality | Step 2c | When is energy lowest? |
| Sleep | Step 2d | What aspect of sleep? |
| Stress / mental health | Step 2e | Acute or chronic? |
| Chronic condition | Step 2f | What condition, what's current management? |
| General "feel better" | Step 2g | What does "better" mean specifically? |

### Step 2a: Fitness Goals
1. **Current baseline**: What can you do now? (Specific: reps, distance, time)
2. **Target**: What do you want to achieve? (Specific and measurable)
3. **Principle**: Progressive overload — gradually increase demand
4. **Program design**:
   - Frequency: 3-5x/week for most goals
   - Intensity: Hard enough to challenge, not so hard you can't recover
   - Volume: Start conservative, add gradually
   - Recovery: At least 1 rest day; sleep and nutrition matter as much as training
5. **Common mistakes**: Too much too soon, no progression plan, ignoring recovery

### Step 2b: Weight / Body Composition
1. **Physics**: Weight change = calories in - calories out (thermodynamics, not opinion)
2. **Lose fat**: Sustained caloric deficit of 300-500 cal/day, adequate protein (1.6-2.2g/kg), resistance training to preserve muscle
3. **Gain muscle**: Slight caloric surplus (200-300), high protein, progressive resistance training
4. **Track**: Weigh daily, use weekly averages (daily fluctuations are noise)
5. **Common mistakes**: Too aggressive a deficit, not enough protein, relying on exercise alone

### Step 2c: Energy Optimization
1. **Audit current state**: When is energy high? Low? What precedes each?
2. **Foundation checklist**:
   - Sleep: 7-9 hours, consistent schedule?
   - Nutrition: Regular meals, adequate calories, not excessive sugar/processed?
   - Hydration: Adequate water intake?
   - Movement: Regular physical activity?
   - Stress: Manageable levels?
3. **Fix foundations first** before trying supplements or biohacks
4. **If foundations are solid**: Consider medical evaluation (thyroid, iron, vitamin D, sleep apnea)

### Step 2d: Sleep Optimization
1. **Duration**: 7-9 hours for most adults (individual variation exists)
2. **Consistency**: Same wake time every day (more important than same bedtime)
3. **Environment**: Dark, cool (65-68°F/18-20°C), quiet
4. **Habits**: No screens 1hr before bed, no caffeine after noon, wind-down routine
5. **If persistent issues**: Sleep study to rule out apnea and other disorders
6. **Common mistakes**: Trying to "catch up" on weekends, using alcohol as sleep aid

### Step 2e: Stress Management
1. **Identify stressors**: List them. Categorize as controllable vs uncontrollable
2. **Controllable**: Problem-solve directly (remove or change the stressor)
3. **Uncontrollable**: Manage response (exercise, meditation, social support, reframing)
4. **Acute stress**: Deep breathing, physical movement, time-limited exposure
5. **Chronic stress**: Requires systemic changes, not just coping techniques
6. **Warning signs**: Sleep disruption, irritability, health changes, withdrawal — seek professional support

### Step 2f: Chronic Condition Management
1. **Medical team**: Work WITH healthcare providers, not instead of
2. **Education**: Understand the condition, treatment options, and prognosis
3. **Self-management**: What aspects can you control? (medication adherence, lifestyle, monitoring)
4. **Tracking**: What to measure and how often
5. **Support**: Who can help? (Providers, support groups, family)
6. **Note**: This procedure provides STRUCTURE for managing, not medical advice

### Step 2g: General Wellness
If "feel better" is vague, make it specific:
1. → INVOKE: /gu (goal understanding) to clarify what "better" means
2. Rate current state on: energy, sleep, mood, fitness, pain, stress (1-10 each)
3. Which score do you most want to improve?
4. Route to the appropriate sub-step above

### Step 3: Create Action Plan
```
HEALTH PLAN:
Goal: [specific, measurable]
Current baseline: [where you are now]
Target: [where you want to be]

Actions:
1. [specific daily/weekly action]
2. [specific daily/weekly action]

Tracking:
- Measure: [what to track]
- Frequency: [how often]
- Tool: [how to track]

Checkpoints:
- 2 weeks: [what to evaluate]
- 4 weeks: [expect to see X]
- 12 weeks: [meaningful change visible]

Red flags (seek professional help if):
- [warning sign]
```

## When to Use
- Fitness goals (strength, endurance, body composition)
- Nutrition goals (diet change, weight management)
- Energy and vitality goals
- Stress and mental health management
- Sleep optimization
- General "feel better" goals
- → INVOKE: /po (personal optimization) for N-of-1 experimentation
- → INVOKE: /hf (habit formation) for building health habits

## Verification
- [ ] Goal is specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] Current baseline established
- [ ] Plan addresses foundations first
- [ ] Actions are specific and schedulable
- [ ] Tracking method defined
- [ ] Red flags / "see a professional" criteria included
