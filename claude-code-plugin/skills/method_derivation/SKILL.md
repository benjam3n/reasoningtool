# Method Derivation

## Overview
Derive the appropriate method from the situation rather than
assuming a method and applying it. The method should follow
from what is known about the problem, not from habit or
familiarity.

## Steps

### Step 1: Characterize the situation
Before choosing any method, identify:
- What kind of problem is this?
- What are the actual constraints?
- What resources are available?
- What does success look like?
- What has been tried before (if anything)?

### Step 2: Consider multiple methods
Generate at least three distinct approaches:
- One that seems natural/obvious
- One that is opposite or contrarian
- One from a different domain entirely

### Step 3: Evaluate fit to situation
For each method, ask:
- What does this method assume about the situation?
- Do those assumptions hold here?
- What would this method fail to address?
- What would tell me this method is wrong?

### Step 4: Derive the method
The method follows from the situation, not the reverse:
- Given these characteristics + constraints → this approach
- The reasoning chain should be visible
- The method should be questionable (can be wrong)

### Step 5: Question the derivation
The derivation itself can be wrong:
- Did I characterize the situation correctly?
- Did I consider genuinely different methods?
- Is my evaluation of fit based on evidence?
- Am I still defaulting to familiarity?

If any doubt: revisit earlier steps.


## Verification
{'how_to_know_its_working': ['Methods fit situations rather than being forced', 'Multiple approaches genuinely considered', 'Reasoning chain from situation to method is visible', 'Method can be questioned and revised'], 'how_to_know_its_not_working': ['Same method applied to different situations', 'Method chosen before situation understood', 'No visible reasoning for why this method', 'Method defended instead of questioned']}
