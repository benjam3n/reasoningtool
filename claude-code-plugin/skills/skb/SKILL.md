# Skill Benchmarking

## Overview
Identify quality standards, benchmark current skill level, and design deliberate practice to close gaps

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify domain experts
Find 5-10 recognized experts in the skill domain:
1. Search for "best [skill] examples" or domain-specific awards
2. Look for widely-praised work in the field
3. Find teaching materials from acknowledged masters
4. Ask practitioners who they consider excellent
5. Include diverse styles within the domain

Selection criteria:
- Recognized excellence (awards, reputation, results)
- Diverse approaches (not all same style)
- Work is accessible for study
- Represents your target level or beyond

### Step 2: Study expert work systematically
Analyze expert work to understand what makes it excellent:
1. Collect 3-5 work samples from each expert
2. Study each sample carefully, multiple times
3. Ask: "What makes this excellent? What would make it worse?"
4. Note specific techniques, patterns, choices
5. Compare across experts: what's universal vs. style-specific?

### Step 3: Extract quality dimensions
Synthesize observations into quality dimensions:
1. Group observations into categories (technical, creative, impact, etc.)
2. Identify 5-10 distinct dimensions of quality
3. Write specific, observable criteria for each dimension
4. Distinguish universal standards from style preferences
5. Prioritize dimensions by importance for your goals

Dimension format:
- Name: What this dimension covers
- Description: What excellence looks like
- Observable markers: Specific things to look for

### Step 4: Develop assessment rubric
Create 5-level rubric for each dimension:
1. Level 1 (Novice): Just starting, fundamental issues
2. Level 2 (Beginner): Basic competence, significant gaps
3. Level 3 (Competent): Solid work, some inconsistency
4. Level 4 (Proficient): High quality, minor issues
5. Level 5 (Expert): Excellence, consistent mastery

For each level:
- Describe characteristic markers
- Give examples of what work at this level looks like
- Make distinctions clear and observable

### Step 5: Assess current level
Apply rubric to assess your current skill:
1. Select 3+ of your own work samples
2. Score each sample on every dimension using rubric
3. Average scores to get current level per dimension
4. Identify weakest dimensions (biggest gaps)
5. Validate with external feedback if possible (mentor, peer)

Be honest:
- Compare to expert work, not peers
- Score based on rubric criteria, not feelings
- Accept lower scores as information, not judgment

### Step 6: Design deliberate practice
Create practice plan targeting highest-priority gaps:
1. For each priority gap, identify specific exercises
2. Design feedback loops (how to know if improving)
3. Set milestone targets (e.g., Level 2 → 3 in dimension X)
4. Schedule practice time
5. Plan periodic re-assessment (monthly)

Practice design principles:
- Target specific dimensions, not general practice
- Build in immediate feedback where possible
- Use expert examples as reference during practice
- Progress from isolated to integrated practice

### Step 7: Build reference library
Create ongoing resource collection:
1. Collect exemplar works at different quality levels
2. Document what makes each good/great with specific notes
3. Create pattern database (common techniques, structures)
4. Note anti-patterns (common mistakes to avoid)
5. Organize for easy reference during practice


## When to Use
- Learning a creative or technical skill with unclear quality standards
- Improving existing skill when unsure what "better" means
- Designing practice curriculum for yourself or others
- Assessing competency for professional work
- Transitioning from amateur to professional standards
- Creating objective assessment criteria for subjective skills
- Calibrating self-assessment against expert standards
- Building a reference library of exemplary work

## Verification
- Expert selection includes diverse styles, not just personal favorites
- Quality dimensions are specific and observable, not vague
- Rubric can distinguish between skill levels reliably
- Self-assessment is honest and calibrated against experts
- Practice plan addresses identified gaps with specific exercises
- Feedback mechanisms exist to verify improvement
- Progress is measurable through periodic re-assessment
