# Qualitative Outcome Measurement

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Many important outcomes can't be reduced to numbers: "Improved relationship quality," "Better work-life balance," "Increased confidence," "Stronger team culture."

This procedure provides rigorous ways to assess qualitative outcomes without forcing artificial metrics that miss the point.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define What "Better" Means
1. What outcome is being measured?
2. What would improvement look like concretely? (Observable behaviors, not feelings)
3. What would you notice if it got WORSE?
4. Who would notice the change? (Self, others, both?)

### Step 2: Choose Measurement Approach
| Approach | Best For | Method |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Behavioral markers | Observable actions | Define specific behaviors that indicate the outcome |
| Rubric | Multi-dimensional quality | Create a descriptive scale for each dimension |
| Comparison | Before/after | Structured comparison against baseline |
| Narrative | Rich, complex outcomes | Structured storytelling with analysis |
| Indicator constellation | Hard-to-define outcomes | Multiple indirect indicators that together paint a picture |

### Step 3a: Behavioral Markers
Define observable behaviors that indicate the outcome:

```
BEHAVIORAL MARKERS for [outcome]:
Strongly present:
- [ ] [specific behavior you can observe]
- [ ] [specific behavior]

Moderately present:
- [ ] [behavior]
- [ ] [behavior]

Absent/declining:
- [ ] [behavior that would indicate absence]
- [ ] [behavior]

Score: Count of "strongly present" markers observed
```

### Step 3b: Rubric
Create a descriptive scale:

| Level | Description | Observable Indicators |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| 5 - Excellent | [what excellence looks like in plain language] | [specific indicators] |
| 4 - Good | [what good looks like] | [specific indicators] |
| 3 - Adequate | [what adequate looks like] | [specific indicators] |
| 2 - Needs work | [what this looks like] | [specific indicators] |
| 1 - Poor | [what poor looks like] | [specific indicators] |

Key: Each level must be distinguishable from adjacent levels by observable criteria.

### Step 3c: Structured Comparison
Compare current state against baseline:

| Dimension | Before | Now | Direction | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| [aspect 1] | [description] | [description] | ↑↓→ | H/M/L |
| [aspect 2] | [description] | [description] | ↑↓→ | H/M/L |

### Step 3d: Narrative Assessment
```
NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT:
Situation before: [describe the starting state]
Actions taken: [what changed]
Situation now: [describe current state]
Key differences: [what's concretely different]
Evidence of change: [specific examples, quotes, observations]
What hasn't changed: [honest acknowledgment]
```

### Step 3e: Indicator Constellation
When no single indicator captures the outcome:

| Indicator | Direction | Weight | Current | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| [indirect indicator 1] | [desired direction] | [importance] | [observation] | |
| [indirect indicator 2] | | | | |
| [indirect indicator 3] | | | | |

Interpretation: If most indicators point in the same direction, the outcome is likely moving that way. Divergent indicators suggest complexity.

### Step 4: Establish Measurement Rhythm
1. How often to measure? (Daily is too noisy, yearly is too slow — usually weekly or monthly)
2. Who measures? (Self-report + external observation is stronger than either alone)
3. Where to record? (Simple system you'll actually use)
4. When to review? (Regular intervals to spot trends)

### Step 5: Guard Against Measurement Failure
| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Goodhart's Law | Optimizing the metric instead of the outcome | Use multiple measures, change them periodically |
| Confirmation bias | Only seeing evidence of improvement | Include "what hasn't changed" in every assessment |
| Precision illusion | Over-interpreting small differences | Use coarse scales (5 levels, not 100) |
| Measurement fatigue | Stopping measurement | Make it simple enough to maintain |

### Step 6: Report
```
QUALITATIVE MEASUREMENT:
Outcome: [what's being measured]
Approach: [which method(s)]

Current assessment:
[Results using chosen approach]

Trajectory: [improving / stable / declining / unclear]
Confidence: [H/M/L]
Key evidence: [most convincing indicator of direction]
Caveat: [what this measurement can't capture]

Next measurement: [when]
```

## When to Use
- Goal involves subjective or experiential outcomes
- Standard metrics don't capture what matters
- Success is "I know it when I see it"
- Multiple dimensions of quality matter
- → INVOKE: /qr (qualitative research) for deeper qualitative inquiry
- → INVOKE: /dot (outcome tracking) for tracking over time

## Verification
- [ ] "Better" defined in observable terms
- [ ] Measurement approach matched to outcome type
- [ ] Scale is coarse enough to be reliable (not over-precise)
- [ ] Multiple indicators used (not single metric)
- [ ] Measurement failure modes guarded against
- [ ] Measurement rhythm established
