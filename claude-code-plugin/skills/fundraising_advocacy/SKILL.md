# Fundraising (Advocacy)

## Overview
Build self-sustaining funding for advocacy operations through multiple revenue streams

## Steps

### Step 1: Donation infrastructure setup
Establish basic donation capability:

Platform selection:
1. Buy Me a Coffee (buymeacoffee.com)
   - 0% fees under $5, 5% over
   - Simple setup, fast launch
   - Good for micro-donations

2. Ko-fi (ko-fi.com)
   - 0% platform fees (optional tips)
   - Simple interface
   - Good for creative/advocacy work

3. PayPal.me (paypal.me)
   - 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
   - Familiar to donors
   - If existing PayPal account

Setup tasks:
1. Create account on chosen platform
2. Write compelling donation page copy
3. Add project description and goals
4. Set up payment method (receive funds)
5. Test donation flow end-to-end
6. Create thank-you message template

### Step 2: Transparency dashboard creation
Build public dashboard showing costs and impact:

Platform options:
- Google Sites (free, easy)
- Notion public page (free, flexible)
- GitHub Pages (free, technical)
- Simple HTML on existing domain

Dashboard elements:
1. Mission statement (one sentence)
2. Impact metrics:
   - Campaigns run
   - Contacts made
   - Meetings held
   - Legislative conversations
3. Cost transparency:
   - Total spend to date
   - Cost breakdown by category
   - Cost per meeting/outcome
4. Efficiency comparison:
   - How costs compare to traditional advocacy
   - What donation amounts enable
5. Donate button (prominent)
6. Recent activity feed (optional)

Update frequency: Weekly or after each campaign

### Step 3: Soft ask integration
Integrate donation asks into existing communications:

Locations for soft asks:
1. Thank-you emails (after positive responses)
   Template: "P.S. This outreach is part of an experiment in
   evidence-based advocacy. We've spent $[X] to generate [Y]
   legislative conversations. If you find this approach valuable,
   consider supporting: [Link]"

2. Impact updates (quarterly or after campaigns)
   - Share metrics and stories
   - Include transparency dashboard link
   - Clear donation CTA

3. Dashboard footer
   - Always visible donate option
   - "Support this work" messaging

4. Newsletter (if applicable)
   - Occasional dedicated ask
   - Regular soft footer mention

Soft ask principles:
- Lead with impact, not need
- Make it easy (one-click donate)
- Show what donations enable
- Express genuine gratitude
- Don't over-ask (fatigue)
