# Risk Management Orderings

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

When stakes are high and outcomes uncertain, order decisions to preserve optionality, defer irreversible commitments, and minimize catastrophic downside. Risk-aware sequencing.

## Ordering Rules

### Rule 1: Reversible Before Irreversible
- Make reversible decisions first, defer irreversible ones
- Gather information from reversible decisions to inform irreversible ones
- **When**: mix of reversible and irreversible choices

### Rule 2: Kill the Biggest Risk First
- Identify the risk that would be most damaging if realized
- Address it first, even if other tasks are easier
- **When**: one risk dominates the failure probability

### Rule 3: Preserve Options
- When uncertain, choose paths that keep the most future options open
- Avoid commitments that close doors until you have information to choose wisely
- **When**: early-stage decisions, high uncertainty

### Rule 4: Minimax — Minimize the Maximum Loss
- For each option, identify the worst possible outcome
- Choose the option with the least-bad worst case
- **When**: downside risk matters more than upside gain

### Rule 5: Insurance First
- Before pursuing upside, protect against catastrophic downside
- Hedging, backups, contingency plans BEFORE aggressive moves
- **When**: asymmetric risk (small upside, large potential downside)

## Application

### Step 1: Map Decisions and Risks
- What decisions need to be made?
- Which are reversible vs irreversible?
- What are the key risks?

### Step 2: Order by Risk Profile
- Reversible, information-gathering decisions first
- Risk-reducing actions next
- Irreversible commitments last

### Step 3: Build in Checkpoints
- After each major decision, reassess risk landscape
- Adjust ordering if new information changes the picture

## When to Use
- Investment decisions, strategic planning
- Any high-stakes sequential decision-making
- Startup strategy, career decisions

## Verification
- [ ] Reversible vs irreversible classified
- [ ] Biggest risks identified and addressed early
- [ ] Options preserved as long as possible
- [ ] Checkpoints built in for reassessment
