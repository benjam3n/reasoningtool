# High Volatility Handler

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Standard planning assumes relative stability. High-volatility environments break this — conditions change faster than plans can adapt. This procedure adjusts planning horizon, decision speed, information gathering, and commitment level to match the rate of change.

## Step 0: Assess Volatility

| Dimension | Low | Medium | High | Extreme |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|---------|
| Change rate | Months | Weeks | Days | Hours |
| Predictability | Forecastable | Trend-visible | Surprises common | Chaotic |
| Impact of being wrong | Minor | Moderate | Major | Critical |
| Information lag | Real-time | Hours | Days | Unreliable |

Volatility type:
- **Market**: prices, demand, competition shifting
- **Technical**: technology, platforms, tools changing
- **Political**: regulations, policies, power dynamics
- **Environmental**: conditions, resources, access changing
- **Social**: public opinion, team dynamics, relationships

## Steps

### Step 1: Shorten Planning Horizon
1. Standard planning horizon ÷ volatility factor = adjusted horizon
   - Low volatility: plan 6-12 months
   - Medium: plan 1-3 months
   - High: plan 1-4 weeks
   - Extreme: plan 1-3 days
2. Beyond the horizon: have directions, not plans
3. Replace detailed long-term plans with strategic intent + adaptation rules

### Step 2: Build Decision Speed
1. Pre-decide: what decisions can be made now for common scenarios?
2. Create if-then rules: "If [condition], then [action] without further analysis"
3. Identify who can decide without escalation
4. Set a maximum decision delay for each decision type
5. Accept: faster decisions with less information beats slow decisions with more

### Step 3: Increase Information Frequency
1. What are your leading indicators? (things that change before outcomes change)
2. How often do you check them? Double the frequency.
3. Set tripwires: "If [indicator] crosses [threshold], reassess immediately"
4. Diversify information sources (single source = single point of failure)
5. Distinguish signal from noise (more data ≠ better data in volatile environments)

### Step 4: Reduce Commitment Size
1. Break large commitments into smaller, reversible ones
2. Prefer: options over commitments, experiments over launches, pilots over rollouts
3. Keep reserves: don't commit 100% of resources
4. Build exit ramps into every plan
5. Cost of changing course should be low by design

### Step 5: Create Contingencies
1. For each plan element, ask: "What if this becomes impossible/irrelevant tomorrow?"
2. Maintain 2-3 alternative paths for critical objectives
3. Identify resources that can be redirected quickly
4. Pre-negotiate flexibility where possible (contracts, partnerships, commitments)

### Step 6: Execute with Frequent Reassessment
1. Execute current plan
2. At each checkpoint (per shortened horizon):
   - Has anything changed that invalidates the plan?
   - Are tripwires triggered?
   - Is the direction still right even if tactics need adjusting?
3. Adapt or continue — don't agonize, decide and move

VOLATILITY ASSESSMENT:
Environment: [description]
Volatility: [low/medium/high/extreme]
Type: [market/technical/political/environmental/social]

Adjusted approach:
- Planning horizon: [timeframe]
- Decision speed: [target response time]
- Check frequency: [how often]
- Commitment size: [maximum before checkpoint]
- Contingencies: [N alternatives maintained]
```

## When to Use
- Startups in fast-moving markets
- Crisis periods
- Political uncertainty affecting plans
- Technology transitions
- Any situation where "the plan" keeps becoming obsolete

## Verification
- [ ] Volatility type and level assessed
- [ ] Planning horizon adjusted to match
- [ ] Decision speed increased (pre-decisions, if-then rules)
- [ ] Information gathering frequency increased
- [ ] Commitments sized to be reversible
- [ ] Contingencies prepared
