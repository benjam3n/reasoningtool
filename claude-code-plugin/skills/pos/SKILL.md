# Positioning Strategy

## Overview
Develop clear market positioning through category design, differentiation, and compelling messaging

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand positioning fundamentals
Build foundational understanding of positioning:

What positioning is:
- The place your product occupies in customer minds
- Relative to alternatives they could choose
- Based on meaningful differentiation
- Simplified for easy comprehension

What positioning is NOT:
- Taglines or slogans (those come from positioning)
- Marketing messages (built on positioning)
- Product features (positioning is the "so what")
- What you wish customers thought

Positioning components:

1. Competitive alternatives:
What would customers do if you didn't exist?
- Direct competitors (same category)
- Indirect competitors (different approach)
- Status quo (doing nothing / manual process)

2. Unique attributes:
What do you have that alternatives don't?
- Features, capabilities, approaches
- Business model differences
- Team, expertise, process

3. Value delivered:
What do those attributes actually give customers?
- Benefits, not features
- Outcomes, not capabilities
- Emotional + functional value

4. Target customers:
Who cares most about that value?
- Not everyone, specific segments
- Those who value your differentiation
- Identifiable and reachable

5. Market category:
What frame of reference helps customers understand?
- Existing category you compete in
- Adjacent category you draw from
- New category you create

Positioning statement format:
"For [target customer] who [need/want], [product] is a
[category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternative],
we [key differentiator]."

### Step 2: Identify competitive alternatives
Map what customers would do instead of using you:

Alternative types:

Direct competitors:
- Same category, same customer
- Feature-for-feature comparison
- Customer knows they're choosing between you

Indirect competitors:
- Different approach to same problem
- May not be obvious competition
- Customer solving problem differently

Status quo:
- Doing nothing / living with problem
- Manual workarounds
- Good enough existing solution

Internal solutions:
- Build vs buy
- Existing tools repurposed
- Spreadsheets, email, etc.

For each alternative, document:
- Who they target
- Their positioning/messaging
- Their strengths and weaknesses
- Why customers choose them
- Why customers leave them

Customer research for alternatives:
- Ask: "What would you do if we didn't exist?"
- Ask: "What were you using before?"
- Ask: "What else did you consider?"

Competitive frame matters:
- Who you're compared to shapes perception
- Being compared to $10 product vs $1000 product
- Category choice determines competitive set

### Step 3: Identify unique attributes and capabilities
Find what makes you genuinely different:

Attribute categories:

Product attributes:
- Features no one else has
- Approach to solving the problem
- Technology or methodology
- Integrations and ecosystem
- Performance characteristics

Business model attributes:
- Pricing structure
- Delivery model
- Support approach
- Terms and contracts

Company attributes:
- Team expertise and background
- Company values and mission
- Geographic presence
- Partnerships and relationships

Customer experience attributes:
- Onboarding and implementation
- Customer success approach
- Community and ecosystem
- Long-term relationship

Finding true differentiation:

Ask best customers:
- "Why did you choose us?"
- "What would you miss if we didn't exist?"
- "What do you tell others about us?"

Analyze patterns:
- What do happy customers have in common?
- What problems do they mention most?
- What features do they use most?

Differentiation criteria:
- Provable: Can you demonstrate it?
- Valuable: Does the customer care?
- Unique: Do competitors have it?
- Defensible: Can you maintain it?

Warning: Features that everyone has are not differentiators
Warning: What you think is unique may not matter to customers

### Step 4: Map attributes to customer value
Translate features into benefits:

Feature to benefit translation:
- Feature: What it is
- Advantage: Why it's better
- Benefit: What customer gets
- Value: Why customer cares

Example progression:
- Feature: AI-powered scheduling
- Advantage: Automatically finds optimal times
- Benefit: Save 5 hours per week
- Value: Focus on important work, not coordination

Value types:

Functional value:
- Does the job better/faster/cheaper
- Solves a specific problem
- Measurable outcomes

Emotional value:
- How it makes customer feel
- Confidence, security, status
- Peace of mind, reduced stress

Social value:
- How it makes customer look to others
- Professional credibility
- Team/peer perception

Economic value:
- ROI and cost savings
- Revenue impact
- Time savings monetized

For each unique attribute:
1. List the functional benefit
2. Identify the emotional benefit
3. Quantify the economic value
4. Understand the social value
5. Rank by importance to target customer

Value hierarchy:
- Primary value: The main reason to buy
- Secondary value: Important supporting reasons
- Tertiary value: Nice-to-have extras

### Step 5: Determine category strategy
Decide how to frame your product in the market:

Category strategy options:

Compete in existing category:
- Well-defined market with incumbents
- Customers understand the category
- Easier to explain what you do
- Must differentiate within category

Example: "A better CRM"
Pros: Clear buyer, established budget
Cons: Compared to leaders, feature wars

Create a new category:
- Define a new problem/solution space
- Be the only one in your category
- Shape how market thinks about problem
- Requires more education

Example: "Conversational marketing platform"
Pros: Own the category, no direct competition
Cons: Must explain and validate category

Subcategory differentiation:
- Take existing category and narrow it
- Own a specific segment
- Clear who it's for and not for

Example: "CRM for real estate agents"
Pros: Clear differentiation, specific value
Cons: Smaller market, limited growth

Adjacent category:
- Borrow credibility from known category
- Add a new dimension
- "X for Y" or "X meets Y"

Example: "The Slack for customer support teams"
Pros: Quick understanding, clear comparison
Cons: May be too limiting, depends on reference

Category selection criteria:
- Does target customer use this category?
- Is the category growing or shrinking?
- Can you credibly compete or lead?
- Does it highlight your differentiation?
- Is there budget allocated to this category?

Category creation criteria:
- Is the problem big enough?
- Can you educate the market?
- Will others follow (validating the category)?
- Can you be the clear leader?

### Step 6: Craft positioning statement
Create formal positioning statement:

Positioning statement template:

For [target customer]
who [has this problem/need]
[product name] is a [category]
that [key benefit/promise].
Unlike [primary alternative],
[product name] [key differentiator].

Component guidelines:

Target customer:
- Specific and identifiable
- Not "everyone" or too broad
- Who values your differentiation most

Problem/need:
- Specific pain point or goal
- In customer's words
- Validated as real and important

Category:
- How customer would classify
- Familiar or clearly explained
- Sets competitive frame

Key benefit:
- Primary value proposition
- Outcome, not feature
- Compelling and differentiated

Primary alternative:
- What you're compared against
- Most relevant competitive frame
- What triggers the comparison

Key differentiator:
- Why you're better for this customer
- Provable and defensible
- Meaningful to target customer

Example positioning statements:

Slack:
For teams who need to collaborate effectively,
Slack is a messaging platform
that brings all communication together.
Unlike email, Slack makes work communication
faster and more organized.

Stripe:
For internet businesses who need payments,
Stripe is a payment infrastructure
that handles complete commerce.
Unlike traditional payment processors,
Stripe provides developer-first tools that work globally.

Refine until each word earns its place.

### Step 7: Develop messaging framework
Build messaging for different audiences and contexts:

Message architecture:

Core message:
- One sentence that captures essence
- Works everywhere, always true
- Memorable and repeatable

Supporting messages:
- 3-5 key proof points
- Each addresses different value
- Each has evidence/example

Objection responses:
- Common concerns addressed
- Competitive comparisons
- Risk mitigation messages

Audience-specific messaging:

For economic buyers (executives):
- Business outcomes focus
- ROI and strategic value
- Risk and credibility

For users (practitioners):
- Functional benefits focus
- Ease of use, productivity
- Day-to-day experience

For technical evaluators:
- Capabilities and specifications
- Integration and security
- Technical proof points

For influencers:
- Industry credibility
- Innovation and vision
- Peer proof and social proof

Context-specific messaging:

Website homepage:
- Clear category and value prop
- Quick differentiation
- Path to learn more

Sales pitch:
- Customer problem first
- Solution fit
- Proof and credibility
- Clear next step

Elevator pitch (30 seconds):
- Hook with problem or outcome
- Simple explanation of solution
- Key differentiator
- Memorable close

PR and media:
- Trend or news angle
- Big picture impact
- Quotable statements

Message testing guidelines:
- Does it resonate with target customer?
- Is it differentiated from competitors?
- Is it believable and provable?
- Is it memorable and repeatable?

### Step 8: Validate and refine positioning
Test positioning with real customers and market:

Validation methods:

Customer interviews:
- Share positioning, get reactions
- "Does this describe us accurately?"
- "What would you add/change?"
- Watch for confusion or disagreement

Sales conversation testing:
- Use new messaging in sales calls
- Track resonance and objections
- Measure close rate changes
- Gather feedback from sales team

Landing page testing:
- A/B test headlines and value props
- Measure engagement and conversion
- Heat maps and session recordings
- Exit surveys for clarity

Market testing:
- PR and analyst reactions
- Social media reception
- Competitive responses
- Industry feedback

What to look for:

Signs positioning works:
- "That's exactly what we need"
- Customers repeat your positioning back
- Sales cycles shorten
- Win rates improve
- Less confusion in market

Signs positioning needs work:
- "What does that mean?"
- Customers describe you differently than you describe yourself
- Frequent competitive confusion
- Features questions before value questions
- Long sales cycles due to education

Refinement process:
- Collect feedback systematically
- Identify patterns in reactions
- Adjust language, not substance
- Test refined versions
- Document winning versions

Positioning should evolve:
- As product capabilities change
- As market understanding grows
- As competitive landscape shifts
- As customer needs evolve

But core positioning should be stable:
- Don't change frequently (confuses market)
- Major repositioning is multi-year effort
- Refinement vs. repositioning are different


## When to Use
- Launching new product or company
- Entering new market or segment
- Repositioning existing product
- When sales and marketing messages are inconsistent
- When customers don't understand your value
- Facing new competitive threats
- After significant product changes
- During rebranding efforts

## Verification
- Positioning is based on real customer feedback, not internal assumptions
- Differentiation is genuine, provable, and defensible
- Category choice helps customers understand quickly
- Messages are consistent across all touchpoints
- Positioning resonates with target customers
- Sales and marketing teams can explain positioning clearly
