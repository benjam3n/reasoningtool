# Professional Networking

## Overview
Systematic approach to building genuine professional relationships that create
value for both parties over time, rather than transactional contact collecting.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define your networking purpose
Get clear on why you're networking:

1. Primary goal:
   - Career exploration (learning about options)
   - Job search (finding opportunities)
   - Industry knowledge (staying current)
   - Mentorship (finding guides)
   - Community (building belonging)
   - Business development (finding clients/partners)

2. What you need:
   - Information (how does X work?)
   - Access (introductions to people/companies)
   - Advice (what should I do about Y?)
   - Referrals (can you refer me to Z?)
   - Opportunities (jobs, projects, deals)

3. Who can help:
   - What kinds of people have what you need?
   - What industries, roles, or companies?
   - What level of seniority?

Note: Even with specific goals, approach relationships
as long-term investments, not one-time transactions.

### Step 2: Audit your existing network
Map who you already know:

1. List all professional contacts:
   - Current and former colleagues
   - Alumni (school, companies)
   - Industry acquaintances
   - Friends and family with professional relevance
   - People you've met at events
   - Online connections

2. Categorize by relationship strength:
   Strong: Regular contact, would respond quickly
   Medium: Occasional contact, would likely respond
   Weak: Haven't connected recently, uncertain response
   Dormant: Lost touch but once knew well

3. Map to your goals:
   - Who is close to your target area?
   - Who knows people in your target area?
   - Who might know someone who knows someone?

4. Identify gaps:
   - What types of people are underrepresented?
   - Where do you need to build new connections?

### Step 3: Identify what value you offer
Understand what you can give to others:

1. Knowledge and expertise:
   - What do you know that others might want to learn?
   - What unique experiences have you had?
   - What questions do people ask you?

2. Skills you can offer:
   - What can you do that helps others?
   - Resume reviews, introductions, advice
   - Technical help, feedback on projects

3. Access and connections:
   - Who do you know that others might want to meet?
   - What communities or groups are you part of?
   - What opportunities come across your desk?

4. Time and attention:
   - Sometimes just listening is valuable
   - Willingness to meet and talk
   - Following up and staying in touch

5. Develop your value proposition:
   - What's your "networking superpower"?
   - What can you offer that's relatively rare?
   - How can you help people in your target area?

### Step 4: Create target connection list
Identify specific people to connect with:

1. From existing network:
   - Dormant relationships to reactivate
   - Weak ties to strengthen
   - People who can make introductions

2. New connections to make:
   - People at target companies
   - People in target roles
   - Thought leaders in your area
   - Community members and organizers

3. Research each target:
   - Background (LinkedIn, articles, talks)
   - Common ground (shared connections, interests, experience)
   - Potential value you can offer them

4. Prioritize:
   - Tier 1: Highest value, warm connection possible
   - Tier 2: High value, need warm or clever cold outreach
   - Tier 3: Would be nice, opportunistic

Aim for specific names, not just "someone at Google."

### Step 5: Craft your outreach approach
Develop strategy for making contact:

1. Warm outreach (via mutual connection):
   - Ask mutual connection for introduction
   - Or mention mutual connection in direct outreach
   - Much higher response rate than cold

2. Relevant outreach (shared context):
   - Shared community, event, or content
   - Commented on their article/post
   - Common background (alumni, company)

3. Cold outreach (no connection):
   - Must be highly personalized
   - Lead with specific value or relevance
   - Keep very brief

4. Outreach template structure:
   - Line 1: Why you're reaching out (specific, not generic)
   - Line 2: Brief credibility/context about you
   - Line 3: Specific ask (usually conversation request)
   - Line 4: Make it easy (offer times, keep brief)

5. Channel selection:
   - LinkedIn: Professional context, acceptable for most
   - Email: Better if you have it, more personal
   - Twitter/X: For people active there, public first
   - Events: In-person at industry events

6. Follow-up cadence:
   - Wait 5-7 days for response
   - One follow-up is appropriate
   - If no response to follow-up, move on (for now)

### Step 6: Conduct informational interviews
Execute valuable conversations:

1. Before the conversation:
   - Research their background thoroughly
   - Prepare 5-7 thoughtful questions
   - Know what you hope to learn
   - Have your "tell me about yourself" ready (brief)

2. During conversation:

   Opening (2-3 min):
   - Thank them for their time
   - Brief context on you and why you're talking to them
   - Ask if the time still works

   Their story (10-15 min):
   - "How did you get to where you are today?"
   - Listen actively, ask follow-up questions
   - Note surprises and insights

   Your questions (10-15 min):
   - Ask your prepared questions
   - Focus on their experience and perspective
   - Don't ask for a job (this is informational)

   Closing (2-3 min):
   - Ask: "Who else should I talk to?"
   - Ask: "How can I be helpful to you?"
   - Confirm next steps if any
   - Thank them again

3. After the conversation:
   - Send thank you within 24 hours
   - Follow up on any commitments you made
   - Connect on LinkedIn if not already
   - Add to your tracking system

### Step 7: Maintain relationships over time
Build sustainable connection habits:

1. Tracking system:
   - Log all meaningful contacts
   - Note conversation details and personal info
   - Set reminders for follow-up
   - Track relationship strength

2. Regular touch-points:
   Strong relationships: Monthly or quarterly contact
   Medium relationships: Quarterly or bi-annual
   Weak relationships: Annual or opportunistic

3. Reasons to reach out:
   - Share relevant article/opportunity
   - Congratulate on news (promotion, publication)
   - Check in during career changes
   - Introduce to someone they'd benefit from meeting
   - Ask for input on something you're working on
   - Holiday or new year greetings

4. Content that maintains connection:
   - Sharing: "Saw this and thought of you"
   - Congratulating: "Congrats on [specific thing]"
   - Updating: "Wanted to share an update on..."
   - Asking: "Would love your quick take on..."

5. Don't over-engineer:
   - Genuine interest beats systematic contact
   - Quality over quantity of touch-points
   - Better to do less consistently than more sporadically

### Step 8: Leverage network appropriately
When you need help, ask effectively:

1. Timing:
   - Ideally after you've built the relationship
   - Not immediately after meeting someone
   - When the ask is reasonable for relationship strength

2. Making the ask:
   - Be specific about what you need
   - Explain why you're asking them specifically
   - Make it easy to say yes or no
   - Provide all information they need
   - Don't bury the ask (state it clearly)

3. Referral requests:
   "Hi [Name], I'm currently exploring [role type] opportunities
   and noticed you're connected to [Person] at [Company]. If you're
   comfortable, would you be willing to introduce us? I've attached
   a brief background you could forward. No worries if it's not
   a good time - I really appreciate considering it."

4. Advice requests:
   "Hi [Name], I'm facing [specific decision] and would really
   value your perspective given your experience with [relevant thing].
   Would you have 15 minutes to chat this week or next?"

5. Accept no gracefully:
   - Thank them for considering
   - Don't push or guilt
   - Maintain the relationship

6. Follow up on help received:
   - Update them on outcome
   - Thank them again
   - Look for ways to reciprocate
