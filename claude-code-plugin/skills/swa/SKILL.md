# SWOT Analysis

## Overview
Systematically identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to inform strategic decisions

## Steps

### Step 1: Define scope and baseline
Clarify what is being analyzed and against what:

1. Define the subject precisely:
   - Organization? Which parts?
   - Product? Which aspects?
   - Project? What stage?
   - Individual career? What role?

2. Establish comparison baseline:
   - Key competitors or alternatives
   - Industry/market average
   - Previous state (for change analysis)
   - Ideal state or best-in-class

3. Set time horizon:
   - Short-term (< 1 year): Focus on immediate factors
   - Medium-term (1-3 years): Balanced view
   - Long-term (3+ years): Focus on trends

4. Identify relevant stakeholder perspectives:
   - Who cares about this analysis?
   - What perspectives should be included?

### Step 2: Identify Strengths
Discover internal factors that provide advantage:

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
- What do we do well?
- What unique resources do we have?
- What do others see as our strengths?
- What advantages do we have over competitors?
- What are we known for?

CATEGORIES TO EXAMINE:

Resources:
- Financial (cash, credit, investment capacity)
- Physical (equipment, facilities, location)

- Intellectual (patents, proprietary knowledge, data)
- Relational (partnerships, customer relationships, reputation)

Capabilities:
- Core competencies (what we do better than anyone)
- Operational efficiency
- Innovation capacity
- Speed and agility
- Quality and reliability

Position:
- Market position and share
- Brand recognition and trust
- Customer loyalty
- Distribution channels
- Cost structure advantages

FOR EACH STRENGTH:
1. Name it specifically
2. Provide evidence (not just opinion)
3. Assess how sustainable it is
4. Rate importance (high/medium/low)

### Step 3: Identify Weaknesses
Discover internal factors that create disadvantage:

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
- What could we improve?
- Where do we lack resources?
- What do others do better than us?
- What do customers complain about?
- What do we avoid because we're not good at it?

CATEGORIES TO EXAMINE:

Resource Gaps:
- Financial constraints
- Skill or talent gaps
- Technology limitations
- Capacity constraints

Capability Weaknesses:
- Areas of poor performance
- Slow or inefficient processes
- Quality issues
- Inability to innovate
- Lack of scalability

Position Weaknesses:
- Weak market position
- Poor brand perception
- Customer acquisition challenges
- Distribution limitations
- Cost disadvantages

Vulnerabilities:
- Single points of failure
- Key person dependencies
- Concentration risks
- Technical debt
- Cultural issues

FOR EACH WEAKNESS:
1. Name it specifically
2. Provide evidence
3. Assess severity and urgency
4. Note if it's fixable and how hard

### Step 4: Identify Opportunities
Discover external factors that could be exploited:

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
- What trends could benefit us?
- What gaps exist in the market?
- What changes are happening that we could leverage?
- What are competitors failing to do?
- What new needs are emerging?

CATEGORIES TO EXAMINE:

Market Opportunities:
- Growing market segments
- Underserved customer needs
- Geographic expansion
- New customer segments
- Adjacent markets

Technology Opportunities:
- New enabling technologies
- Digitization trends
- Automation possibilities
- Platform opportunities
- Data and AI applications

Environmental Changes:
- Regulatory changes (favorable)
- Economic trends
- Social/cultural shifts
- Demographic changes
- Sustainability demands

Competitive Opportunities:
- Competitor weaknesses
- Market exits by others
- Partnership possibilities
- Acquisition targets
- Talent availability

FOR EACH OPPORTUNITY:
1. Name it specifically
2. Assess time sensitivity (how long will window be open?)
3. Estimate potential value
4. Rate probability of success if pursued
5. Identify what's needed to capture it

### Step 5: Identify Threats
Discover external factors that could cause harm:

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
- What obstacles do we face?
- What is the competition doing?
- What changes could hurt us?
- What trends are working against us?
- What could make us obsolete?

CATEGORIES TO EXAMINE:

Competitive Threats:
- New entrants
- Competitor actions
- Substitute products/services
- Price competition
- Talent competition

Market Threats:
- Declining demand
- Changing customer preferences
- Commoditization
- Disintermediation
- Market saturation

Environmental Threats:
- Regulatory changes (unfavorable)
- Economic downturn
- Political instability
- Supply chain risks
- Climate/environmental risks

Technology Threats:
- Disruptive technologies
- Obsolescence risk
- Cybersecurity risks
- Platform dependency
- Standard changes

FOR EACH THREAT:
1. Name it specifically
2. Assess probability of occurring
3. Estimate potential impact
4. Rate time horizon (immediate/medium/long-term)
5. Identify early warning signs

### Step 6: Prioritize and validate
Prioritize SWOT factors and validate quality:

PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA:
For Strengths: Importance x Sustainability
For Weaknesses: Impact x Urgency
For Opportunities: Value x Probability x Time Sensitivity
For Threats: Impact x Probability x Proximity

VALIDATION CHECKS:
1. Internal vs External:
   - Strengths/Weaknesses should be internal (we control)
   - Opportunities/Threats should be external (we respond)
   - If misclassified, move to correct category

2. Evidence check:
   - Each factor should have supporting evidence
   - Remove or flag items based only on assumption

3. Relevance check:
   - Each factor should be relevant to strategic decisions
   - Remove trivial items

4. Duplication check:
   - Consolidate overlapping factors
   - Ensure no factor appears in multiple categories

5. Completeness check:
   - Are major categories covered?
   - Any blind spots in analysis?

### Step 7: Generate strategic options (TOWS Matrix)
Use TOWS matrix to generate strategic options from SWOT combinations:

SO STRATEGIES (Strengths + Opportunities):
"Maxi-Maxi" - Use strengths to capture opportunities
- Which strengths help us capture which opportunities?
- How can we leverage advantages to maximize gains?
- Aggressive/growth strategies

WO STRATEGIES (Weaknesses + Opportunities):
"Mini-Maxi" - Overcome weaknesses to capture opportunities
- Which weaknesses prevent us from capturing opportunities?
- What do we need to fix or acquire to seize the opportunity?
- Improvement/development strategies

ST STRATEGIES (Strengths + Threats):
"Maxi-Mini" - Use strengths to minimize threats
- Which strengths help us defend against threats?
- How can we use advantages to reduce risk?
- Defensive strategies

WT STRATEGIES (Weaknesses + Threats):
"Mini-Mini" - Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats
- Where do weaknesses and threats converge?
- What must we fix to avoid being hurt?
- Survival/exit strategies

FOR EACH STRATEGIC OPTION:
1. Name the strategy
2. Describe the approach
3. List which SWOT factors it addresses
4. Assess feasibility and resource requirements
5. Identify key success factors

### Step 8: Synthesize recommendations
Develop actionable recommendations from the analysis:

1. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - What are the 3-5 most important findings?
   - What surprised us?
   - What confirms or challenges assumptions?

2. STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES:
   - What must we do? (Critical strengths to maintain, critical threats to address)
   - What should we do? (High-value opportunities to pursue)
   - What could we do? (Nice-to-have improvements)
   - What should we stop doing? (Weaknesses to exit)

3. FOCUS RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Where should resources be concentrated?
   - What's the highest-leverage action?
   - What's the most urgent action?

4. RISK CONSIDERATIONS:
   - What happens if we do nothing?
   - What's the cost of inaction on threats?
   - What's the cost of missing opportunities?

5. NEXT STEPS:
   - What decisions need to be made?
   - What additional analysis is needed?
   - Who needs to be involved?


## When to Use
- At the start of strategic planning
- When evaluating a new opportunity or venture
- Before major decisions or investments
- When entering new markets or domains
- During periodic strategy reviews
- When comparing strategic options
- After significant changes in environment or capabilities
- For competitive positioning analysis
- When developing business plans or proposals

## Verification
- Each SWOT factor has supporting evidence
- Factors are correctly categorized (internal vs external)
- Analysis is relative to defined baseline/competition
- Priorities are justified by clear criteria
- Strategic options address multiple SWOT factors
- Recommendations are specific and actionable
