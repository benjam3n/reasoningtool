## Overview
Raise investment capital through investor outreach, pitch preparation, term sheet negotiation, and due diligence

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess fundraising readiness
Determine if now is the right time to raise:
1. Evaluate business readiness
   - Is there a compelling story to tell?
   - Are metrics trending in right direction?
   - Is there clear use of funds?
   - Can you show progress since last milestone?
2. Assess runway and urgency
   - How much runway remains?
   - How long will fundraising take?
   - What's the cost of waiting vs raising now?
3. Evaluate team readiness
   - Can founders dedicate time (50%+ for 3-6 months)?
   - Is supporting team in place to maintain operations?
   - Are you emotionally prepared for rejection?
4. Define funding requirements
   - How much to raise?
   - What will funds be used for?
   - What milestones will this achieve?
   - What's the target valuation range?
5. Decide go/no-go
   - If not ready, what needs to happen first?
