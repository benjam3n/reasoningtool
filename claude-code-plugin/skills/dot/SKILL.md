# Delayed Outcome Tracking

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

Some outcomes can't be verified immediately: investment returns (years), career moves (months to years), relationship building (months), health interventions (weeks to months), skill development (months), behavior change sustainability (months).

This procedure provides structure for tracking early indicators while waiting for final outcomes, maintaining accountability over long timeframes, connecting actions to delayed results, and adjusting course before final outcome is known.

## Steps

### Step 1: Define the Outcome and Timeline
1. What is the final outcome you're tracking?
2. When will you know the result? (Be specific)
3. What does success look like? (Measurable)
4. What does failure look like? (Measurable)
5. What is the expected trajectory? (Linear, exponential, J-curve, step-function)

```
OUTCOME DEFINITION:
Final outcome: [what]
Expected timeline: [when]
Success criterion: [specific, measurable]
Failure criterion: [specific, measurable]
Expected trajectory: [shape of progress over time]
```

### Step 2: Identify Leading Indicators
Leading indicators are observable signals that predict the final outcome before it arrives:

| Indicator | Observable When | Predicts Success If | Predicts Failure If |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [indicator 1] | [timeframe] | [what pattern means good] | [what pattern means bad] |
| [indicator 2] | [timeframe] | | |
| [indicator 3] | [timeframe] | | |

**Good leading indicator qualities:**
- Observable well before final outcome
- Historically correlated with final outcome
- Actionable (you can do something if the indicator is bad)
- Independent (not just measuring the same thing as another indicator)

**Examples by domain:**
| Domain | Final Outcome | Leading Indicators |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Investment | ROI at year 5 | Revenue growth rate, customer retention, unit economics |
| Career | Promotion in 2 years | Scope of work, visibility, sponsor relationship |
| Health | Weight at 6 months | Weekly weigh-ins, adherence to plan, energy levels |
| Skill | Competence at 1 year | Practice frequency, performance on sub-skills, feedback quality |
| Business | Market share at year 3 | Customer acquisition cost trend, NPS, retention |

### Step 3: Design Tracking System
Create a minimal but consistent tracking system:

```
TRACKING CADENCE:
Daily: [what to log, if anything]
Weekly: [what to review]
Monthly: [what to assess]
Quarterly: [what to evaluate deeply]
At endpoint: [final assessment]

Tracking method: [journal, spreadsheet, app, etc.]
Visualization: [graph, dashboard, etc.]
```

**Rules:**
- Track as few things as possible (sustainability > comprehensiveness)
- Make tracking frictionless (if it's annoying, you'll stop)
- Set calendar reminders for reviews
- Don't change tracking metrics midway (unless you document why)

### Step 4: Define Course Correction Triggers
When should you change course BEFORE the final outcome?

| Trigger | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Leading indicator alarm | [indicator] is [threshold] for [duration] | [specific response] |
| Trajectory deviation | Progress < [X%] of expected at [time] | [reassess / adjust / abandon] |
| External change | [conditions changed] that affect the outcome | [re-evaluate assumptions] |
| New information | Learned something that changes the calculus | [integrate and decide] |

### Step 5: Connect Actions to Outcomes
The hardest part of delayed tracking: remembering what you did and connecting it to results.

**Action log format:**
```
Date: [when]
Action: [what you did]
Rationale: [why you did it]
Expected effect: [what you thought would happen]
Expected timeline: [when you'd see the effect]
```

**At each review, connect:**
1. Which actions have had enough time to show effects?
2. Did the expected effects materialize?
3. If yes: reinforce the action
4. If no: investigate why (wrong action? wrong timeline? external factors?)

### Step 6: Guard Against Tracking Failures
| Failure Mode | Symptom | Prevention |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Tracking abandonment | Stop logging after enthusiasm fades | Minimum viable tracking, calendar reminders |
| Metric fixation | Optimizing indicator instead of outcome | Rotate which indicators you focus on |
| Attribution error | Crediting/blaming wrong actions | Track multiple indicators, not just one |
| Survivorship bias | Only tracking successes | Track failures and abandonments too |
| Premature judgment | Concluding too early | Define minimum evaluation period upfront |

### Step 7: Report
```
DELAYED OUTCOME TRACKING:
Outcome: [what you're tracking]
Timeline: [start] → [expected end]
Current status: [on track / ahead / behind / uncertain]

Leading indicators:
| Indicator | Trend | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| [indicator] | [improving/stable/declining] | [success/warning/failure] |

Actions taken: [N actions logged]
Actions with visible effects: [N]
Effective actions: [which ones worked]
Ineffective actions: [which ones didn't]

Course corrections needed: [Y/N]
If yes: [what to change and why]

Next review: [date]
```

## When to Use
- Final outcome takes 3+ months to manifest
- Need to verify effectiveness before final results
- Want to course-correct during long execution
- Connecting past actions to current results
- → INVOKE: /qm (qualitative measurement) for hard-to-measure outcomes
- → INVOKE: /pcef (procedure effectiveness) for tracking procedure impact

## Verification
- [ ] Final outcome defined with success/failure criteria
- [ ] Leading indicators identified and validated
- [ ] Tracking system is minimal and sustainable
- [ ] Course correction triggers defined
- [ ] Actions logged with rationale and expected effects
- [ ] Review schedule set with calendar reminders
