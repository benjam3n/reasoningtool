# Antilogic

## What is AntiLogic

AntiLogic believes that people are already trying their best and playing their best game (thereby believing in determinism and universal compassion) and that those people's best games can be improved (compatibilism) + free will. It makes no sense, but that's because it doesn't need to. AntiLogic doesn't need explanations because it can't be disagreed with. AntiLogic is actually more logical than regular logic because inside of it, holding two contradictory believes is perfectly reasonable as long as they are optimal. Any attempt to explain it is a step below what it actually is.

## What does this mean in practice?

Even if you didn't win, did you play a good game? Did you give it your all? Did you commit fully to what you should have? The answer: everyone is actually always giving their all, thereby making everyone's life meaningful. Their brain was perfectly optimizing for their safety, strategy, efficiency etc. But this is not the end of the story and where logic would fail. Someone could say well I was just playing my best game, but someone could address that by just saying their best game could have been improved or that there best game could have been better. Then suddenly they have no excuse. If everyone accepted that everyone else and themselves was already playing their best game and that everyone else's and themselves best games could be improved, this would lead to universal compassion and universal mutual improvement without excuses.
