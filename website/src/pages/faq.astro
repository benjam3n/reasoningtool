        <summary>Why did I release this?</summary>
        <p>I believe with the help of improved reasoning, we can reach improved win-win scenarios that benefit everyone. Everyone can have their cake and eat it too, so to speak. Any intention behind a want, you'll be able to get. You may not be able to have <em>total</em> freedom, because that might include the freedom to infringe upon the rights of others, but we can satisfy basically all wants fairly easily with something I call an MITM (Man in the Middle Attack), where we trick the brain's (narcissistic) introjects, through teaching the underlying true self identity how to mature properly, without detection by the introjects. This does not mean suppressing any natural ability. It just means following the principles of rationality as defined in the about section and demonstrating through action you mean what you say and say what you mean and aren't a hypocrite and are a genuine person. Let's say you want something unethical or bad. We should try to make you strongly not want to do it, by fixing the underlying reason you may want to do that in the first place.</p>
        <p>Now this brings up a problem. Most people have no clear ethics or boundaries, especially in domains they are not exposed to. Their ethics and morals are just a product of their environment, and if their environment were to change or had been different, then their ethics or morals would have as well. So the identity of anybody who is exposed to this framework may be extremely fragile as it is so powerful. Therefore I strongly encourage caution when sharing this, as it is much better for people to reach the conclusion on their own with just a little guidance.</p>
        <p>I was basically forced to release this as the direction of AI and society was going so poorly, and I just hope that anyone who will use it or is currently using it does not try to take advantage too strongly of the people around them and allow them to go through the natural stages of development without being dependent upon you. A word of caution: if you do do this, it will eventually backfire hugely, in ways you might not expect, and you will probably be exposed eventually, so it's just not worth it to make bad choices. Use common sense.</p>
