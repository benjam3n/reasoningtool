    <details class="faq-item" open>
      <summary>Does it load all 367 skills into context at once?</summary>
      <p>No. Only the skill you invoke gets loaded. When you type <code>/ar</code> (Assume Right), only that one skill file enters the context window. The other 366 never appear. This keeps context usage minimal and responses focused.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How does it know which skill to use?</summary>
      <p>Two ways. You can invoke a skill directly by name (<code>/ar</code>, <code>/dcp</code>, <code>/rca</code>, etc.), or you can use a category skill like <code>/decide</code> or <code>/diagnose</code> which will classify your input and route to the most relevant skill automatically. Either way, only one skill enters context at a time.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why are there so many skills?</summary>
      <p>Different problems need different thinking structures. A root cause analysis is not the same operation as a cost-benefit analysis, which is not the same as generating creative options. Each skill encodes a specific reasoning pattern with its own steps, checks, and failure modes. The breadth is deliberate &mdash; it means you're more likely to find a procedure that fits your actual situation rather than forcing every problem through the same generic framework.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Which skills are the best ones?</summary>
      <p>That depends entirely on what you're trying to do. The skill list is intentionally unprioritized. Different people working on different problems will find different skills useful, and part of the value is exploring and discovering which ones work best for your use cases. The <a href="/skills">skills page</a> has descriptions for all of them, and the <a href="/getting-started">getting started guide</a> has a routing table if you want a starting point.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do I have to follow the procedures exactly?</summary>
      <p>No. The LLM follows the protocols as written &mdash; that's what makes the output structured and rigorous. But you can use the system however you want: as intended, in the opposite direction, in a completely novel way, or in ways the author hasn't anticipated. You can modify skills if you think they can be improved. The goal is for the system to be helpful for whatever purpose it serves.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is this project for?</summary>
      <p>It's an exploratory tool. It's designed for figuring things out, discovering new things, understanding what you want, determining what's true, making better decisions, and thinking more clearly about hard problems. It is not a rigid protocol that must be followed exactly &mdash; it's a collection of thinking structures you can pick up, use, modify, or discard as needed.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I use it for anything?</summary>
      <p>The system is general-purpose. It works for personal decisions, technical problems, research questions, business strategy, writing, learning, and more. The only real constraint is that it should be used for purposes that are generally good, ethical, and reasonable &mdash; which, incidentally, you can use the system itself to figure out.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How is this different from just prompting an LLM?</summary>
      <p>A regular prompt gets you whatever the model's default reasoning path is. These skills force specific reasoning structures: branching (test both sides of a claim), enumeration (exhaust the option space before choosing), validation (check your own output against criteria), and failure anticipation (figure out how the answer could be wrong). The difference is the same as the difference between "think about this" and a detailed diagnostic flowchart. See <a href="/why">Why structured procedures work</a> for a deeper explanation.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does it work with models other than Claude?</summary>
      <p>The skills are designed for Claude Code's <code>/skill</code> system, but the underlying SKILL.md files are plain markdown. Any LLM that can follow structured instructions could use them &mdash; you'd just need to paste or load the skill content into your context manually.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What are ARAW and UAUA?</summary>
      <p><strong>ARAW</strong> (Assume Right / Assume Wrong) takes any claim and tests it by assuming it's true, then assuming it's false, then recursing on the conclusions. <strong>UAUA</strong> alternates between mapping the possibility space (Universalize) and testing what it finds (ARAW) across four passes. These are the core analytical engines that many other skills build on. See <a href="/about#methods">core methods</a> for details.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why is self-improvement about finding the right question, not the right answer?</summary>
      <p>Because questions have goals and answers do not. A question gives you a direction &mdash; it identifies where you are in the search space and where you want to be. An answer is just a point. It only makes sense in the context of a question with a goal.</p>
      <p>In physics terms: a question is like a vector (magnitude and direction), while an answer is like a scalar (just a value). A question is multidimensional. An answer is not.</p>
      <p>This is why the toolkit emphasizes recursive questioning. Take any question, ask what the goal of that question is, then ask what the goal of <em>that</em> question is, and keep going. Each level up reveals more about what you actually want and why. The answer at the bottom only becomes useful once you understand the chain of goals above it.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does "all action is goal-oriented" mean for this system?</summary>
      <p>Every action someone takes is a reaction to something &mdash; a need, a want, a situation. That need is itself a reaction to something else, which is itself a reaction to something deeper. This is reverse causality: you can trace any behavior back through a chain of intentions.</p>
      <p>The key insight is that there was originally a good intention behind all action, even when the action itself seems counterproductive. The system helps you do two things: first, figure out what that original intention was, and second, figure out whether the current action is actually the best way to satisfy it. Often it is not, and the gap between intention and action is where the most valuable improvements live.</p>
