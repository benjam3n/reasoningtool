  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p>
    If you ask an AI to evaluate your plan, it evaluates your plan. It doesn't ask whether your plan is solving the right problem. If you ask it to brainstorm alternatives, it generates alternatives. It doesn't test whether those alternatives survive scrutiny. If you ask it to test your idea, it tests your idea. It doesn't tell you what ideas you never considered.
  </p>
  <p>
    These aren't failures of intelligence. They're failures of <em>direction</em>. The tool does what you asked — but what you asked might be wrong, and the tool has no mechanism to notice.
  </p>

  <h2>What this does differently</h2>
  <p>
    There are two fundamentally different operations in reasoning: <strong>exploration</strong> (what options exist?) and <strong>testing</strong> (which ones survive scrutiny?). Most tools do one or the other. This toolkit does both — in alternation — because they have structural blind spots that don't overlap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exploration alone finds options but can't tell you which ones work. Testing alone validates what you're looking at but can't tell you what you're not looking at. Alternating covers both.
  </p>

  <h2>What's included</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>207 structured reasoning skills</h3>
    <p>Each skill guides you through a specific type of thinking. Skills are classified by universality — <a href="/skills">Tier 1</a> skills apply whenever their trigger condition exists. Tier 4 skills depend on context.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>ARAW and UAUA</h3>
    <p><strong>ARAW</strong> (Assume Right / Assume Wrong) takes any claim and tests both branches recursively. <strong>UAUA</strong> alternates between mapping the full possibility space and testing what it finds. <a href="/about#methods">Learn more</a>.</p>

    <h3>Python tools</h3>
    <p>Auto-expand claims into branching trees. Visualize results in an interactive browser viewer. Synthesize findings across runs. Ground claims in evidence. <a href="/tools">See the tools</a>.</p>

    <h3>Three essays</h3>
    <p>The philosophical grounding: why alternation works, what makes a reasoning principle universal vs. heuristic, and the structure of careful thought. <a href="/essays">Read them</a>.</p>
