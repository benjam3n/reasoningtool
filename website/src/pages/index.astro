    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      If you ask an AI to evaluate your plan, it evaluates your plan. It doesn't ask whether your plan is solving the right problem. If you ask it to brainstorm alternatives, it generates alternatives. It doesn't test whether those alternatives survive scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      These aren't failures of intelligence. They're failures of <em>direction</em>. The tool does what you asked &mdash; but what you asked might be wrong, and the tool has no mechanism to notice.

    <h2>Two operations, in alternation</h2>
    <p>
      There are two fundamentally different operations in reasoning: <strong>exploration</strong> (what options exist?) and <strong>testing</strong> (which ones survive scrutiny?). Most tools do one or the other. This toolkit does both &mdash; in alternation &mdash; because they have structural blind spots that don't overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploration alone finds options but can't tell you which ones work. Testing alone validates what you're looking at but can't tell you what you're not looking at. Alternating covers both.
