# Antilogic

---

A person who agrees with advice and does not follow it is not failing to understand. The agreement is genuine. The non-compliance is also genuine. These are compatible because the advice addresses one of the things the person is solving for, and not the most constrained one.

---

A person who is stuck — who knows what to do and does not do it — is producing the best output available given everything they are actually optimizing for. The visible problem is a small fraction of the total constraint set. Advice about the visible problem is correct and irrelevant.

---

If the current output is already the best available given the full constraint set, then the only intervention that changes the output is one that changes the constraints.

---

Judgment is a constraint. A person in the presence of someone who judges their current behavior allocates effort to managing that judgment. That effort is not available for anything else.

Acceptance removes that constraint. When the judgment is absent, the effort it consumed becomes available. The person's own optimization, running against a less constrained problem, finds better solutions.

This is not a theory about what should happen. It is what observably does happen: people around non-judgmental others say things they did not know they thought, solve problems they had been stuck on, act in ways they previously could not.

---

This produces a contradiction.

If the person is already doing the best they can, the appropriate response is acceptance — no pressure to change, because the optimization is already running as well as it can.

If the person can do better, the appropriate response is to change conditions — because something is preventing the better output.

These appear to require choosing one.

Choosing "already doing their best" leads to passivity. Constraints that could be loosened stay in place, because loosening them implies the person was not already optimal.

Choosing "can do better" introduces judgment. The current behavior gets read as failure rather than as optimization under constraints the observer cannot see.

Holding both — genuinely, not as rhetoric — changes the constraint set. No judgment of the current output removes the judgment constraint. Removing that constraint frees capacity. Freed capacity allows the person's own optimization to find paths it could not previously reach.

The improvement comes from the person. Holding both beliefs is what made the improvement possible. Dropping either one breaks the mechanism: dropping "doing their best" reintroduces judgment, which reintroduces the constraint. Dropping "can do better" removes the reason to change conditions.

---

Some beliefs are more important than the rules that say they cannot be held together.

This is not a claim that contradictions are true because they are useful. It is an observation: for normative beliefs — beliefs about how to treat people — certain contradictory pairs produce better outcomes than either belief alone, and the consistency requirement is the cheapest thing to discard.

This does not apply to empirical claims. A bridge holds a given weight or it does not. But "this person is doing the best they can" and "this person can do better" are both worth holding, because what is held changes what becomes possible for the person being held.

The prediction is falsifiable: if consistently choosing one side of a normative contradiction produces better outcomes than holding both, this is wrong. The claim is that it will not — that for the cases where both sides genuinely matter, the contradiction is cheaper to sacrifice than either belief.

## Principles

**1. Hold normative contradictions when both sides are worth holding.** Not all contradictions — ones about how to treat people, where collapsing either side loses something real.

**2. Some beliefs are more important than consistency.** The contradiction is cheaper to sacrifice than either belief.

**3. What is held changes what others can do.** Holding that someone is doing their best removes judgment. Removing judgment frees capacity. Freed capacity allows their own optimization to find better paths. The improvement is theirs. The holding made it possible.
